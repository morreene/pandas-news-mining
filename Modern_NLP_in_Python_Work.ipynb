       "'Few casualties after rare earths trade war peters out By Alan BeattIe in London 9 January 2015 Financial Times This week, a trade war that was supposed to tear the world of high tech manufacturing apart ended peacefully, quietly and with few casualties. China announced plans that would comply with a World Trade Organisation decision from last year by removing export quotas and other restrictions on rare earth elements, the minerals used widely in the manufacture of electronics, computers and cars. It was another success for the United States, which has not only chalked up impressive wins against China in the world trade organizations dispute settlement process but also (by no means a given) often succeeded in getting Beijing to implement the decisions. So, a big victory for global governance? Sort of. In reality, it was the free market as much as trade rules that did for Chinas attempt to corner global commerce in rare earths. Moreover, in a rather choice irony, Chinese companies employed the very tricks that they use to sidestep trade restrictions by other governments to sabotage the export quotas set by their own. By 2010, China produced 97 per cent of the worlds basic rare earth oxide production and much of the processing business. In its submission to the world trade organization, Beijing laughably argued that a complex system of export restrictions it had placed on its rare earth companies since the mid 2000s was aimed at protecting the environment by controlling mining. In reality, as the world trade organization dispute panel swiftly twigged, it was an attempt to give its domestic electronics and other manufacturing industries a competitive advantage by ensuring a cheap captive supply of raw materials. This is a familiar pattern among commodity producing emerging markets trying to develop their own manufacturing industry. When first Ukraine and then Russia joined the world trade organization in 2008 and 2012 respectively, for example, the EU insisted they make binding pledges not to restrict raw material export, particularly metals. Chinas policy seemed to have some success. The rocketing price of the minerals in the late 2000s disadvantaged users across the world. As Eugene Gholz at the University of Texas says, some Japanese manufacturers that use rare earths as an input did relocate to China to take advantage of cheap and reliable supply. And just to provide the nonspecialist media with a nice story, in 2010 China reportedly used the threat of more export restrictions to force Japan into returning a Chinese fishing boat captain it had arrested sailing worryingly close to disputed islands in the South China Sea. Accordingly, the state capitalism here we come crowd concluded that the Chinese were, once again, proving themselves strategic geniuses. But, to adapt a saying in the oil markets, the best cure for high rare earth prices is high rare earth prices. Production in Australia, Japan and Malaysia was expanded; other sources of rare earths were exploited; manufacturers rapidly found ways to economise or substitute, as it were, a less rare rare earth for a rarer one. Happily, the United States government, rather than resort to retaliatory trade restrictions of its own, found a way to help this process along by funding research into diversification. The global price of the minerals fell and economic Armageddon was avoided.'"

    "_Phrase modeling_ is another approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our reviews and looking for words that _co-occur_ (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. The formula our phrase models will use to determine whether two tokens $A$ and $B$ constitute a phrase is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{count(A\\ B) - count_{min}}{count(A) * count(B)} * N > threshold$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...where:\n",
    "* $count(A)$ is the number of times token $A$ appears in the corpus\n",
    "* $count(B)$ is the number of times token $B$ appears in the corpus\n",
    "* $count(A\\ B)$ is the number of times the tokens $A\\ B$ appear in the corpus *in order*\n",
    "* $N$ is the total size of the corpus vocabulary\n",
    "* $count_{min}$ is a user-defined parameter to ensure that accepted phrases occur a minimum number of times\n",
    "* $threshold$ is a user-defined parameter to control how strong of a relationship between two tokens the model requires before accepting them as a phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our phrase model has been trained on our corpus, we can apply it to new text. When our model encounters two tokens in new text that identifies as a phrase, it will merge the two into a single new token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phrase modeling is superficially similar to named entity detection in that you would expect named entities to become phrases in the model (so _new york_ would become *new\\_york*). But you would also expect multi-word expressions that represent common concepts, but aren't specifically named entities (such as _happy hour_) to also become phrases in the model.\n",

      "South Korea says imposes rice import tariff of over 500 pct, major exporters concerned SEOUL, Jan 6 (Reuters)   South Korea confirmed on Tuesday it had begun to impose a tariff of over 500 percent on rice import from the start of the year, but added that five members of the World Trade Organization had raised concerns over the level. Asias fourth largest economy wants to protect farmers after scrapping a cap on politically sensitive import of the main staple in line with international trade commitments made via the world trade organization. In September, it set the tax at 513 percent, saying that was the highest rate possible under parameters set by the world trade organization. A joint statement by the countrys finance, trade and agriculture ministries on Tuesday added that Seoul would hold bilateral talks with its main foreign rice suppliers to ease concerns over how the rate was calculated. Those countries are the United States, China, Thailand, Vietnam and Australia. South Korea is broadly self sufficient in the grain, but under the world trade organization agreement, it purchased 408,700 tonnes of foreign rice in 2014, 9 percent of its demand. Under the new scheme, Seoul is still required to import at least 408,700 tonnes a year. The import of 408,700 tonnes attracts a tariff of 5 percent, and the 513 percent applies to shipments above that level. (Reporting by Brian Kim; Editing by Meeyoung Cho)\n",

    "*Topic modeling* is family of techniques that can be used to describe and summarize the documents in a corpus according to a set of latent \"topics\". For this demo, we'll be using [*Latent Dirichlet Allocation*](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) or LDA, a popular approach to topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many conventional NLP applications, documents are represented a mixture of the individual tokens (words and phrases) they contain. In other words, a document is represented as a *vector* of token counts. There are two layers in this model &mdash; documents and tokens &mdash; and the size or dimensionality of the document vectors is the number of tokens in the corpus vocabulary. This approach has a number of disadvantages:\n",
    "* Document vectors tend to be large (one dimension for each token $\\Rightarrow$ lots of dimensions)\n",
    "* They also tend to be very sparse. Any given document only contains a small fraction of all tokens in the vocabulary, so most values in the document's token vector are 0.\n",
    "* The dimensions are fully indepedent from each other &mdash; there's no sense of connection between related tokens, such as _knife_ and _fork_.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA injects a third layer into this conceptual model. Documents are represented as a mixture of a pre-defined number of *topics*, and the *topics* are represented as a mixture of the individual tokens in the vocabulary. The number of topics is a model hyperparameter selected by the practitioner. LDA makes a prior assumption that the (document, topic) and (topic, token) mixtures follow [*Dirichlet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) probability distributions. This assumption encourages documents to consist mostly of a handful of topics, and topics to consist mostly of a modest set of the tokens."

    "### Analyzing our LDA model\n",
    "The interactive visualization pyLDAvis produces is helpful for both:\n",
    "1. Better understanding and interpreting individual topics, and\n",
    "1. Better understanding the relationships between the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1), you can manually select each topic to view its top most freqeuent and/or \"relevant\" terms, using different values of the $\\lambda$ parameter. This can help when you're trying to assign a human interpretable name or \"meaning\" to each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2), exploring the _Intertopic Distance Plot_ can help you learn about how topics relate to each other, including potential higher-level structure between groups of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our plot, there is a stark divide along the x-axis, with two topics far to the left and most of the remaining 48 far to the right. Inspecting the two outlier topics provides a plausible explanation: both topics contain many non-English words, while most of the rest of the topics are in English. So, one of the main attributes that distinguish the reviews in the dataset from one another is their language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding isn't entirely a surprise. In addition to English-speaking cities, the Yelp dataset includes reviews of businesses in Montreal and Karlsruhe, Germany, often written in French and German, respectively. Multiple languages isn't a problem for our demo, but for a real NLP application, you might need to ensure that the text you're processing is written in English (or is at least tagged for language) before passing it along to some downstream processing. If that were the case, the divide along the x-axis in the topic plot would immediately alert you to a potential data quality issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The y-axis separates two large groups of topics &mdash; let's call them \"super-topics\" &mdash; one in the upper-right quadrant and the other in the lower-right quadrant. These super-topics correlate reasonably well with the pattern we'd noticed while naming the topics:\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *lower*-right tends to be about *food*. It groups together the **burger & fries**, **breakfast**, **sushi**, **barbecue**, and **greek** topics, among others.\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *upper*-right tends to be about other elements of the *restaurant experience*. It groups together the **ambience & seating**, **location & time**, **family**, and **customer service** topics, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in addition to the 50 direct topics the model has learned, our analysis suggests a higher-level pattern in the data. Restaurant reviewers in the Yelp dataset talk about two main things in their reviews, in general: (1) the food, and (2) their overall restaurant experience. For this dataset, this is a very intuitive result, and we probably didn't need a sophisticated modeling technique to tell it to us. When working with datasets from other domains, though, such high-level patterns may be much less obvious from the outset &mdash; and that's where topic modeling can help."

    "Beyond data exploration, one of the key uses for an LDA model is providing a compact, quantitative description of natural language text. Once an LDA model has been trained, it can be used to represent free text as a mixture of the topics the model learned from the original corpus. This mixture can be interpreted as a probability distribution across the topics, so the LDA representation of a paragraph of text might look like 50% _Topic A_, 20% _Topic B_, 20% _Topic C_, and 10% _Topic D_.\n",

    "The goal of *word vector embedding models*, or *word vector models* for short, is to learn dense, numerical vector representations for each term in a corpus vocabulary. If the model is successful, the vectors it learns about each term should encode some information about the *meaning* or *concept* the term represents, and the relationship between it and other terms in the vocabulary. Word vector models are also fully unsupervised &mdash they learn all of these meanings and relationships solely by analyzing the text of the corpus, without any advance knowledge provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best-known word vector model is [word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781v3.pdf), originally proposed in 2013. The general idea of word2vec is, for a given *focus word*, to use the *context* of the word &mdash; i.e., the other words immediately before and after it &mdash; to provide hints about what the focus word might mean. To do this, word2vec uses a *sliding window* technique, where it considers snippets of text only a few tokens long at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the learning process, the model initializes random vectors for all terms in the corpus vocabulary. The model then slides the window across every snippet of text in the corpus, with each word taking turns as the focus word. Each time the model considers a new snippet, it tries to learn some information about the focus word based on the surrouding context, and it \"nudges\" the words' vector representations accordingly. One complete pass sliding the window across all of the corpus text is known as a training *epoch*. It's common to train a word2vec model for multiple passes/epochs over the corpus. Over time, the model rearranges the terms' vector representations such that terms that frequently appear in similar contexts have vector representations that are *close* to each other in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into word2vec's machine learning process, see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v4.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec has a number of user-defined hyperparameters, including:\n",
    "- The dimensionality of the vectors. Typical choices include a few dozen to several hundred.\n",
    "- The width of the sliding window, in tokens. Five is a common default choice, but narrower and wider windows are possible.\n",
    "- The number of training epochs.\n",
