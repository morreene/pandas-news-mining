G20 nations narrow differences on climate change 
By Puja Mehra, The Hindu, 17 November 2015, Antalya, The world’s largest economies narrowed their differences over the stand on climate change ahead of the COP 21 talks in Paris that start at the end of this month. After “intense” negotiations that ran into the morning hours of Monday on the key issue of whether to mention the aim to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees, they included the two-degree-goal in the G20 communique. The final text did not specify the target deadline for the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, taking care of a major concern for Indian negotiators. “India has done a lot by phasing out subsidies on petrol and diesel but those on fertilisers and power are a politically sensitive issue,” Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman and Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Narendra Modi’s G20 Sherpa Arvind Panagariya briefed presspersons just before the release of the G20 communique. 
India’s concerns: The communique also reflected India’s concerns on the Doha Round of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO). “We are committed to working together for a successful Nairobi Ministerial Meeting that has a balanced set of outcomes, including on the Doha Development Agenda and provides clear guidance to post-Nairobi work,” it said. The G20 agreed, as sought by India, to increase efforts to implement all elements of the Bali Package, including those on agriculture, development, public stockholding as well as the prompt ratification and implementation of the Trade Facilitation agreements. On regional and plurilateral trade agreements, on which India in its intervention had raised concerns, the communique said the G20’s efforts will be ensure these agreements are transparent and inclusive. 
Deep disappointment: The G20 expressed deep disappointment with the continued delay in implementing the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" IMF quota and governance reforms agreed in 2010 and urged the U.S. to ratify the reforms as soon as possible. It also asked the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" IMF to complete work on an interim solution that will “meaningfully converge quota shares as soon as and to the extent possible to the levels agreed under the 14th General Review of Quotas.”  Agreement reached to implement all elements of the Bali Package 
 
G20 vows to push growth, backs India on IMF reforms
The Times of India, HYPERLINK "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Surojit-Gupta-43175873.cms" Surojit Gupta| Nov 17, 2015, 05.54 AM IST -- Leaders from the G20 countries resolved to take collective actions for strong and sustainable growth and backed India’s stand for reforms at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
ANTALYA: Leaders from the G20 countries resolved to take collective actions for strong and sustainable growth and backed India's stand for reforms at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "We are firm in our resolve to ensure growth is robust and inclusive, and delivers more and better quality jobs. We recognize that advancing inclusive growth and entrenching confidence require the use of all policy tools and strong engagement with all stakeholders," the G20 said in a communique at the end of the two-day summit which was dominated by terrorism and the Syria issue. The statement said the G20 remains deeply disappointed with the continued delay in implementing the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed in 2010. "The 2010 reforms remain our highest priority for the IMF and we urge the United States to ratify these reforms as soon as possible," the G20 statement said, adding pressure on the US to act. India has been at the forefront of the demand for quota and governance reforms to better reflect the economic realities of the global economy where India and China are key pillars of global growth. Stating that climate was one of the greatest challenges, the G20 recognized that 2015 was a critical year that required effective, strong and collective action. "We reaffirm the below 2 degree centigrade goal as stated in the Lima Call for Action." Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, the Indian sherpa for the talks, said climate change was the most debated point in the communique and the negotiations stretched late in the night to find the right balance. 
The G20 said it will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate its actions, especially against the backdrop of major monetary and other policy decisions to mitigate uncertainty, minimize negative spillovers and promote transparency. It said the WTO was the backbone of the multilateral trading system and should continue to play a central role in promoting economic growth and development. "We are committed to working together for a successful Nairobi ministerial meeting that has a balanced set of outcomes, including the Doha Development Agenda and provides clear guidance to the post-Nairobi work. We also need to increase our efforts to implement all the element of the Bali package including those on agriculture development public stock holding as well as the prompt ratification and implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement," it said. Our top priority is timely and effective implementation of our growth strategies that include measures to support demand and structural reforms to lift actual and potential growth, create jobs, promote inclusiveness and reduce inequalities," it said.
 
India for Non-discriminatory Global Trading System 
By PTI, 16th November 2015, News India Express -- In his intervention at the G-20 working lunch on 'Trade and Energy', Modi said the global trade slowdown was a major concern and prospects for rise in trade momentum remain bleak. 
ANTALYA: Seeking a transparent and non-discriminatory global trading system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said all elements of the WTO's Bali pact should be fully implemented.In his intervention at the G-20 working lunch on 'Trade and Energy', Modi said the global trade slowdown was a major concern and prospects for rise in trade momentum remain bleak.Stating that efforts to accelerate global economic growth will help trade, he said a transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and rule-based global trading system is essential for the world economy."It is absolutely vital that the Doha Development Round achieves its goals. All elements of the Bali package should be implemented fully. We look forward to a successful outcome at the Nairobi Meeting in December," he said. The World Trade Organisation's (WTO) 10th ministerial meeting is scheduled from December 15 to 18 at Nairobi in Kenya. In the last meeting at Bali in Indonesia, the WTO members agreed on the trade facilitation pact and foodgrain stockpile for food security purposes.As regards regional trade agreements, Modi said, such pacts "should not lead to fragmentation of the global trading system and should support a more liberalised multi-lateral trade regime." He also said that increasing the role of small and medium enterprises in the global value chain will help expand global employment. Balanced and sustained global economic growth also needs increase in labour mobility and skill portability, the Prime Minister added. On energy sector, Modi said, the grouping of world's biggest economies (G-20) should increase research and development in clean and renewable energy and reduce cost to make it affordable and accessible for all. Also, financial support and technology transfer has to be enhanced for access and transition to clean energy, Modi said. Research efforts should focus on clean coal technology and coal gasification while at the same time proliferation- resistant nuclear energy technology should be developed, he said. Increasing energy efficiency and moderate energy use as well as promoting an integrated global gas market were among his prescriptions for the sector. He wanted G20 to give greater voice to major emerging economies in the global governance structure for energy.
These measures, he said, "will meet our energy needs, combat climate change, and create huge economic opportunities." Modi said there were three basic challenges -- energy to power growth in developing countries, meeting the needs of the hundreds of millions without access to energy and increasing the use of clean and renewable energy. "Energy, ecology and economy are deeply integrated. That is why India intends to meet its vast and growing energy needs in as sustainable manner as possible," he said adding New Delhi was targeting additional 175 gigawatt's of renewable energy by 2022, cut fossil fuel subsidies and has imposed carbon cess on coal. "We are working on clean coal technology. We have an ambitious expansion plan for nuclear energy. By 2030, we have targeted 40 per cent of our energy through non-fossil fuel," he said adding "international support and cooperation will enable us to achieve our goals".
 
China hawks on the rise in Washington 
By Leon Hadar, Business Times Singapore, 17 November 2015 -- But before more steps are taken to contain China's rise, US officials and lawmakers must decide if doing so aligns with America's long-term global interests 
The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is one of the oldest and most respected American think tanks. Founded in 1921, the CFR membership has included leading politicians, including former US presidents, secretaries of states, and CIA directors, bankers and lawyers, professors and top journalists. And it is known for being the voice of the so-called foreign policy establishment and for advancing a centrist and internationalist US global strategy. In general, no one expects the experts at the CFR to issue policy papers that harshly criticise the foreign policy pursued by an incumbent president, especially when it comes to the major issues on Washington's agenda, like US policy towards China. If anything, since the American opening to China in the early 1970s, the CFR has served as a cheerleader for economic and diplomatic engagement with Beijing and embraced a bullish stand with regard to the future of Sino-American relationship. So it came as a surprise to many observers when earlier this year the CFR issued a report that seemed to challenge the core premises of US policy of engagement with China, depicting emerging China as a long-term threat to American economic and strategic interests, and calling on Washington to embrace a more aggressive strategy in response to Chinese moves in Asia and worldwide. In the report, "Revising US Grand Strategy Toward China", former US ambassador to India, Robert Blackwell, and China expert HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Ashley Tellis argued that "the American effort to 'integrate' China into the liberal international order has now generated new threats to US primacy in Asia, and could result in a consequential challenge to American power globally" and proposed that Washington needed a new grand strategy for China that centred "on balancing the rise of Chinese power rather than continuing to assist its ascendancy". The authors contended that such a strategy would be designed to limit "the dangers that China's geo-economic and military power pose to US-national interests in Asia and globally, even as the United States and its allies maintain diplomatic and economic interactions with China". These ideas have been promoted for quite a while by so-called "China hawks" and neo-conservative foreign policy thinkers who have suggested that China was replacing the former Soviet Union as America's major global adversary and that US policymakers needed to pursue a policy of containment against the Chinese threat. But with the publication of the CFR report in June, it seemed that this more hawkish perspective was now being mainstreamed and replacing the consensus in support of engaging China and integrating it into the international system and global economy that has guided all Democratic and Republican presidents. And, indeed, there have been growing indications that US President Barack Obama and his national security aides have gradually been adopting some of the major recommendations in the CFR report. There have been no dramatic changes in US policy towards China during Mr Obama's second term in office. But in many ways, the administration's officials have toughened their rhetoric when it comes to China and have insisted that they would not hesitate to challenge Chinese policies that were seen to be threatening to the US and its allies in the region. Hence, while the White House had initially promoted the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - the historic trade accord with 11 Pacific nations mainly as a vehicle to improve US global economic competitiveness and to provide new well-paying jobs for American workers - the emphasis of its more recent lobbying strategy in Washington has been to portray it as a major component of a strategy to contain China. So when the White House released recently the full text of the TPP, it also issued a statement by Mr Obama, which emphasised the strategic objectives of the trade alliance that doesn't include China, in countering China's rise. "When it comes to Asia, one of the world's fastest-growing regions, the rule book is up for grabs," Mr Obama stressed. "And if we don't pass this agreement - if America doesn't write those rules - then countries like China will," he stated. "And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world." This kind of rhetoric is quite different from the one employed by other presidents, starting with Democrat HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Bill Clinton - who since the normalisation of US trade ties with Beijing in the 1990s and China's entry in the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) in 2001 - tended to put an emphasis on the notion that the evolving economic ties between the two countries in the context of the process of globalisation did not amount to a zero-sum game and benefited both sides as well as the rest of the global economy. But the initial opposition by the Obama administration to China's efforts to form a regional financial institution, the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the unsuccessful pressure mounted by Washington on its trade partners not to join the new grouping, coupled with the zero-sum game approach it exhibited with regard to the TPP - America wins when China loses - are examples of the more economic nationalist American line vis-à-vis China that Washington is pursuing now. This position is certainly backed by the Republican leadership in Congress, who have consistently opposed increasing China's voting power at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" International Monetary Fund (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" IMF), and by the leading Republican presidential candidates, including New York business magnate Donald Trump, who have blamed China for America's economic ills and pledged to adopt a tougher US position in trade negotiations with Beijing. An even more troubling sign that the American China strategy is shifting from engagement to confrontation has been the emerging competition between the two military powers in the western Pacific, with the United States making it clear that it would not allow the Chinese to intimidate its regional security partners, including the Philippines and Vietnam, over the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. As part of the US effort to dissuade China from expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, the US sent late last month a destroyer, the USS Lassen, within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef, the artificial island built by China, to display American opposition to China's claim to the surrounding seas. While the American military exercise didn't ignite a military confrontation between the two nations, a Chinese destroyer did follow the USS Lassen for two weeks and issued a warning that the destroyer was entering China's territorial waters and China accused the Americans of violating its sovereignty. But more Chinese efforts to claim control over areas in the South China Sea could trigger more US responses in the form of US naval vessels operating in the region, hoping that its strong military pressure in the region will restrain the Chinese. The Americans are also counting on the support of the Philippines, Japan, and Malaysia for this tough posture on China. The main problem with the Obama administration's tougher approach on China is that, like many of President Obama's foreign policy moves, it does not reflect a new and coherent grand strategy but amounts to reactive ad-hoc responses to Chinese moves. Perhaps before Washington takes more steps to contain China's rise, officials and lawmakers should decide whether the policy promoted by the China hawks aligns with long-term US global interests. The Obama administration's officials have insisted that they would not hesitate to challenge Chinese moves seen to be threatening to the US and its allies. 
 
Time for cost-benefit analysis of all free-trade deals 
By Sushim Banerjee, Financial Express, 17 November 2015 -- One of the significant results of globalisation has been the respect for fair and free trade. Any deviation from the established rule of laws in iron and steel industry has been met by the industry with the help of WTO-compliant rules and guidelines. Looking from this angle, there is no irrationality on the part of domestic industry seeking support and help from the government to provide some relief from the threat of cheap and rising imports. 
In the midst of falling domestic demand, almost all steel-producing countries have shifted focus to export market. Unfortunately in the global market the glut in availability, much in excess of demand, has a depressive impact on prices and in all product categories the export prices happen to be invariably lower than domestic prices of similar product categories. As there is ample evidence that the cheap import prices have caused injury to the domestic manufacturers in terms of lower price realisation and an adverse impact on their profitability, loss in market share leading to loss of job opportunities and income, duties and levies for export cargo as well as subsidised loans enjoyed by the exporting units in other countries, the ground was appropriate to adopt anti-dumping and countervailing duties against imports.  The global market access is therefore getting shrunk in the last few months. High-volume products like HRC, CRC, plates, coated products, re-bar, SS flats and electrical sheets are all subjected to additional duties in the form of anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard duties. The countries involved are USA, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU, China, Korea, Japan, Russia, Turkey, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Canada, Brazil to name a few.  The question remains how effectively these measures can minimise the adverse impact of rising imports and its market-distorting practices by predatory pricing and taking advantage of free-trade agreements? In September, India imposed safeguard duty of 20% on HR Coils imports (> 600mm width) of standard basic grade. It is early to come to any conclusion on the effectiveness of this measure as the impact would be visible from November only.  India had earlier imposed anti-dumping duty on imports of SS CR Coils (600- 1250mm widths) of thickness upto 4 mm originating or exported from China, Korea, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU, South Africa, Taipei, Thailand and USA in 2009 for a period of 5 years. It is seen that that anti-dumping duty had failed to restrict imports primarily on two counts. First, following imposition of duty, the imports in width >250 mm have gone up by almost 300% and the goods have actually been slit to lower widths and exported as per customer requirement. Second, there is also the evidence of circumventing the rule of origin by changing the origin of the product in order to come out of the purview of the anti-dumping order. The continuous price cutting by the exporters had a severe damaging impact on the normal realisation of the domestic manufacturer whose selling price was not able to cover its rising cost of production. It goes to the credit of India's anti-dumping authority to be convinced about the damaging impact while reviewing the case and they have rightly extended the anti-dumping duty on the basis of a fresh investigation for another period of 5 years. The SS industry has appealed to the government for raising the basic customs duty on SS flats from the current 7.5% to 12.5 as done for mild carbon steel. The impact of safeguard duty on HRC is to be similarly monitored with respect to circumvention aspect which remains a risk area once the duty is imposed on specific widths basis. We still have no monitoring mechanism to estimate the import booking volume to gauge its possible impact rather than depending on post facto analysis. A cost-benefit analysis of all FTAs is also much needed.

‘Red supply chain’ to be recognized, not feared
By Mark Lin, Taipei Times, 17 November 2015 -- There have been numerous reports in the media about the so-called “red supply chain,” saying that China’s electronics industry is gradually displacing Taiwan’s.
Reports have said that, for China, the stage of providing cheap labor for assembling high-tech equipment has passed and that it has succeeded in joining the supply chain for precision parts for Apple Inc.
China is an important manufacturing center in East Asia and Beijing is implementing various policy incentives to bolster the nation’s electronics industry in an effort to place it at the heart of the Asia-Pacific supply chain. Following these developments, Taiwan has become sensitive to the term “red supply chain.”
In September 2013, the Financial Times published a report on the “red supply chain,” saying that the number of Chinese companies involved in manufacturing parts for Apple had doubled from eight in 2011 to 16 in 2013. The report said that the upgrading of China’s tech companies was a direct threat to Taiwanese, Japanese and South Korean firms, which are the main forces in the global electronics supply chain.
Delayed orders by information technology firms, especially Apple, have caused original equipment manufacturing exports to shrink, adding to Taiwan’s already slack export figures. This has caused concern that the “red supply chain” is gradually taking Taiwan’s place. Can the “red supply chain” prevail? There are doubts about this even within China, because its manufacturing sector finds itself in a predicament. The road to high-end, high-added-value manufacturing remains fraught with difficulties, because China continues to cling to low-end manufacturing. Although China boasts large macroeconomic statistics, it still cannot be called an economic power. The biggest 500 Chinese companies cannot compete with corporations such as General Electric, Siemens or Toyota. With regard to general indices, such as branding, technology, management and profits, it still has a long way to go. Following China’s entry into the WTO, Europe and the US stopped competing with emerging economies in terms of productive power. Instead, they have turned to cutting-edge technology and brand management, cementing their control over the upstream of the supply chain to consolidate their own competitive advantages. For example, quality makes up a greater part of US economic growth, with technological progress contributing as much as 80 percent to economic growth, whereas in China, the contribution of technological progress is less than 50 percent. If China fails to upgrade its core technological abilities, it would remain a long way from becoming an economic power. From the perspective of global value chains, the “red supply chain” is nothing to fear. The concept of global value chains is similar to sharing a cake, whereby some nations eat the rich fillings of the cake, some settle for the crumbs, while others do not even get to see the cake. China’s share in the international trade division of labor is the equivalent of the crumbs; it is not advanced enough to enjoy the rich fillings of the cake. Nonetheless, the “red supply chain” offers some revelations. If Taiwanese companies that are chasing after the crumbs do not promote innovative and fresh manufacturing technologies to strengthen their business structure, they are to have a hard time avoiding being hunted down by the “red supply chain.”
 
500,000-ton Cuban market would be ‘beneficial’ to U.S. rice farmers 
By Forrest Laws, Delta Farm Press, 16 November 2015 -- How much rice could the United States sell Cuba if all the political, financial and other hurdles that have brought U.S. rice shipments to the island to a standstill in recent years were permanently removed? That’s been a subject of considerable speculation in the U.S. rice community since President Obama and President Raul Castro announced the United States and Cuba would restore full diplomatic ties last Dec. 17. Most rice industry members know a number of obstacles such as the 50-plus-year-old trade embargo against Cuba and restrictions on providing credit to finance Cuban purchases have to be removed. But what happens if those are cleared and shipments of U.S. rice begin arriving in Cuban ports again? “If the U.S. exported the same amount of rice it did in the late 1950s and 1960s – around 150,000 to 160,000 tons – Cuba would be the seventh largest U.S. rice market today,” says Nathan Childs, senior agricultural economist with the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" USDA’s Economic Research Service. Dr. Childs, who has been analyzing the U.S. and global rice markets for more than 20 years, discussed the outlook for U.S. and Cuba trade, during a University of Arkansas Systems Division of Agriculture Food and Agribusiness Webinar. Stephen Zahniser, a USDA economist specializing in trade with Mexico, was also a presenter. After the passage of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, the U.S. shipped from 150,000 to 175,000 tons, mostly of milled, rice to Cuba a year until 2008 when exports peaked and began to decline. Most of the shipments were of milled rice. 
U.S. rice exports fading away 
According to Zahniser, Cuba was never enthusiastic about importing products from the U.S. after nearly 40 years of the trade embargo. Then the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" U.S. Treasury Department tightened restrictions on extending credit to Cuba, and imports of U.S. rice and other products gradually began to fade away. Now most of Cuba’s rice imports come from Vietnam nearly half a world away, although U.S. rice is considered to be of higher quality and would take much less time to reach Cuban ports than the Vietnamese. “Many of you might remember the U.S. was the largest rice exporter until the early 1980s and the second largest for a number of years,” Dr. Childs notes. “But Asian exporters have overtaken the U.S. and the U.S is now the fifth largest rice exporting country. And, although global trade is increasing, the U.S. share of global trade is declining. “The U.S. exports about half its crop each year. That's true about the South and California. Long-grain is usually 70 percent of shipments so the bulk of U.S. exports are that long-grain from the south.” 
Rough rice makes up a third of U.S. exports. “The U.S. is the only major exporter that ships rough rice out of the region. Some of the South American exporters will ship rice locally.  Cambodia will ship it into Vietnam. But the major Asian exporters do not ship rough rice out of the region.”  Latin America is the largest market for U.S. rice, taking more than half of U.S. exports and more than 70 percent of southern long-grain shipments. Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia are the largest markets for the U.S. rice in Latin America.  In the Southeast Asian import market, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia, “the U.S. is not priced competitive and ships very little rice,” says Dr. Childs. The U.S. ships very little rice to South Asia which actually is mostly countries that export rice.” The United States also has lost share in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently the largest rice importing region in the world. “It's absolutely the largest – despite the fact that production has been increasing,” says Childs. “It's growing consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa. “And to East Asia, almost all U.S. sales are the WTO sales. And that's almost all California rice.  That's going to be Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and little bit to Hong Kong. But it's not part of WTO. Again, most of U.S. shipments to East Asia, medium grain California.” The U.S. faces strong competition in the Middle East from Asian and South American suppliers, and U.S. imports to Iraq and Iran, two large buyers in the Middle East, are volatile and hard to predict “They come in and buy rice; then they go out,” says Childs.  “What I'm leading to is that a 500,000- ton market in nearby Cuba with Cuba mostly taking milled rice would be very beneficial to the U.S. rice industry,” he notes. The U.S. has a lot of advantages in the Cuban market, a market it once dominated, says Childs. Shipping is probably about two days from the Gulf or less, compared to more than 30 days for Asian suppliers. “I think some of the Asian shipments can be up to 40, 45 days. As such, the U.S. can ship small amounts compared to the Asian shipments, which will be well over 25,000 tons. And shipping small amounts reduces storage needs and financial outlays. The U.S can ship to smaller ports in the north which are closer to some consumers instead of having to go to deep water.” Cubans have a long history of preferring high quality U.S rice over lower priced Asian rice – if they have the income to buy it, says Childs. “And the U.S. sells rough, brown and milled rice while Vietnam, the major supplier now to Cuba, exports only milled rice.” There are disadvantages, including the higher prices for U.S. rice compared to Vietnam and other rice-producing countries in Asia. Vietnam has been as much as $220 per ton lower than U.S. “With Thailand the U.S. is pretty much a solid $200 a ton higher,” says Dr. Childs. “U.S. price quotes now are above Brazil but the U.S. has typically been quite competitive with Brazil and Argentina.” 
 
González: New EU trade strategy has right 'software' to boost growth 
EurActiv.com, 16 November 2015  -- The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Commission's Trade for All strategy, unveiled in October, gives the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU the proper tools to chase emerging and growing markets, said Arancha González, in an interview with EurActiv. Arancha González is the Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, the joint agency of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the World Trade Organization. She spoke to EurActiv's Editor-in-Chief, Daniela Vincenti. 
-          What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Commission's new trade strategy? 
The main strength is that it tackles the two ingredients necessary for any trade agreement to work: making trade possible, and making trade happen. A trade strategy, by necessity, has to focus on making trade possible, levelling the playing field. From this point of view, it is absolutely spot on - not on focusing on tariffs, as that is yesterday’s business, but non-tariff barriers, which are the 21st century’s trade barriers. It goes beyond just goods and incorporates services. This is the way forward. Digital commerce, the movement of professionals, these are the underlying factors that provide services, so the focus is on these too. The strategy has the right software to level the playing field, from a trade-barriers perspective, as well as having the right idea about for whom trade should be facilitated. Not just big corporations. In reality, trade policy is more useful for small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up more than 90% of the economic tissue of our countries, more than 70% of employment and more than 50% of contributions to GDP. This is where the trade policy gets it right. It’s no coincidence that small and medium-sized enterprises are gathering momentum everywhere, here in Europe, in the G20, in the United Nations Global Goals, in the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. So, everywhere, people are realising that trade policies need to work for these companies. The big guys already know how to make it work. It’s the smaller players that need to be given more focus. 
I am also a fan of how it packages measures that underpin the values of trade policy today. It’s not enough to merely say that you want to eliminate trade barriers. It’s important to put it into context. The context, in this instance, is very clearly defined - sustainable trade, inclusive trade, climate-and-environmentally-friendly trade, ethical trade etc. From this point of view, it makes a lot of sense, because it is compatible with the values of European consumers, who are, at the end of the day, the beneficiaries of (this) trade policy. The very clear signal against corruption and trade policies’ role in fighting corruption is a huge strength also. Corruption is a huge tax on small and medium enterprises. We survey thousands of companies worldwide, in order to create a topographical map of trade barriers, and corruption is right up there as the biggest obstacle. As I told the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Parliament, this is as useful to European SMEs as it is to foreign SMEs. This is not a case of the virtuous North talking to the corrupt South. Corruption is a problem everywhere. In terms of weaknesses, I haven’t seen enough economic empowerment for women, which is a big factor in providing inclusive trade. I was asked by some parliamentarians whether I meant women as consumers, or women as producers. My answer was that I’m talking about women as economic actors. 
Studies also show us that women spend 90% of money on their family and in their community. This is compared with a 40% average for men. So we know that the spending patterns of women are linked to reducing extreme poverty, one of the main objectives of the 2030 agenda. It’s a no-brainer. I didn’t see much in the communication about women’s empowerment. 
-          You said making trade possible and making trade happen … 
Yes, making it possible is one thing, making it a reality is another. There are two parts to this. The first is implementing the policy. This means that the job of the negotiators is not over when the agreements are signed. This is, in fact, when the real job begins. The mindset changes. It’s no longer a question of making concessions, it’s about working with businesses. That’s the internal side. The external side is linking trade with development aid, and the private sector. Europe is spending a lot of money on trade aid, but it needs to be better linked to development cooperation strategy. The private sector has a huge role to play in this. European businesses are very active, very vibrant and quite frankly, countries want to see more economic development in development cooperation with the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU. This package offers all this. More effort to build the markets and jobs in the south means the people in the south don’t have to leave to find jobs elsewhere. 
-          Do you think the Commission has learned the lessons from TTIP and has injected enough transparency in this new trade strategy? 
In my view, the answer to the angst generated by these kind of negotiations, is the fact that this communication guarantees that regulatory standards can only be improved or tightened. 
There cannot be any damping down. They can only be upgraded. This is more valuable than mere transparency. I’ve been a trade negotiator and there is scope for transparency, especially when the objectives are being defined. There must be full transparency at this point and a good dialogue with your stakeholders. In the course of the negotiations, there has to be a little bit of transparency and room for discretion, because no international organisation or nation negotiates in the spotlight. It just doesn’t happen. A balance has to be struck. Then at the end of the agreement: full transparency once again. 
People need to see what is on the table before it is signed. Remember, the Commission may be negotiating, but ir will not green-light or validate it. There’s a political process for this. 
-          In terms of substance, can we say that there is a pivot to Asia? 
My sense is that the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU is chasing growing, emerging markets and developing countries that are growing. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU strategy has a strong multilateral root, on which it build it up with smaller economies, through trade agreements. This was the case with the ACP countries, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Central America, Peru and Mexico. Chasing these smaller economies complements the strategy with the bigger players in the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. If the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO economies aren’t moving fast enough for the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU, it moves on to striking agreements with larger partners outside of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. This was the case with the US, and what has been started with Japan. It’s also the same with Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN countries. The big shift happened when the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU went after the big economies that were off limits to trade policy at a bilateral level. 
-          Is anyone missing? 
Of course. There are two big parts missing. Russia and China. For China, it’s a gradual process, starting with investment. Once that’s been tested, it will move into a potential free trade agreement. 
-          Do you think starting similar processes with Taiwan and Hong Kong will create tensions? 
The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU has already told Taiwan ‘let’s do an investment agreement’. I helped facilitate the entry of China into the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO, which coincided with the entry of Taiwan - let’s say Chinese Taipei, into the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. It was very carefully done and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU, as well as other countries, were very careful to make sure it did not impeded the two from conducting their own talks in a more harmonious way. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU is always careful that it doesn’t pull the rug in any specific direction. 
-          What about the multilateral track? 
I would say two things. First, the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO is functioning well across some of its departments. In trade negotiations, it’s not functioning so well. I wouldn’t say this was a conjunctural issue, this is a deep-rooted issue, based on a re-balancing of the world economy and increased number of large stakeholders. It’s a geopolitical problem, not a problem of trade-concessions. The only avenue left for the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO is to be more pragmatic and use smaller packages to circumnavigate these issues, as we are seeing with environmental goods and services. It’s the only way, in my view, that the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO’s negotiating department will keep functioning. The next task will be for the department to bring order to the regional bilateral agreements being negotiated and see where the areas of convergence are and whether it can be expanded to multilateral agreements. They need to identify the areas of divergence where negotiating is needed. Instead of starting multilateral, it will end up multilateral.
