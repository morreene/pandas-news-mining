Steel makers build case for anti-dumping duties on imports 
Debabrata Das, Amiti Sen, Business Line (The Hindu), 21 September 2015 -- Safeguard duties imposed on imports temporary, less effective After getting a temporary relief in the form of 20 per cent safeguard duty on certain types of steel imports, the domestic industry has started to build up a case for imposition of anti-dumping duties. Anti-dumping duties are preferred over safeguard duties as these can be applied over a longer period of time and need not be progressively lowered in the period of application. “The domestic steel industry is keen that the government should impose anti-dumping duties on imports, but we need data of injury suffered by domestic producers over at least a nine-month period. Moreover, dumping has to be established too by the industry,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine. The industry claims that it would not be hard to prove that dumping — which means that imports are taking place at prices lower than those prevailing in the home markets of the sellers — is taking place. “While the South Korean and Japanese steelmakers are selling flat products at around $500 a tonne in their home markets, in India, they are selling the same for around $300 a tonne,” a senior industry official said. Indian steel producers say that they attempted to sell steel in Korea and Japan, but their tenders were not accepted as these countries were keen on protecting their steel makers. The industry is now trying to collect the requisite data for imposition of anti-dumping duties and is hopeful that it would have the required numbers over the next couple of months. Imposition of anti-dumping duties is usually for five years. These need to be reviewed only if interested parties submit that there has been a change in the ground situation. In case of safeguard duties, not only does it have to be progressively lowered if it is imposed for more than one year, there has to be a mandatory mid-term review in case the imposition period is three years. The duties have to be removed if injury due to high imports can no longer be proved. Both duties are permissible under the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation rules.
Cost disadvantage: The industry expects steel prices to remain at around $350-400 a tonne even after the safeguard duty expires in 200 days. The Indian Steel Association, a representative body for domestic steelmakers, claims that the local industry is at a cost disadvantage which is why they will be unable to compete with imports at around $300 a tonne. According to data furnished by the association, domestic steelmakers have a disadvantage of about $30 per tonne on higher interest costs, $20 per tonne on logistics, $35 a tonne on infrastructure, $7 a tonne on inter-state taxes, $7 a tonne on District Mineral Foundation and Forest Development Tax outgo on iron ore mining. “All this adds up to around $100 a tonne cost disadvantage for the domestic industry. However, we are competitive. But that competitiveness can last till prices hover around $400 a tonne,” the official quoted above said.
 
China's dumped steel leaves UK industry facing fight for survival 
Andrew Critchlow, The Telegraph Online, 21 September 2015 --The Government is being urged to bail out the threatened Redcar steel plant and save 2,000 jobs. After 160 years, steel making on Teesside is in danger of coming to a full stop. But the root cause of its demise lies in China, not the North. The potential HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" closure of the Redcar plant and the subsequent loss of 2,000 jobs will be a bitter blow for the region should the Government resist calls to bail out its Thai owners, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Sahaviriya Steel Industries, with a £100m emergency loan. Even if the Government did subsidise the plant, it’s unlikely that its long-term future would be guaranteed, as HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" China is increasingly dumping its vast stockpiles of steel . The demise of Redcar would raise doubts over whether the Teesside industry can survive. The region has been at the centre of British iron and steel production ever since industrial quantities of iron stone were first discovered in 1850 in the nearby Cleveland Hills. The North East was an incubator for steel and iron magnates such as Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, Sir Arthur John Dorman and Albert De Lande Long, who were behind the industry which underpinned Britain’s economic power in the late Victorian era. By the late 1870s, Britain led the world in metal production, accounting for almost 50pc of pig iron output and 40pc of the world’s steel. But HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" the subsequent gradual decline in the British steel industry accelerated after the privatisation of British Steel in the 1980s, when the Government refused to subsidise loss-making plants. “Government can’t do anything about the slowing economy in China or HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" the Chinese swamping our markets with steel at below market prices,” said Gareth Stace, managing director of UK Steel. “What government can do is support European initiatives looking into addressing these unfair trade practices.” Since its economy has started to cool, China has been infiltrating international markets with more of its low-cost offerings. Steel exports from China are said to have increased by 28pc to 43.5m tonnes in the first six months of this year, despite production falling by 2pc. To survive, Chinese steel mills are now selling overseas at a loss in order to maintain their production lines and to empty overstocked warehouses. Chinese imports were 2pc of UK steel demand in the first half of 2011, a figure expected to rise to 8pc this year. Britain’s steel makers also face headwinds from a strong pound, high energy costs, environmental levies and high business rates. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" Compared with China, Britain is now a minnow in terms of steel production . Chinese mills have an installed capacity of 1.1bn tonnes of metal per year, of which 340m tonnes is excess capacity. China’s crude steel production accounts for more than half of the world’s total. Its overcapacity alone is more than double the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union’s entire steel production of 170m tonnes. Demand growth for steel in Europe is also expected to slow this year after it picked up in 2014 along with the volume of imports, which now account for the majority of the UK’s supply. Across Europe, steel demand growth is expected to slow to just 1.5pc this year, which will add to pressure on the industry across the region. According to UK Steel, imports accounted for 60pc of market share last year – compared with 56pc in 2013 – as British manufacturers have struggled to retain market share. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Tata Steel UK, which owns the giant Port Talbot and Scunthorpe plants, posted a pre-tax loss of £768m in the year to the end of March, compared with a £354m loss last year. In July, the Indian company said that it would have to HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" lose over 700 jobs at its operations in Rotherham, in South Yorkshire, due to rising costs and competition from Asia. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Commission is investigating claims that both China and Russia are dumping unwanted steel on to Western markets, pushing many European metal smelters to the brink of bankruptcy. In June, 10 steel-making associations from across Europe and America issued a joint statement calling for action to stem the flow of Chinese metal. “There is a strong consensus against the rising tide of exports from state-owned, supported or controlled steel industries,” said the statement. “Looming over all of this is China, whose massive and increasing overcapacity in an era of slowing growth has already destabilised the global steel market and trade flows.” Despite concerns over the strength of the global market for steel, the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union saw a modest 3.9pc bounce in consumption last year. However, steel consumption remains around 25pc below the levels achieved in 2007 and doubts remain whether European states and institutions are willing to take on China in what could easily turn into a full-blown trade war to defend what many see as in industry in historical decline. In a statement to The Daily Telegraph, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Eurofer – the organisation that represents European steel producers – blamed China for causing the potential closure of Redcar. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Eurofer said: “Chinese import pressure and unfair trade practices are certainly [among] the root causes underlying the pressures that steel plants, such as Redcar, are facing. China now sells its excess steel to the EU market at prices that do not even cover its costs for raw materials and material transformation.” According to HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Eurofer, anti-dumping duties already imposed by the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Commission are the only things protecting many of the existing 330,000 European steel industry jobs. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Eurofer wants China denied market economy status (MES), which Beijing argues it is entitled to under the terms of its agreement to join the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation in 2001. The organisation fears that granting China market economy status would make it far harder for Europe to impose tariffs on cheap Chinese goods. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Eurofer said: “At present, China does not meet the MES criteria, a view echoed not only by the steel industry but also by many other manufacturing sectors. Were MES to be granted under current China’s non-market economy conditions, EU anti-dumping measures would no longer be effective because the EU would no longer be able to find real dumping margins on the exports of its artificially low-priced, subsidised steel products.” However, according to Mr Stace from UK Steel, it’s not just China that is to blame. The strength of the pound, which has appreciated especially against the euro over the past year, is making British steel exports uncompetitive in the European market and adding a potential £200m to the costs facing producers. Although the Government has ruled out subsidies for Redcar, there is a £130m package of state aid measures that has been proposed to offset the cost of meeting pollution targets currently awaiting EU approval. “The Government needs to secure state aid approval as soon as possible for the industry,” said Mr Stace. Another handicap facing British producers is the high cost of energy. Chinese steel mills benefit from cheap domestically-produced metallurgical coal and do not have to meet tough air pollution standards due here by 2020. “The industry is facing a crisis and needs help,” said Mr Stace. 
 
ASEAN, China, South Korea call for faster TFA approval
Xinhua , 2015-09-20 , Yi Xiaozhun attends the 12th China-ASEAN Expo, Sept. 18. --China, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Korea have called for faster approval of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) by WTO members. "WTO ratification will determine when this agreement comes into force," said Yi Xiaozhun, WTO deputy director general, at a symposium on trade to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of WTO on the sidelines of the 12th China-ASEAN Expo on Friday. With the agreement adopted, the focus has now shifted to respective capitals. The TFA was made in Bali in December 2013, the first multilateral trade agreement since the establishment of the WTO in 1995. The TFA will speed up the clearance of goods across borders, boost trade volumes and create millions of jobs. "The significance of the TFA lies in the fact that it will be a catalyst to revitalize sluggish global trade," said Moon Jae-do, South Korea's second vice minister of trade, industry and energy. Moon said the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) forecast that the agreement will boost global exports by over US$1 trillion, while the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects it could reduce worldwide trade costs by between 11% and 14%. However, the TFA will only enter into force when two-thirds of the WTO members formally accept the agreement. So far, only 16 of 108 members have accepted the protocol of the agreement, including China, Malaysia, Singapore South Korea. "China submitted the acceptance letter to the WTO on Sept. 4, which is an important move to push forward the implementation of TFA. China expects more WTO members to accept the agreement," said Wang Shouwen, Chinese vice minister of commerce. "The TFA will benefit trade and investment in the region and the world, and we intend to verify it before the MC10 in Kenya," said Sun Chanthol, Cambodia's commerce minister. Somchith Inthamith, deputy minister of industry and commerce of Laos, said the country has established a special committee to ratify the agreement as soon as possible and Indonesia is expected to approve the agreement before the end of the year. Forum attendees did say that a critical issue remains, that of how to raise the implementation capacity of developing countries, and in particular, least developed countries. Experience sharing could be an effective approach. The WTO also created a Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility to help ensure that developing countries receive the assistance needed to reap the full benefits of the TFA and to support its full implementation by all members.
 
Trade liberalisation for environmental goods necessary 
Vietnam News Agency Bulletin, 21 September 2015, Hanoi, September 21 (VNA) -Trade liberalisation for environmental goods and services has become the key to Vietnam's bilateral and multilateral negotiations, and international cooperation. Pham Minh Nguyen, director of the Institute of Trade Research, said the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO), the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" OECD), and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have been the leading international organisations to promote trade liberalisation of goods and services. In 2014, the world trade value for environmental goods and services reached 4 trillion USD, demonstrating a high growth rate. The value is expected to reach 10 trillion USD by 2020. The US took the lead in investment in goods and services, reporting an export turnover of 106 billion USD in 2013 and an annual growth rate of more than 8 percent. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union, China, and India followed. Nguyen told the Trade Liberalisation for Environment Goods and Services workshop, held recently in Hanoi, that the Vietnamese Government had passed several policies to enhance the development of environmental goods and services. In 2014, the market value for Vietnamese goods and services was 20 billion USD, accounting for 0.5 percent of the world total. Vietnam took the 33rd position in the top 50 environmental goods and services markets in the world. "Development is neither equal to the country's potential, nor local demand," he said, adding that Vietnam only focused on importing machines and technology from foreign countries. Imports accounted for over 80 percent of the market value. Production of goods and services in water and waste-treatment had yet to be developed. There were only 15 businesses operating in the environmental industry in Vietnam. He added that other countries had found it similarly difficult to promote trade liberalisation of environment goods and services as there was no global standard definition of goods and services. Tran Huy Hoan, a specialist from the European Trade Policy and Investment Support Project (EU-MUTRAP), agreed that Vietnam would have both opportunities and challenges in obtaining trade liberalisation in goods and services. Hoan said that liberalisation of goods and services could help the country expand its market, promote investment, reduce environmental protection costs, and create more jobs. Vietnam, however, did not have a list of environmental goods and services. Big initial investments and high technology requirements would increase competitiveness in the industry and make it difficult for domestic businesses to grow. Chu Van Giap from the Department of Science and Technology said that the environmental industry in Vietnam had only taken baby steps, with a modest number of businesses and limited capacity. The lack of policies and mechanisms for the industry's development had been one of the biggest barriers, Giap noted.
David Luff, a specialist from EU-MUTRAP, recently established a list of products which Vietnam could negotiate for reduced taxes or push its comparative advantage in the future./. 
 
The end of globalization? 
Editorial Board, Washington Post.com, 21 September 2015,  -- FEW SUBJECTS arouse more political passion, pro and con, than globalization. Yet as the debate rolls on, the phenomenon itself may be coming to an end: The seemingly limitless expansion of international trade that begin in the 1980s has slowed in recent years and may never recover its former momentum. Freshly released data from the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization and other economic forecasts show that the world is on course for its third consecutive year in which growth in global trade will be lower than overall economic growth, which is itself anemic, according to the Wall Street Journal. The last such three-year streak ended in 1985. In the quarter-century before the 2008 crash, by contrast, trade grew at an average 6 percent a year. Since the economic recovery began in 2010, the average trade growth rate has been stuck at 3 percent per year. These are sobering data for those of us who see globalization as a net plus, in both the United States and the rest of world. To be sure, increasing competition from other countries has caused large dislocations in U.S. industry. But the job losses and other costs have been offset by lower consumer prices and the rise of new, more efficient businesses. Meanwhile, economic growth made possible by trade has lifted literally hundreds of millions of people out of what was once desperate poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The question now is what, if anything, can be done to sustain and consolidate free trade so that it can continue to improve life for people around the world. The past three decades of rapid trade growth were probably always anomalous, because they reflected the linking of a huge, previously closed nation — China — to the world market. That low-hanging fruit has now been plucked; China's exports are shrinking and the country is in the midst of a difficult shift to growth driven more by consumption than investment. Future trade expansion, therefore, will depend more and more on the ability of leaders to maintain and modernize the institutional arrangements that support the free flow of goods and capital. Governments have so far mostly resisted protectionism despite the economic anxiety that persists half a decade after the Great Recession. Nevertheless, the main effort to update and strengthen global free trade, the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, is very much a work in progress, and opponents of globalization are fighting it as a last-ditch battle. Though President Obama has won congressional authorization to negotiate a TPP deal for expedited approval on Capitol Hill, which strengthened his hand at the bargaining table, the United States and its 11 negotiating partners are having a hard time getting to yes. The latest sticking point, which is to be discussed among officials this week in San Francisco, is Mexico and Canada's worry that the TPP will cede to Japan some of the access to the U.S. auto market that they gained under the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" North American Free Trade Agreement. The Obama administration must reach a compromise that the United States and these three close friends can live with, lest the world's best opportunity for sustaining free trade slip away.
 
Chinese official to U.S. companies: We hear your concerns 
Emily Rauhala, Washington Post.com, 21 September 2015, BEIJING — A senior Chinese trade official has a message for U.S. businesses operating in China: We hear your concerns, and we are trying our best. Oh, and we have some concerns of our own. In a rare interview granted in the run-up to President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Xi Jinping's visit to the United States, Zhang Xiangchen, China's deputy representative for international trade, shared his thoughts on the nature of U.S.-China trade relations, likening the ties to a boat and trade to the ballast that keeps things "sailing forward smoothly." Although there has been much talk about issues such as the South China Sea, cybertheft and the devaluation of the yuan in the lead-up to the visit — "drama, drama, drama," quipped HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" CNN — Zhang prefers to take a long view, noting that U.S.-China ties are much better now than they used to be, say, 10 or 20 years ago. With Xi in Seattle, the District, and New York over the next two weeks, Zhang said we can expect positive steps, including progress on state-province economic ties, cooperation on overseas development assistance and talk on a bilateral investment treaty — a potentially landmark agreement that would provide clearer rules for foreign investment. Zhang declined to comment on when such a deal might be made, noting only that China's entrance to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization took 15 years and that this treaty is "no less important or complex." Although Zhang was careful to emphasize "positive progress," — "positive" seems to be a key talking point for the carefully choreographed trip — he agreed that when it comes to commercial ties between the world's two largest economies, there are legitimate concerns on both sides. "As I often tell U.S. colleagues, good is not perfect," he said. To U.S. businesses in China, "not perfect" might feel like something of an understatement. U.S. companies that operate in the country have long complained that their success in the gargantuan Chinese market is undercut by policies that give local companies an advantage, whether by restricting foreign investment, subsidizing local firms or selective targeting in periodic compliance crackdowns. China's top leaders have vowed to let the market play a "decisive" role in the years ahead as part of their plan to "comprehensively deepen" economic reform. But the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) and others have raised doubts as to whether they are willing to loosen their grip, especially in light of this summer's stock crisis and the aggressive state intervention that followed.  Zhang said he spends a great deal of time listening to the concerns of the U.S. business community, whether by reading reports by the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the USCBC or by meeting with businesspeople. Topping their list of worries, he said, are questions of transparency, reasonableness of regulation and intellectual-property protection. "All these are issues that China meets in the process of its liberalization and opening up, and I also see that the concerns of [those] businesses are reasonable," he said. "It's our job to promote the improvement of China's investment environment," he continued. "And we believe that the Chinese government is a pro-business government, and the Chinese government welcomes foreign investment." And is China moving fast enough to reform and open its economy? "I think, historically speaking, we've been moving forward steadily," Zhang said. "If we look back after a few steps, maybe we will feel that we've been very quick and very bold." Other major areas of concern for U.S. businesses are China's new laws on national security and nongovernmental organizations, which many worry will give the country's sweeping security apparatus undue power over foreign firms. This summer, more than 40 U.S. trade associations and lobby groups, including the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to China's National People's Congress complaining that the NGO law could hamper their work. Zhang said those concerns are "reasonable" but are overblown and reflect a "lack of understanding." China's new national security law is "like a hanging sword which will only fall upon those that are engaged in activities that will undermine China's national security or social stability," he said. Besides, he added, China is not the first to implement a national security law and, indeed, in developing the law, "borrowed and learned heavily from international experience, including the U.S. experience." Asked about the concerns of Chinese investors and people in business in the United States, Zhang flipped the script, zooming in on how national security reviews in the United States have affected Chinese firms such as Huawei, one of the world's biggest makers of telecommunication equipment. The Chinese firm hoped to expand into the United States, but it faced strong opposition, with many U.S. voices noting that the company's founder, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Ren Zhengfei, was once in the People's Liberation Army. In 2012, a year-long House Intelligence Committee investigation into the company found that it was a threat to national security. Zhang dismissed the move as hypocrisy. U.S. firms in China are sometimes led by former ex-military types, he said. So Ren's PLA links are "irrelevant." 
 
Narendra Modi may seek the solar battery fix at Tesla 
Utpal Bhaskar, Mint, New Delhi, Sept. 21 -- When Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Narendra Modi visits HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Tesla Motors in Palo Alto in California this month, he may seek answers to the conundrum that has been confounding the Indian solar electricity planners for long-storage. Solar electricity can only be generated during day time, and to use it at night, an effective storage solution is required. India is fit for solar power generation given that the country receives solar radiation of 5 to 7kWh/m2 for 300 to 330 days in a year. With India unveiling the world's most ambitious solar power generation programme, the real game changer can be a cost-effective battery storage model for Indian conditions. With Tesla, headed by HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Elon Musk, already offering solutions such as Tesla Powerwall-a rechargeable lithium-ion battery designed to store energy at a residential level-Modi's itinerary fits with his government's plan of adding 100,000 MW of solar power by 2022. Of these, 40,000 MW each is planned from roof-top and distributed generation projects. The real problem for storage here are the costs. While Rs.5 per kWh tariff for solar electricity is the new norm in India, the Tesla Powerwall battery's "selling price to installers is $3500 for 10kWh and $3000 for 7kWh". This doesn't include the inverter and installation costs. According to Tesla, it "is not just an automotive company, it's an energy innovation company. Tesla Energy is a critical step in this mission to enable zero emission power generation. With Tesla Energy, Tesla is amplifying its efforts to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels to a sustainable energy future with Tesla batteries, enabling homes, business, and utilities to store sustainable and renewable energy." Modi will address a Renewable Energy Roundtable with HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" United States Department of Commerce and HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Stanford University on 26 September, the prime minister's office said in a statement on Sunday. Mint reported on 14 September about Modi's plan to take part in a roundtable discussion on green energy when he visits the US to attend the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" United Nations General Assembly in New York. The roundtable is being organized by the ministry of external affairs against the backdrop of a HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) panel's ruling against India in a dispute raised by the US over the country's solar power programme. Experts believe that Lithium-ion batteries are expected to be the leading technology for grid-connected, utility scale systems over the next two to three years, with the grid-connected battery energy storage system market expected to increase from $0.46 billion revenue in 2014 to reach $8.30 billion in 2024. "The grid-connected utility-scale battery storage market is expanding rapidly, driven by impressive technological breakthroughs and growth in manufacturing capabilities," consulting firm Frost & Sullivan said in an 18 September statement. Modi, who will be in the US during 24-29 September, is expected to speak at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN General Assembly in New York after which he will travel to Silicon Valley in California. He will address the Indian-American community at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" SAP Center in San Jose on 27 September. While in Silicon Valley, he is also expected to meet the heads of major technology companies. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has made energy security a key policy priority since taking office in May 2014. Its emphasis on solar and wind power is expected to strengthen India's standing at global climate change negotiations that culminate in the Paris summit. India's solar foray has caught the world's attention. Before the 2 October launch of its Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report, Paris-based HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" International Energy Agency (IEA) in a statement said, "Supported by policies aimed at enhancing energy security and sustainability, renewable power expanded at its fastest rate to date in 2014 and now represents more than 45% of overall supply additions. Deployment continues to shift towards energy-hungry emerging markets, and some countries, such as China and India, have bolstered ambitions." In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for only 13%, or 36,471 MW, of India's total installed power capacity of 2,75,912 MW.

As UN meets to fight poverty, Europe puts up razor wire to keep poor out 
Larry Elliott Economics editor, The Guardian, 21 September 2015 02:00 -- Sustainable development summit must address inequality that makes people undertake dangerous journeys to the west
The contrast could hardly be sharper. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" Razor wire fences are being constructed to keep the uprooted poor out of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union at the very moment the United Nations meets to agree anti-poverty goals for the next 15 years. No question, the gathering in New York will be a regular jamboree. There will be mutual backslapping about the progress that has been made over the past 15 years, a good deal of it justified. Countries will solemnly pledge to meet the 17 HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" sustainable development goals, with 169 specific targets, by 2030. They will turn a blind eye to what is happening in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia and Austria.
The truth, though, is that there is a link between the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN shindig and the most severe refugee crisis in generations: inequality. It is the obvious disparity between life in a rich country and life in a poor country that makes the long and dangerous journey to the west attractive. It is the gap between rich and poor within developed countries that has helped foster a deep suspicion, not just of unlimited migration, but of free movement of capital and goods as well. And without addressing inequality head on, ensuring that growth benefits the poor by as much as it benefits the rich, there is not the remotest chance that the ambitious goals being embraced in New York this week will be met. Here’s the picture. The SDGs replace the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" millennium development goals that set the framework for poverty reduction between 2000 and 2015, but are much tougher. The MDGs sought to make progress in areas such as poverty reduction or infant mortality: the SDGs will commit the international community to more ambitious goals, which include ending poverty and hunger, and ensuring healthy lives and access to quality education for all. There are reasons to be optimistic. Much progress has been made in the past two decades, in large part due to the rapid growth in China. One billion people have been lifted out of poverty and the MDG objective of halving the number living below the global agreed minimum was achieved five years early. This will be seen by world leaders as evidence that even more can be done in the next 15 years. But achieving the new SDGs would be a gargantuan task in the best of times. And these are not the best of times. China is growing more slowly, with concerns that HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" doctored official figures mask a hard landing. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" Emerging markets in the rest of the world are being hurt both by weaker Chinese demand for their commodities and by the continued sluggishness of the big western economies. The Great Recession of 2008-09 continues to cast a long shadow. The changing mood has resulted in a less generous approach to aid, where the donor community has been cutting assistance in real terms in response to domestic financial pressures.
It is also clear that the tide of globalisation has ebbed since its high point in the 1990s. Two decades ago, the public in the west could see the benefits of breaking down barriers: it meant cheaper manufactured goods from China and other developing countries, which pushed down the cost of living and raised disposable incomes. But globalisation also meant free movement of capital, which allowed the banks to take the risks that led to the meltdown of 2007, and has encouraged people from poorer countries to seek a better life in the west. These aspects of globalisation have proved much less popular. The physical barriers to free movement of people being constructed on the southern borders of the EU are merely the physical manifestation of a wider set of measures aimed at controlling the free movement of capital, labour and goods. These include ring-fencing the retail and investment operations of banks, the decision by a number of eurozone governments to adopt a financial transactions tax, and the introduction of capital controls by countries faced by bank runs. There has not been a multilateral trade agreement since 1993 and the ministerial meeting of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation in Kenya in December looks like being a sombre affair. After 14 years of wrangling, the chances are that the meeting will administer the last rites to the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks. The continued impasse at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO has prompted countries to try an alternative route: bilateral deals or agreements involving a number of willing participants. These have not been without their problems either: there has been widespread public opposition in Europe to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), mainly due to fears that it would allow multinational companies to use a body for settling disputes to undermine the power of governments to act in what they consider to be the best interests of their citizens.
Rising inequality explains the growing hostility to calls from business lobbies to do a TTIP deal or from free-market think tanks for countries to open their borders to people from developing countries seeking work. The benefits of globalisation have been unfairly skewed towards a privileged elite, a trend that leads to lower global growth according to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" International Monetary Fund. Work by the UK Overseas Development Institute has shown that the progress made towards poverty reduction in developing countries would have been even more rapid had the poor not, in many cases, been left behind. The think tank has calculated that an additional 700 million people would have escaped poverty between 1990 and 2010 had the incomes of the poorest 40% grown by two percentage points faster than the average. The evidence is that those countries, such as Guinea, where incomes of the poor did rise by more than the average, saw bigger reductions in poverty. Inequality also threatens the SDG for healthcare, where the lack of access to universal antenatal care means progress has been slow in reducing the number of children dying in the first days and weeks of their lives. The rich in developing countries are well looked after; the poor are not. The message is clear. Governments in both developed and developing countries have to embrace the idea of pro-poor growth. Oxfam says action is needed in three key areas: fair tax rules that ensure that all players – including the rich and multinational companies – pay their fair share; the investment of the missing tax billions in better public services; and secure, well-paid jobs for men and women that allow them to work their way out of poverty.
A good start would be for this week’s HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN conference to set intermediate targets for reducing inequality for 2020 and 2025. Why? Because without such a commitment, the backlash against globalisation will intensify, the flows of desperate people leaving developing countries will continue to increase, the razor wire will continue to be rolled out, and the world will be a poorer place. 
 
China renews push for market economy status; Trade policy 
ByTom Mitchell in Beijing, Financial Times, 21 September 2015 -  Beijing is accelerating its push for HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation market economy status (MES) despite growing international criticism that it has backed away from difficult economic reforms. China's moves to devalue the renminbi and bail out its stock market, among other steps, have raised concerns that it is backtracking from efforts to give a freer reign to market forces. Undeterred, the renewed drive for the coveted MES comes ahead of upcoming summit meetings with four of its largest trading partners, according to people familiar with the discussions. A provision in China's HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO accession agreement that allows other countries to treat it as a non-market economy will expire in December 2016, potentially requiring the EU to begin drafting new trade legislation by the end of this year. "For China, market economy status is a matter of prestige," said one Beijing-based diplomat. "For us, it's a political decision to take." Granting Beijing MES would make it easier for Chinese companies targeted in HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO anti-dumping cases to defend themselves, leading some to warn of "disastrous consequences" for the EU and US. The ramping up of talks comes as President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Xi Jinping leaves this week for his first official state visit to the US and is scheduled to visit the UK in October. Premier HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Li Keqiang will meet senior EU leaders in Beijing at the end of the month and also host German Chancellor HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Angela Merkel later in the year. While Beijing argues that MES should be extended automatically in December 2016 under the terms of its HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO accession agreement, other trade experts argue that the agreement instead requires Chinese exporters to prove first that they do not benefit from government subsidies and currency policy. "We will definitely hear more about MES in coming days and weeks," said one person briefed on China's US and EU trade talks. "But I would be surprised if the US would grant it to China, especially with next year's presidential election." Beijing is an easy target for candidates in the crowded US presidential election field. In a paper commissioned by European business organisations, the Washington-based HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Economic Policy Institute argued that MES status would lead to a surge in Chinese exports, eliminating up to 1.6m manufacturing jobs in the EU. "China has extensively subsidised a range of industries and used currency manipulation to support production and exports, allowing it to accumulate widespread gluts of goods that it can export at discount prices," said HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Robert Scott, EPI's trade research director. "Granting market economy status to China would harm producers of these goods in the EU, US and other countries by exposing them to a flood of cheap Chinese products."
 
'Made in China' not an easy label to wear 
ByWu Changqi, China Daily-Hong Kong Edition, 21 September 2015 - Some time ago, the term "Made in China" seemed to be out of fashion. Some in the academic circle, as well as policymakers, were calling to replace the term with "Invented in China". I often wonder what's actually wrong with Made in China, as China is the manufacturing center of world. So, for me, the State Council's recent policy circular on the "Made in China 2025" is a big relief. It's an important document outlining the development direction for China's manufacturing industry during the next 10 years and beyond, and dispels doubt over the future of the industry. Made in China will live on for many years to come. To understand the significance of that document, we had better take a retrospective view on the evolution of China's manufacturing industry in the recent past. China's current status as the center of global manufacturing did not come easy. It has gone through several stages. In the early years of economic reform and opening-up, China's almost unlimited supply of unskilled labor, with little exposure to market competition, made China the fertile land of process manufacturing and trade, and an ideal location for outsourcing by multinational enterprises from industrialized nations. I consider the first 24 years of China's economic reform as the first stage of Made in China. That period was characterized by a combination of international capital and technology flow, and China's abundant labor supply. Throughout that period, a large number of entrepreneurs and workers learned the skills of modern manufacturing in a market environment, and ways to conduct business. As a result, that created numerous large, indigenous companies looking for markets. The growth of these companies accelerated and they were eventually tested in the global market when China joined the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization in 2001, which is when Made in China entered phase two.
With China fully integrating into the global economy, the country's comparative advantage of abundant labor resources was fully utilized and highlighted the international competitiveness of China's manufacturers. In the subsequent 15 years, the country became the world's factory. During that process, China built up a large pool of skilled workers to support its manufacturing industry. The nation also developed its extensive infrastructure and logistic systems over a short period of time. Although China runs a deficit in services trade, its trade in manufactured goods still runs a large surplus. Ironically, the success of China's manufacturing industry has created its own challenges. As manufacturing activities expanded and served the entire world, natural and human resources became stretched. As the cost of labor has risen, combined with the rapid growth of GDP per capita and an aging population, the conventional mode of manufacturing is not sustainable. The continuous improvement in productivity has slowed the pressure on costs, but wage expectations and an increase in the education level has pushed up salaries, which in turn has steadily pushed up labor costs. The Made in China 2025 strategy draws a blueprint for Chinese manufacturing in the future. As technological innovation accelerates, a number of interruptive innovations will emerge, and China as a whole must brace for the challenges that technological innovation and globalization will bring. That will mark the start of "Made in China 3.0". Innovation lies at the core of Made in China 2025, and the strategy demands deep integration with cutting-edge technology, in particular integrating with data and information technologies. Another feature is its inclusiveness. As China moves higher up the value chain, labor-intensive activities will be relocated to neighboring countries such as Vietnam where GDP per capita is substantially lower. That will release more resources in China for more value-added activities and create jobs for the host countries. The development through Made in China 2025 must also balance the economic development of different regions in China, as the level of economic development and salaries levels vary. The strategy is the third stage of China's long march toward industrialization. It highlights key industries, as well as possible developments in China's manufacturing industry beyond 2025 to 2050, when the country will be a powerhouse of global manufacturing. Implementing Made in China 2025 will not be easy, as there will be challenges as well as opportunities.

3,5 millions d’emplois européens menacés si la Chine change de statut à l’OMC fin 2016 
Agence Ecofin - samedi, 19 septembre 2015 -- Selon l'Economic Policy Institute (EPI), l'octroi à la Chine du statut d'économie de marché pourrait mettre en péril jusqu'à 3,5 millions d'emplois dans l'Union européenne. 
Selon Robert E. Scott, qui a dirigé l'étude, si l’Europe accorde à la Chine le statut d’économie de marché qu’elle revendique, les exportations chinoises vers l’Europe augmenteront alors de 25 à 50% par année : « En abandonnant la possibilité de remédier aux distorsions de concurrence résultant de dumping financé par un Etat, les producteurs européens s'exposeraient à un afflux de produits bon marché en provenance de Chine, ce qui provoquerait une destruction de l'emploi et de l'investissement des entreprises manufacturières.» AEGIS Europe, qui regroupe une trentaine d’associations patronales, tire la sonnette d’alarme : « Le statut d'économie de marché rendrait caduques environ 50 mesures anti-dumping d'une importance vitale, actuellement en vigueur au sein de l'UE. La Chine serait en mesure d'étendre sa stratégie de dumping dans l'ensemble des secteurs manufacturiers européens, » affirme Milan Nitzschke, porte-parole du groupement des industriels. Un point de vue partagé par le groupement européen de centrales syndicales Industriall.
