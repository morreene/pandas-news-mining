Regional trade associations are moving to forefront against background of stalling WTO - PM Medvedev 
ITAR-TASS World Service, 23 September 2015 20:08, Regional trade associations are moving to forefront against background of stalling HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO - PM Medvedev
MOSCOW, September 23. /TASS/. Regional trade associations of countries are moving to the forefront against the background of stalling HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization, Russian Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday in the article published by Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper.
The new globalization model is formed along with the relevant new protectionism model, the Russian Prime Minister said. "Regional (interstate) free trade associations are coming to the forefront, making possible to resolve questions stalled within the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO framework for decades," Medvedev added.
"Dynamics of forex rates is becoming a stronger tool of markets protection than customs tariffs," the prime minister said. "Protection of added value chains generated by the national business is turning into a priority interest of the state instead of protecting its customs territory," Medvedev said. 
 
Sino-US Bilateral Investment Treaty to boost economic relations
By Zhu Qiwen(chinadaily.com.cn), 2015-09-24 -- Negotiations on the China-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty will make up most of the discussions during President Xi Jinping's forthcoming state visit to the US, the Ministry of Commerce said on Sept 16, 2015.

A high-standard Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) is essential for China and the US to emerge in a stronger economic relationship and steer away from the current global slowdown. Only hours upon his arrival to the US on September 22, Chinese President Xi Jinping called that the two countries must conclude a high-quality agreement as soon as possible. This explicit sense of urgency is well justified by not only the massive economic challenges faced by countries, but also the enormous benefits from cross-border investment for the world's two largest economies. China's entry into the World Trade Organization had remarkably expedited the country's rise as a global trading power creating millions of new jobs for Chinese workers all while lowering prices for billions of consumers around the world. The bilateral trade volume that soared from around $100 billion USD in 2000 to $555 billion USD in 2014 speaks volume of the vital role trade has played in stabilizing economic ties between China and the US. However, as the expansion of the Chinese economy slows down, it becomes increasingly obvious that another driving force other than trade is badly needed to sustain economic growth at home. Sitting on a foreign exchange reserve of more than $3 trillion USD, China has gradually developed a keen interest in deploying some of its industrial prowess in overseas markets. As a matter of fact, a large part of China's outbound investment, which exceeded $100 billion USD for the first time in 2014, had gone to infrastructure projects in developing countries. Yet, as more and more Chinese enterprises seek to globalize, they are eager to get equal investment access to those developed economies. It is reported that China's direct investment in the US soared by 9 folds in the past five years. By the end of 2014, Chinese enterprises have invested $46 billion USD in the US while employing more than 80,000 full-time American employees, according to a study sponsored by the National Committee on US-China Relations and done by US research firm Rhodium Group LLC.  The growth momentum of Chinese investment in the US is surely impressive, but the total remains fairly inadequate in view of the sheer size of the two economies. Both US and China's GDP stand above the $10 trillion USD mark. The number of Chinese companies subject to US reviews for national security reasons is disproportionately high in spite of China's relatively small investment scale in the US. Under such circumstances, Chinese policymakers recognized one obvious merit for a high quality BIT is reduction of restraints Chinese firms face when investing on US soil. A series of far-reaching reforms concerning State-owned enterprises as well as adoption of a negative list for investment have been rolled out to accelerate the country's ongoing economic transformation. For the US, the benefits of a high-standard BIT will include jobs from which Chinese investment will create and greater opportunities for US companies to tap into the service sectors in China. China's service sector currently accounts for about half of its gross domestic product while the US' accounts for 80 percent. Since a booming service sector is crucial to China's economic transition toward consumption-led growth, US investors are poised to win in providing world-class services in China. These mutual benefits of a BIT deal do not deny the difficulties of the give-and-take course of action in negotiations. They are, however, a compelling reason as to why the two countries should encourage each other as much as possible in cross-border investments to cement the economic ties.
 
Canada heads to TPP talks in Atlanta with key auto content issue unresolved; Trade Minister Ed Fast says country can’t afford to walk away from Trans-Pacific Partnership talks ahead of election, despite disagreements with Japan over auto sector rules 
Steven Chase, The Globe and Mail (Breaking News), 23 September 2015, OTTAWA --Canada’s Trade Minister Ed Fast is heading to Atlanta to join a pivotal round of talks that could yield a massive Pacific Rim trade deal – even though Japan has so far refused to give ground on rules in the proposed accord that could hurt Canada’s auto sector. The very same unreconciled differences between Canada and Mexico on one hand, and Japan on the other, stalled a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord last summer in Maui. Mr. Fast says Canada can’t afford to walk away from the table – even during an election campaign with less than four weeks before the vote. A successful conclusion to the talks, of course, could be a political boon for the Tories. Twelve countries, from Chile to Vietnam, are part of efforts to create a sprawling free trade zone comprising 40 per cent of annual global economic output. Canada and Mexico, however, are challenging provisions agreed to by the United States and Japan that would allow cars and auto parts to be sold in North America with significantly less domestic-content requirements than exist under HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" NAFTA. Negotiations this week in San Francisco to break this auto-trade logjam ended without resolution. Canadian officials privately point fingers at Tokyo. “Talks have been difficult, and there is still much progress to be made,” a HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Canadian government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Japan has moved in the right direction, but they’re moving inches and we need them to move yards.” The United States and Japan, the two most influential players in the TPP talks, are eager to wrap up a deal before the Canadian federal election on Oct. 19. One of the reasons cited by Japan is the possibility that the Harper Conservatives might lose power, and a new government might be less willing to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership on an expedited basis. Japan’s minister responsible for the TPP, Akira Amari, warned last Friday that failure to reach a deal in Atlanta could delay an agreement for years. On Wednesday, Mr. Fast defended his decision to join the talks in Atlanta even though Canada has not resolved the very problem that prompted Canadian negotiators to balk at a deal in Hawaii. Chief negotiators begin talks in Atlanta on Friday, and trade ministers from 12 countries join them in the middle of next week. Under HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" NAFTA, Canada, the United States and Mexico require more than 60 per cent of cars and auto parts to be made within the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" NAFTA zone in order to enter their markets tariff-free. The Japan-U.S. formula says that in the TPP zone, vehicles would be tariff-free even if only 45 per cent of their content is made within the TPP zone, and auto parts with as little as 30 per cent. Canada’s auto parts manufacturers, who employ more than 80,000 in Canada, are calling on Ottawa to secure a 50-per-cent content rule for cars and parts. Rick Roth, a spokesman for Mr. Fast’s office, said Canada wants a TPP deal that benefits all sectors “and ensures the interests of Canadian auto makers and parts makers are well served.” Mr. Fast said allowing the TPP to proceed without Canada would mean being cut out of a huge new trade network. It would mean forgoing new market opportunities in Asia, and Canada’s preferential relationship with the United States under HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" NAFTA would be eroded over time as the Trans-Pacific Partnership deepened ties between the Americans and 10 other Pacific Rim countries. “If we walk away now, there’s a tremendous cost that our economy will pay,” Mr. Fast told CBC TV. Conservative Leader Stephen Harper would certainly tout a TPP deal as the fruit of his government’s economic policy, but Mr. Fast rejected the notion that Ottawa is at the talks in order to win votes. “By no means is the fact that we’re at the table today a political gesture.” New Zealand’s trade minister praised the Harper government’s willingness to hammer out a trade deal during an election campaign – a period when Ottawa is run in caretaker mode until a new government is elected. “The Canadians are negotiating as if there’s no election,” Tim Groser told New Zealand media on Tuesday. Mr. Groser nevertheless signalled he remains unhappy with the lack of ambition on liberalizing the trade in dairy products, a sign that bigger players in the TPP talks may have relented in their push for Canada to massively open its markets to foreign milk and cheese. He predicted a TPP accord would not be a “gold-plated deal” as far as he is concerned. “Basically, the situation is that I and my negotiators can see a very good deal for New Zealand in everything except dairy, and I don’t know to characterize the deal there because it’s not a deal we could accept,” Mr. Groser said, according to the New Zealand Herald. He appeared resigned, saying what is taking shape may be the best that can be achieved. “Is there a better alternative? Successive governments have tried to do bilateral [free-trade agreements]with Canada, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. for 30 years and have completely failed,” Mr. Groser said. “With these four giant countries, it’s this or nothing.” 
 
Groser: Dairy still stumbling block 
Pattrick Smellie, Hawke's Bay Today, 24 September 2015 -- New Zealand negotiators are “holding our ground” in talks to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade and investment treaty, with some improved access expected for dairy exports to the highly protected markets of North America and Japan, says Trade Minister Tim Groser. He acknowledged comments from Prime Minister John Key on Monday, that whatever deal was achieved would be “at least the very best we can do”, had been interpreted as a sign of a poor deal on dairy in the offing, but told BusinessDesk: “We’re in anything other than capitulation mode.” It would, however, “not be a gold-plated deal”. “Basically, the situation is that I and my negotiators can see a very good deal for New Zealand in everything except dairy, and I don’t know to characterise the deal there because it’s not a deal we could accept,” said Groser. The minister has yet to commit to attend a proposed new round of ministerial negotiations in the US next week, although he is due in New York for climate change talks in the next few days. He said: “You might say ‘well how can New Zealand hold out?’ Well, we are. We will try and get the absolute best possible deal. It will not be a gold-plated deal.” “Is there a better alternative? Successive governments have tried to do bilateral FTAs [free-trade agreements] with Canada, Japan, Mexico and the US for 30 years and have completely failed,” said Groser. “With these four giant countries, it’s this or nothing.” However, timing for a conclusion to the 12-nation pact may not be in the next fortnight. “It depends whether negotiators are prepared to search for some genuine common ground, rather than this game of chicken that’s going on,” Groser said. “I’m just not quite sure we’ll get a deal in the next two weeks or the next two months. I’m suggesting to the Prime Minister we talk about before the end of the year. “We’ve got to avoid slipping into next year and into the middle of the US presidential election campaign, where trade is such a difficult issue,” he said. While the success of any international negotiation could never be guaranteed, the amount of political capital invested in TPP by the 12 negotiating countries, and especially US President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Barack Obama, and the existence of a “very mature text” meant a successful conclusion was a 90 per cent likelihood. “Landing zones are clear right across the text in all but three areas,” said Groser, citing market access for automobiles and dairy, and patent extensions for biologic pharmaceuticals the outstanding areas. 
 
African designers make business case for ethical fashion 
Middle East North Africa Financial Network (MENAFN), 24 September 2015,  (MENAFN - AFP) South Africa's Sindiso Khumalo hopes you like the fact that her clothes are made in Cape Town and "sweatshop free".
But most of all, the London-based designer hopes you want to buy them because you love wearing the signature graphic prints inspired-by and made in her homeland. "I think people should buy into my stuff because it is good, not just because it is African," she told AFP in Milan, where she is one of four designers with roots on the continent showcasing their Spring/Summer 2016 collection during the city's latest fashion week. "That is how myself and all of the designers here like to think of ourselves. We are designers first and then we are Africans," Khumalo says. "I am a woman, a mother. I'm all of these things. "But people should buy into my brand because they like the stuff and it is good quality. Bonus that it is African!" Khumalo is in Milan looking to make contacts and find new buyers thanks to the latest stage of an initiative aimed at forging a mutually-beneficial, non-exploitative connection between the world of high fashion and highly-skilled but often isolated and impoverished craftsmen and women in the developing world. The Ethical Fashion Initiative, a programme run by the Geneva-based HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" International Trade Centre (ITC), has already helped some 20 top designers including Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to source original textiles, jewellery and other accessories in several African countries and in Haiti. A joint agency of the United Nations and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization, the ITC also seeks to mentor up-and-coming designers rooted in those countries in a bid to advance its goal of making the global fashion business a little fairer. - 'Exquisite work' - American-Ghanaian Mimi Plange has already had her designs utilising African-inspired leather quilting and embroidered prints worn by Michelle Obama, Rihanna and Serena Williams. And she jumped at the chance to join Khumalo, South African menswear designer Laduma Ngxokolo and Senegal-born/New York-raised Sophie Zinga in presenting their work through the long-established Milanese style emporium Biffi Boutique. "This is an opportunity any designer would kill for," she said. Plange says the emergence of a generation of African designers committed to sourcing their materials on the continent can help secure a brighter future for many of the region's artisans while helping the top end of fashion retain the hand-made quality and meticulous attention to detail that created its special aura. "All this embroidery and beading and things that are done by hand ... it is a lost craft in the Western world now," Plange said. "Everybody wants everything really fast and they want it now. "But when you look at couture and you look at high-end fashion, you see how important it is to have these ateliers with these artisans. "You can only have that exquisite work when it is done by hand and it is done in a slow way with a lot of meaning and thought." Laduma is seeking to boost the profile of his knitwear featuring modern patterns based on the traditional beadwork of South Africa's Xhosa, a range he initially developed with the aim of selling it to men going through the tribe's manhood initiation. "It is about creating brand awareness, getting buyers familiar with my product feel, touch and telling them how it is made and what inspires it," he told AFP. - 'Mountain of African talent' - Simone Cipriani, founder and head of the Ethical Fashion Initiative, describes it as a project born of twin desires to "bring authenticity back to fashion and bring work to Africa". But this altruistic goal was always founded on a hard-headed business model that is reflected in the attitude of the African designers in Milan this week, he says. "I saw the ethical-led segment of fashion coming up and saw the segment of responsible fashion coming up. Nobody was in there," he said. Other initiatives have followed Ethical Fashion's lead, but Cipriani believes there is still much more that can be done. "I would like to have many more people involved in this, many more artisans all over Africa, many more designers. "I'd like to see the whole fashion sector change. I'm not sure I am going to see that in my life but you have got have an objective and a horizon to work towards. "There is a mountain of talent in Africa. When I was young, Italy was about creativity and artisans. Today Africa is the same." 
 
Granting Market Economy Status to China Would Eliminate Millions of EU Jobs 
Sputnik News Service, 23 September 2015 14:04 -- The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union and other members of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) are currently considering granting market economy status (MES) to China.
The move is expected to fundamentally change the way EU countries handle dumped exports under the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO rules, according to a study published by HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Economic Policy Institute. In 2001, China joined the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO as a "nonmarket economy" under the terms of its Protocol of Accession allowing other HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO members to apply anti-dumping measures, including embargo, against China. With MES status, China could avoid enforcement of anti-dumping laws in the EU, US and other countries, the report read. In addition, granting MES to China would eliminate the threat that duties could be imposed on tens of thousands if China-made products which would allow Chinese exporters to lower prices without fear of anti-dumping complaints. According to the report, if EU decided to grant MES to China this "would put between 1.7 million and 3.5 million EU jobs at risk by curbing the ability to impose tariffs on dumped goods and thus allowing Chinese companies to undercut domestic production by flooding the EU with cheap goods." Over the last 15 years, EU imports from China increased nearly fivefold, from €74.6 billion in 2000 to €359.6 billion in 2015. According to the calculations, the increased imports of cheaper China-manufactured goods to the European market would reduce EU domestic output by between €114.1 billion and €228 billion a year that would lead to 1.7-3.5 million potential jobs lost. In addition, granting MES to China would also put up to 2.7 million direct jobs at risk in a number of import-sensitive industries. Granting MES to China would affect the EU economy in several ways, according to the study. It would increase EU imports of manufactured commodities by €71.3-142.5 billion, or more thus increasing EU trade deficits and reducing its GDP by one-two percent. This would eliminate 1.7-3.5 million EU jobs in three years after MES is granted. It would also put 478,600 to 957.300 jobs directly at risk due to increased imports from China. What is more, between 779,000 and 1.6 million jobs in manufacturing would be potentially eliminated, the largest number of job at risk of any major industry. The largest potential losses would be in the textile and apparel-making industries, as well as in computer, electronic and optical products. Outside manufacturing industries, significant losses are expected in retail trade; public, social and related services. The move would create the biggest number of potential job losses in the four largest European economies - Germany, the UK, Italy and France. It would also have the biggest impact, in terms of the number of jobs at risk as a share of total employment, in 10 countries in Central Europe, including Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Finally, it would put an additional 2.7 million workers of highly vulnerable industries at risk, including motor vehicle parts, paper products, ceramics, glass, and additional jobs in other industries as chemicals and solar cells. To sum up, the increase of Chinese imports to the EU market will have a depressing effect on business and investments in Europe as well as seriously affect its social stability, the authors of the study warned. 
 
Agriculture sector faces tough times ahead
VietNamNet Bridge, 24 September 2015 – Experts of the Institute for Policy and Strategy of Agriculture and Rural Development (IPSARD) have warned that Vietnam’s agricultural sector will continue to face tough times ahead due to fiercer competition and oversupply on global markets.
Speaking at a seminar on the impact of global developments on agriculture in Vietnam in Hanoi on Wednesday, IPSARD director Nguyen Do Anh Tuan said falling farm produce exports were attributable to the falls of regional currencies against the U.S. dollar which had put Vietnam in a disadvantageous position when exporting agro-aqua-forestry products. In terms of price, Vietnam has seen the competitiveness of its rice falling compared to that of India and Thailand; coffee to Brazil and Colombia; shrimp to Thailand, India and Indonesia; and rubber to Indonesia and Malaysia.  Unfavorable economic developments on global markets, especially those in China recently, have hit Vietnam’s agricultural trade as 20% of Vietnamese farm products are sold to the northern neighbor. This percentage does not include exports made via small border gates. Tuan gave an example that in the first seven months of this year, China imported 37% of total Vietnamese rice export volume, 47% of rubber products, 36% of fruits and vegetables, 13% of wooden products, 12% of cashew nuts and 7% of seafood. Nguyen Trung Kien, acting head of the commodity markets division at IPSARD, said Vietnam’s agricultural growth relies heavily on export markets and described the farm export picture as bleak. Outbound sales of farm produce in the first eight months of this year totaled US$9.2 billion, down 7.7% year-on-year. Kien said the competitiveness of Vietnamese farm products has declined significantly compared to that of regional rivals. For instance, export prices of Vietnam’s 25% and 5% broken rice were lower than those of Thailand and India before but they are now almost equal due to the impact of monetary policies in Vietnam and other regional countries, especially after China’s strong devaluation of the yuan. Vietnamese rice accounted for 66% of China’s total import of the commodity in 2013 but the proportion dropped to 47% in the first four months of this year as the northern neighbor increased imports from Thailand and Cambodia. The price of Arabica coffee in Brazil and Colombia has fallen sharply due to the strong depreciation of their currencies, piling pressure on Vietnam’s Robusta coffee exports. Kien said importers prefer Arabica coffee and have increased purchases of this commodity when the gap between its price and that of Robusta coffee has been narrowed. Rubber prices are in a downtrend due to weak demand of China and oversupply on the world market. Moreover, more producers have switched to using synthetic rubber rather than natural one because of lower prices as a result of the world oil price plunge. Seafood is in the same boat as the export price of Vietnamese shrimp is higher than that offered by exporters in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Therefore, Kien said price competition is one of the main problems with Vietnam’s agro-aqua-forestry exports and global demand for these products is unpredictable because the chance of a strong recovery of the world’s economy is low. According to projections of the world’s major analysis organizations, prices of farm products like rice, coffee and shrimp could fall by 7-13% until 2020 compared to 2015. However, the price of rubber products is forecast to rise slightly. IPSARD suggested that Vietnam should step up shipments of seafood, coffee, cashew nut, pepper and furniture to the United States to cash in on a firmer dollar against the local currency. At the same time, domestic enterprises need to find ways to boost sales of fruits, vegetables, rubber, cashew, wooden products and shrimp to China via official channels. As for rice, the institute called for domestic enterprises to seek to secure export contracts with Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia as these countries are forecast to import more rice this year. In the long term, Kien proposed the Government support local enterprises to diversify export markets and ship rice to Ivory Coast, Ghana, the U.S., Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates; coffee to South Korea, Ireland, Russia, Australia and Thailand; and rubber to Ireland and Turkey.
 
Guimaras mango exports eyed (DTI official suggests geographic indication for crop) 
Louine Hope Conserva, BusinessWorld, 24 September 2015,  ILOILO CITY - Fresh and processed mangoes from Guimaras are eyed as an export product by the Department of Trade Industry (DTI) given the province's ample production."Guimaras has lots of mangoes. In fact, I hope, some quantity would be enough to export," said Senen M. Perlada, director of the DTI Export Marketing Bureau. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority show the province produced 9,194 metric tons of mango in 2012. Mr. Perlada said the island province can position itself as a mango exporter to the United States. "With mangoes, we can do a geographic [indication], and you have the right to do that. There is also an opportunity for the province to go organic considering its natural boundary," he said. A geographic indication (GI) is a sign on products with a specific geographic origin and whose qualities or reputation are due to that origin, according to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Intellectual Property Organization. Examples of products with GIs are Tequila and Roquefort cheese. Guimaras mangoes are well-known but are not sold under an official GI. The National Mango Research and Development Center under the Department of Agriculture - HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Bureau of Plant Industry is based in Guimaras. There are existing operators on the island, Mr. Perlada also said, that are ready to send their products out to the foreign markets. "There are a few in Guimaras that are qualified as export-ready, so we have seminars on a regional integrated platform for exporters," he said. Cashew is another agricultural commodity that the province can develop for export, he added. DTI Undersecretary Zenaida C. Maglaya, meanwhile, said the agency will be working through its Guimaras provincial office towards these export goals. "When you have the volume, you can export. It is more of peculiarity or something unique in a product. Identify what your strengths are," Ms. Maglaya said. She added that the agency is also looking at simplifying business procedures and processes - including food certification - for micro, small, and medium enterprises. "We are working with the Food and Drugs Administration [regarding] if they could simplify their requirements for licenses to operate for our micro- entrepreneurs to start a food processing business," she said.
