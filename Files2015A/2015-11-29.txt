Pope Calls for Inclusive Policies at WTO Meet 
All Africa, Nov 28, 2015 (The Star/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- POPE Francis rallied policymakers to seek a lasting treaty to tackle inequity and exclusion in global trade at the forthcoming World Trade Organisation's 10th ministerial conference in Nairobi. Speaking at the United Nation's Complex on Thursday, the Pope revisited an appeal he said had earlier been made by Pope Paul VI in 1967. Pope Paul VI, the pontiff told UN staff at Nairobi office, foresaw the present globalisation where countries have become interdependent. "While recognising that much has been done in this area, it seems that we have yet to attain an international system of commerce which is equitable and completely at the service of the battle against poverty and exclusion," the Holy Father said. "It is my hope that the deliberations of the forthcoming Nairobi Conference will not be a simple balancing of conflicting interests, but a genuine service to care of our common home and the integral development of persons, especially those in greatest need." Nairobi will be hosting the ministerial conference, WTO's top decision making organ, between December 15 and 18. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed will chair the meeting which is held after every two years. Amina has made it clear East African Community will seek to push for liberalisation of trade in services as well as a resolution on long-standing impasse over agricultural subsidies in developed countries. The Geneva-based WTO has failed to agree on a worldwide package of trade reforms to remove trade barriers following Doha meeting in 2001. WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo said on Thursday the talks are deadlocked ahead of Nairobi's forum, Reuters reported. "We clearly are stuck in the negotiations at this point in time," Azevedo told a news conference. "I think it will be very difficult to reconcile the views. I would say impossible at this point in time." 
Is time ripe to pull the plug on the WTO Doha Round issues? 
The East African, By Pradeep S. Mehta, 28 novembre 2015 -- The World Trade Organisation (WTO), director-general Roberto Azevêdo said at a recent meeting of Trade ministers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States in Brussels, that while the Doha Round core issues such as agriculture, market access and services remain on the negotiating agenda, there is a clear divergence among members on how these negotiations should take place: Whether under the Doha framework or under a new structure. While developing countries such as India, Brazil and South Africa wish to keep the Doha Round open, given that many of their concerns have not been addressed, developed countries such as the United States no longer see a future for the round in its current state. Although they agree on the importance of achieving the developmental mandate, their major sticking point is that the landscape of the global trading system has changed significantly since the round was launched. Emerging players like India and China want the framework reworked. A look at the history of trade negotiations reveals that missed deadlines are not a new phenomenon in the multilateral trading system. However, even by General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) standards, the Doha Round has drawn on for longer than usual. While developing countries may be opposed to closing the Doha Round in the light of the issues that remain unaddressed, in the long term, keeping it alive could do more damage than good to the multilateral trading system, and ultimately to the chances of fostering a strong development component within the global trading system. With each unsuccessful ministerial conference, the growing sense of collective disillusionment with the WTO is beginning to permeate trade policy and one of the most often-discussed effects of this has been the proliferation of regional trade agreements. The recently agreed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is one such example. Unless decisive action is taken, WTO’s negotiating arm faces the risk of being reduced to a vestigial organ, a state that developing countries cannot afford. The negotiating arm holds much more importance for developing countries, given that outside the WTO they do not have the clout to negotiate on a level playing field with larger developed countries. There have even been instances in the past, where developing countries have turned and accepted free trade areas with onerous provisions on agriculture and intellectual property rights that they had previously rejected at the WTO. As the relevance and authority of the WTO as a negotiating body are increasingly undermined, this perspective could begin to jeopardise the other arms of the body. The only practical solution may come through a compromise from both sides. For the sake of maintaining the legitimacy and credibility of the WTO, developing countries may have to consider forsaking their short-term ambitions to keep the Doha Round running for the sake of making progress in the long-term. Relenting to the closure of the Doha Round would not mean conceding defeat. Perhaps it is time to end negotiation rounds and, instead of a round of negotiations, implement a built-in agenda at the WTO consisting of existing issues of the Doha Round and new issues. This built-in agenda would have to include the progress that has been made in the Doha Round including decisions taken at various ministerial conferences since Singapore (1996). Instead of having one deadline, members should consider a series of them based on both developing and developed countries’ group needs. Pragmatically speaking, opening up the negotiations to include new elements that developing countries have been opposed to may be the only way to get developed countries to the negotiating table. While developing countries have expressed their opposition to bringing back the Singapore issues, perhaps it is worth reconsidering this stance in order to give them the much-need bargaining power to make substantive progress. 

Why China is now the world biggest champion for a united Africa
Quartz, by  John J Stremlau, University of the Witwatersrand , 28 Nov 2015 -- Beijing’s selection of South Africa to host the HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/en/partnerships/,DanaInfo=.aavBlry+africa_china" China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC) may indicate Chinese President Xi Jinping’s personal commitment to the continent. This is the first time the summit is being held at this level in Africa. It may also show his desire to reassure Africa that, despite recent HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.atigfss1lz1k4u11Os54,SSL+chinas-economic-slowdown-threatens-african-progress-49544" sharp declines in China’s trade and investment, the Chinese view is that this partnership is of long-term importance. And perhaps it signals China’s deepening special relationship with South Africa. So, what are we to expect? The Chinese government supports regional and sub-regional integration in Africa for many practical reasons. These relate to the scale and viability of its investments and the need to overcome the bewildering complexity of working with 54 sovereign states. Xi might be open to a more robust political dialogue on issues of African democracy, elections and good governance for two other related reasons:
to advance peace and security; and
to develop more politically capable states.
For his part, South African President Jacob Zuma is likely to avoid drawing attention to the significance of holding HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/eng/ltda/dwjbzjjhys_1/,DanaInfo=.awxyCjtihkIy2s+" the summit in a democracy. This won’t be out of a sense of false modesty but rather a misplaced respect for the several ageing African autocrats in attendance. It will also be in deference to his Chinese friends, from whom Zuma is reportedly seeking major funding for several HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/south-africa/,DanaInfo=.awxyCisihHlyx,SSL+zuma-china" grand national projects.
Deciphering the platitudes: The only formal work for the leaders will be to endorse the latest version of a familiar triennial HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/eng/zxxx/,DanaInfo=.awxyCjtihkIy2s+t954620.htm" action plan. This will cover joint economic, development and cultural initiatives. China has always been an outspoken advocate of African unity. President Xi is expected to reiterate commitment to Africa’s Agenda 2063. The only drama is likely to be the media speculation about the size of the new loan package Xi is expected to announce. China made a HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/%7E/media/Research/Files/Reports/2015/01/foresight-africa/,DanaInfo=.awxyCfwuvsrxr4Mss-+china-africa-cooperation-sun.pdf?la=en" US$20 billion commitment to the continent in 2012, augmented by another $10 billion a year later.Meanwhile, we should listen carefully to the pro-democracy comments leaders offer as the preferred political foundation for pan-African integration and Sino-African co-operation. From these we should try to discern new political realities beneath the hypocrisy and hype.China has always been an outspoken advocate of African unity. And Xi is expected to reiterate commitment to Africa’s Agenda 2063 for:… an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena. He is also likely to repeat China’s support for HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.awxyCezFpv2+" African Union commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s vision for a United States of Africa. The vision, which has been endorsed by all member states, has as a central goal: An Africa of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and rule of law.Xi invokes similar terms when he speaks of China HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/blogs/economist-explains/2014/11/,DanaInfo=.awxyCihuuwvs35Mq32+economist-explains-21" becoming, by the middle of the century:… a modern socialist country that is prosperous, democratic, and culturally advanced.Such promises may not matter to millions of socially active Chinese citizens, who have taken part in the more than 200,000 annual HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.abpqnwEmvwpvpLp2ODr,SSL+books?id=EQEVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=Public+Protests+in+China,+200+000&source=bl&ots=UDlAgTJTRo&sig=uS0ZXFfu2sxIINrxON844V4paXY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiB6sPyw6vJAhVCyRQKHXDfCaMQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=Public%20Protests%20in%20China%2C%20200%20000&f=false" public protests. The protests are often as severely suppressed as anti-government demonstrations in African countries.
The right to intervene: African countries have granted the African Union unprecedented HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/instruments/achpr/,DanaInfo=.awxyCehnwzIy2s+" powers for a regional or international organisation: the right to intervene in any of its members for humanitarian and human rights reasons. China continues to declare its strict adherence to non-interference. But it is showing a willingness to support African preventive intervention and more assertive peace enforcement. This is especially since two dramatic events:
its costly 2011 HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/_news/2011/03/03/,DanaInfo=.awptohgrvoIxmo0s.8Qu76+6181345-china-organizes-hasty-retreat-from-libya" emergency evacuation of nearly 36,000 Chinese oil workers from Libya; and
last year’s forced abandonment of its huge investments in HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.awxyCwzjhv21tn71tPt65+spip.php?article55056" South Sudan.
The African Union’s HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/en/sites/default/files/,DanaInfo=.awxyCezFpv2+ConstitutiveAct_EN.pdf" Constitutive Act also endorses an approach to political capacity-building in Africa that strongly favours civic over ethnic nationalism.Africa, after all, is the HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/,DanaInfo=.awxyC0fyoqwq400338-Rv87,SSL+" most ethnically diverse and conflict-prone region in the world. It is also plagued by complex emergencies and costly multilateral peacekeeping operations.China appears to be quite different. More than 90% of its people are ethnic Han. But there are also more than 55 ethnic minorities. Many of these are seeking greater HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/conversation/,DanaInfo=.awxyCgmouioswqMq32+are-ethnic-tensions-rise-china" self-determination.The African Union’s unanimously adopted HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/idd-E/,DanaInfo=.awxyCmu0Gw0q+afr_charter.pdf" African Charter on democracy, elections and governance came into effect in 2012. It is a far more progressive and ambitious attempt to advance pan-African civic nationalism than has ever been undertaken in China. And it is an experiment that even a few Chinese diplomats and scholars I have spoken to think might someday hold lessons for political reform in China. China ostensibly shares the African Union’s commitment to civic nationalism, but ignores its own constitutional HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/englishnpc/Constitution/,DanaInfo=.awxyCruiGox5Ko0+node_2825.htm" provisions for the protection of basic human rights and civil liberties. These include freedom of speech, of the press and of assembly. Virtually all African states have founding documents with similar provisions. But, unlike China, they hold regular national elections, albeit of varying degrees of integrity. Democratic elections are a necessary, if limited, condition for peacefully and legally accommodating factional domestic conflict. This is a step China may not be prepared to take domestically. But it has begun deploying election observation missions in Africa. I met one when leading an HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/peace/democracy/,DanaInfo=.awxyCgfx0m0mpz6s6P59z+observed.html" observation team to the 2013 Madagascar elections. Democratic elections were a key milestone in the HYPERLINK "https://iconnect.wto.org/files/2613/8675/7746/,DanaInfo=.awxyCwfjjHrx4+Launch_Statement_Round_TWO_Madagascar_09-12-2013docx.pdf" Southern African Development Community’s “road map” to help secure a peaceful transition and prevent further deadly conflict.China is the world’s most economically successful authoritarian government. It will continue favouring like-minded authoritarian regimes, notably non-resource-rich Ethiopia and Rwanda.But it also shows surprising interest in, and support for, a variety of African democratic experiments. Listening to Xi, and watching how he and his subordinates respond to democratic developments in Africa, may be more indicative of the endurance of the partnership than fluctuations in trade and investment.

Turkey- Kazakhstan continues to expand trade and economic cooperation with the Islamic world 
Middle East North Africa Financial Network (MENAFN), 28 novembre 2015, (MENAFN - The Journal Of Turkish Weekly) Kazakhstan continues to expand trade and economic cooperation with the Islamic world.Last week Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov instructed region's governors to revise industrial projects implemented within the second five-year phase of the state program on industrial and innovation development. The Prime Minister gave the instructions at the Government sitting. Although before that K. Massimov ordered Minister of Investment and Development of Kazakhstan Asset Issekeshev to submit for the consideration of the Government already approved amendments to the program by March 1 2016. As earlier reported the telephone conference of the Government of Kazakhstan was held. During the conference the participants considered measures on fulfillment of the instructions given by the Head of State at the enlarged sitting of the Government on November 18 2015. In addition following the meeting the Prime Minister instructed the Ministry of National Economy to establish the crisis plan to support entrepreneurs. At teleconference of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan Deputy Prime Minister Dariga Nazarbayeva said that addressing employment issues should be the first on the agenda of local executive bodies. Deputy Prime Minister raised the issue of the numerous violations in the use of budgetary funds allocated for the implementation of the Roadmap of employment in the regions. November 25 Kazakh Senate adopted the law "On republican budget for 2016-2018". According to first vice-minister of the National Economy Marat Kussainov in 2016 the budget revenues will amount to 3 trillion 655 billion tenge in 2017 - 3 trillion 867 billion tenge in 2018 - 4 trillion 195 billion tenge. He said that the budget expenditures in 2016 will amount to 7 trillion 666 billion tenge in 2017 - 8 trillion 194 billion tenge in 2018 - 7 trillion 661 billion tenge. The budget deficit in 2016 will be 723.4 billion tenge - 1.6 percent of GDP; in 2017 - 608 billion tenge or 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018 - 552.3 billion tenge of 1 percent of GDP.  Senators have also adopted the law "On guaranteed transfer from the National Fund for 2016-2018". According to the law the annual guaranteed transfer from the National Fund will amount to 2.4 trillion tenge. As it was previously reported the national budget for 2016-2017 was updated in view of the changed socio-economic development of Kazakhstan and the situation on foreign markets. Vice Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Dariga Nazarbayeva called businesswomen to join the upcoming second stage of privatization. "In 90s Kazakhstani women could not partake in privatization. But now I am calling you to use this opportunity and join the privatization process" she said addressing the participants of the IV Eurasian Summit of Women in Astana. The Vice PM invited the women to focus on social sphere in privatization. "Social infrastructure facilities - kindergartens hospitals out-patient hospitals schools - are falling under denationalization too" she noted. D. Nazarbayeva promised also to help those women who want to privatize even large industrial enterprises. "I welcome such decisions and I will help you" she concluded. Minister of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Yerbolat Dossayev took part in the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul Turkey. 31st meeting of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation was held in Istanbul under the chairmanship of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan and the Secretary General of the Organization Iyad Madani. Following the session Yerbolat Dossayev signed a general agreement on economic trade and technical cooperation between the member countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The general agreement is one of the main documents regulating economic cooperation of the OIC. "Kazakhstan's accession to the agreement will give a new impetus to the development of close partnerships with the OIC countries intensify collaboration with Islamic financial and economic institutions and facilitate attraction of investments to Kazakhstan" said Mr. Dossayev. In addition the meeting considered preparations for the 1st General Assembly of the Islamic Organization for Food Security. The event reportedly will take place in April 2016 in Astana. It is expected that during the event the Government of Kazakhstan and the Islamic Organization for Food Security will sign an agreement on the legal status of the Islamic Organization for Food Security. 
"El acuerdo consideró las adaptaciones específicas solicitadas por Ecuador" 
El Parlamento Europeo destacó que la pobreza en el país decreció en los últimos 7 años. En ese período, el Gobierno ecuatoriano invirtió más de $ 40 mil millones en los sectores sociales. 
El Telégrafo, 28 de nov de 2015 -- El Parlamento Europeo (PE), por una abrumadora mayoría de 499 votos a favor, aprobó el jueves la Resolución para la Adhesión del Ecuador al Acuerdo Comercial Multipartes (ACM) que integran Perú y Colombia con la Unión Europea. Peter Schwaiger, encargado de Negocios A.I. de la Unión Europea residente en Ecuador, en entrevista con EL TELÉGRAFO, calificó de positiva la aprobación del Parlamento Europeo, donde se felicita “por la conclusión de las negociaciones con Ecuador sobre el Protocolo de Adhesión al Acuerdo Multipartes”. La Comisión de Comercio Internacional del Parlamento Europeo (INTA) destacó los “esfuerzos de Ecuador hacia una sociedad más integradora” y que la pobreza y la pobreza extrema en el país decrecieron en los últimos 7 años, según datos del Banco Mundial (BM), período en el que el Gobierno ecuatoriano invirtió más de $ 40 mil millones en los sectores sociales. Además, señaló que esta aprobación conllevará la adopción de medidas que aseguren que el comercio y la inversión contribuyan a aliviar la pobreza y reducir las desigualdades. ¿Qué significa la aprobación de hoy del Parlamento Europeo (PE) sobre el apoyo a la adhesión de Ecuador al acuerdo de comercio? Es una señal muy positiva que el PE haya adoptado esta resolución política, donde se felicita por la conclusión de las negociaciones con Ecuador sobre el Protocolo de Adhesión al Acuerdo Multipartes y reconoce los importantes beneficios que aportará a las exportaciones de Ecuador a la Unión Europea (UE), tomando en cuenta que el país no se beneficiará más del Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias Unilateral del bloque, luego del 31 de diciembre de 2016. Es por esta razón también que el PE pide la entrada en vigor y la aplicación rápida y completa de este acuerdo, que además garantizará la protección de los ciudadanos y del medio ambiente al más alto nivel. ¿Ecuador solicitó adaptaciones específicas durante las negociaciones? Esta resolución también destaca que el Acuerdo Multipartes consideró las adaptaciones específicas solicitadas por Ecuador.  La resolución abre el camino para un diálogo político entre Ecuador y el PE que acompañará  el proceso de ratificación en la Eurocámara previsto para el año próximo. Cabe aclarar que esta resolución del Parlamento Europeo es diferente de la resolución legislativa que deberá tomarse al momento de la ratificación del Acuerdo Multipartes.  Los eurodiputados insisten en la necesidad de que el país adopte algunos compromisos. Si el país no los adopta, ¿qué pasaría? La resolución destaca la importancia de que Ecuador vele para que sus políticas estén acordes con sus compromisos asumidos ante la Organización Mundial de Comercio (OMC) y con aquellos del Acuerdo Multipartes, y promueva una transparencia plena y unas consultas amplias con las partes interesadas ante su adopción. Pide también que Ecuador elimine a la mayor brevedad los obstáculos para el acceso a los mercados que se han detectado. Además, le recuerda sobre la importancia de mantener el respeto de los derechos humanos, medioambientales y laborales como fundamento de las relaciones con la Unión Europea.  No se trata entonces de asumir compromisos nuevos o adicionales, sino que observe el cumplimiento de los compromisos existentes. También se están pidiendo salvaguardias para el banano ecuatoriano, sin embargo, Colombia y países de Centroamérica exportan a la UE a precios más bajos que el producto del país. ¿Habría un trato distinto con Ecuador? El PE está pidiendo a la Comisión Europea que vigile las cláusulas de salvaguardia en el caso de que las importaciones de bananas a la UE aumentaran de forma desproporcionada, causando graves perjuicios a las economías de las regiones productoras de la UE, teniendo en cuenta que los países andinos son exportadores de dicha fruta a la UE. Por lo tanto, la cláusula no hace alusión expresa a Ecuador o le otorga un trato distinto, sino que menciona a los tres países andinos. Una vez que entre en vigor el Acuerdo Multipartes, Ecuador pagará un euro adicional a los precios que pagan actualmente Colombia y los países de Centroamérica, acortando así la diferencia de precio que actualmente existe al no contar con el acuerdo comercial.  Las negociaciones de un acuerdo entre la UE y los países de la Comunidad Andina iniciaron en 2007 y continuaron en 2009 con Colombia, Ecuador y Perú. En julio de 2009, Ecuador se retiró de las negociaciones con la UE, mientras que la comunidad cerró acuerdos con Colombia y Perú en marzo de 2010. La firma se dio en junio de 2012. ¿Qué beneficios obtendrá Ecuador con el acuerdo? El acuerdo contiene cláusulas de salvaguardia también a favor de Ecuador y, además, exime unos 200 productos, sobre todo agrícolas, en aras a proteger el sector rural ecuatoriano. La resolución del Parlamento Europeo menciona Colombia, Perú y Ecuador, pero no hay un trato distinto para Ecuador.  Luego de la aprobación del Parlamento Europeo, ¿cuál es el siguiente paso previo a la firma del acuerdo comercial? Para la firma del acuerdo comercial se debe primero contar con la aprobación al Protocolo de Adhesión por parte de Colombia y Perú. Luego debe obtenerse la aprobación del Consejo de Ministros por los Estados miembros y luego se pasa a la firma del acuerdo. Posterior a ello sigue el proceso de ratificación por el Parlamento Europeo, que es la última etapa.
Climate change to saturate labour markets and drive down wages: report 
UNI (United News of India), New Delhi, Nov. 29 -- Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, countries that together make up almost a quarter of the world's inhabitants, face life-altering effects of climate change which threatens to saturate labour markets and drive down wages, a research report said. The report by 'Justjobs' Network,' a global think tank in collaboration with 'Union to Union', a Swedish non-profit organisation and 'Observer Research Foundation', a public policy think tank said estimated number of environmental migrants may reach one billion by 2050. The report, entitled 'The Changing Climate of Livelihoods: Case Studies from Bangladesh, India and Indonesia", shows that effect of climate change will be particularly concentrated in countries like Bangladesh. "It is important to understand how this migration will impact labour markets and social and political stability," said Dr Sabina Dewan, the Executive Director of 'JustJobs Network.'The report emphasises the important role trade unions play in addressing the climate crisis. "Through the methods of social dialogue and collective bargaining, we offer solutions to mitigate the harmful impact of climate change on workers and their livelihoods," said Dr Kristina Henschen, Director of Union to Union. Throughout the world, migration induced by climate change threatens to saturate labour markets and drive down wages and working conditions," the report pointed out. The report said the study demonstrates how adaptation and mitigation measures laid out in the 'Intended Nationally Determined Contributions plans (INDCs)' for these countries might affect labour market dynamics. According to the study, the climate change will also impact livelihoods of vulnerable communities around the world. It said the Paris agreement needs to give "central attention" to the need to support the creation of jobs and livelihood opportunities for those who are adversely impacted at the same time also ensuring that new opportunities are inclusive," said Dr Vikrom Mathur, Senior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation. The report proposed policy recommendations for governments, trade unions, NGOs and the private sector to take immediate action to mitigate the devastation, through expanding job-creating sectors like renewable energy, investing in skills training for migrant workers, and establishing worker protections and safety nets. 


German experience matters 
Dhaka Tribune, By Hans-Joachim Fuchtel, 29 novembre 2015 -- In Bangladesh, the government, employers, and trade unions are co-operating on modernising the garment sector. Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ) supports this tripartite approach. On April 2013, Rana Plaza collapsed in Dhaka. About 1,100 people died, and many more were wounded. This was only the worst incident of a long series of accidents. It changed a lot -- in Bangladesh as well as in consumer countries such as Germany. Workers in Rana Plaza made t-shirts, shirts, and blouses, some of which were exported to Germany. Consumers all over the world can no longer shut their eyes to the fact that they are directly involved in trade relations that not only result in cheap clothing, but also in labour conditions that are potentially inhumane and even life-threatening. For Bangladesh, Rana Plaza became a tipping point. Political leaders and business managers realised that the country's garment sector, which had seen years of spectacular growth, had to change in order to secure even a mid-term future. Progress must be made in regard to occupational safety and health, fair wages, and environmental impacts. The BMZ wants to support such change, and it is in a position to do so, both in Germany and production countries like Bangladesh. In the autumn of 2014, Germany's Development Minister Gerd Müller launched the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles for this purpose. It unites representatives of industry, civil society, trade unions, and regulating authorities with the goal of improving social and environmental standards as well as wage levels throughout the entire supply chain. 
In Bangladesh, the BMZ has invested about 16m euros since 2010 to contribute to raising social and environmental standards. There is proof of some 800 production sites shoring up their compliance with national and international standards in the past five years. More than 100,000 workers, most of them women, have been made aware of their rights. So far, our efforts have mostly targeted private-sector companies, workers, and government agencies at local levels. Germany has a long history of dialogue of employers and trade unions. Such dialogue has driven industrialisation in a constructive manner. To share such experiences, I have initiated the Tripartite Exchange for Bangladeshi representatives of industry, labour, and government. The idea is to facilitate practice-based learning, for instance by allowing a young worker's representative to observe a German counterpart on the shop floor for a few weeks. I am convinced that such exchange will result in a critical mass for change. By early 2017, we intend to complete the training of 100 young persons from Bangladesh. In August, the first 24 participants came to Germany on my invitation. The delegation visited Dresden, Köln, Bad Münstereifel, and Berlin. The participants had opportunities to deepen their understanding of precautionary measures and occupational safety by sharing ideas with labour leaders and managers in German textile companies. The essential aspect was to put workers' representatives and labour inspectors in touch with their German counterparts. Seamstresses from Bangladesh thus gained first-hand insights of labour conditions in Germany. The program is funded by the BMZ, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and Germany's Statutory Accident Insurance (DGUV). Tofail Ahmed, the trade minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and Muhammad Mujibu Haque Chunnu, its labour minister, came to Dresden for the launch of the program. Ahmed announced that his country will establish a statutory accident insurance for the garment sector, taking into account the experiences made in Germany. In co-operation with the ILO, the BMZ will support this approach right from the start. It matters that such a system should focus on prevention and rehabilitation in order to reduce the need for financial compensations in the event of accidents. Gilbert Houngbo, deputy director-general of ILO, pointed out that it is up to Bangladesh to decide precisely what kind of system suits the country best.
