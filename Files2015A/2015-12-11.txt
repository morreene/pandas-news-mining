India hardens stand on special safeguard mechanism at WTO 
Asit Ranjan Mishra, Mint, 11 December 2015, New Delhi, Dec. 11 -- Further hardening India's stance on the safeguards to protect developing nations from sudden import surges from highly subsidised farm products of developed nations, trade secretary Rita Teaotia on Thursday said the special safeguard mechanism (SSM) is a right of developing countries and not a bargaining chip. Speaking to reporters ahead of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Nairobi, Teaotia said starting a new round of multilateral trade talks by abandoning the ongoing Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is not acceptable to India without harvesting the developmental agenda in the Doha round. "I don't think SSM needs a counter-balance (for developed countries). This is a facility available to so many countries. Why should it not be available to us? It's not a bargaining chip," she said. Teaotia said there is a large group of developing countries who say that SSM is necessary because subsidies to agriculture have not been reduced by the developed countries. "Developed countries are giving 70-80% subsidies to their farmers, which only they can afford to give. We don't have the wherewithal to pay these kinds of subsidies. It distorts prices and make our farmers vulnerable when the products hit our markets. It is against those kinds of aberrations that we need protection. That's what SSM will do," she added. Although India has the headroom to increase tariffs to counter cheap imports of farm products in a large number of products, Teaotia said that in some products like poultry, dairy and apples, India has lost the headroom for such protection. "Dairy and poultry are large industries for us. It's not like we don't have an issue," she said. Teaotia said the Doha talks contain the work of many years and reflects the development aspirations of developing countries and hence, cannot be abandoned midway. "We believe that's a fundamental piece of work that is long in the making and we need to harvest from that," she said. Accepting that finding a permanent solution to public stockholding for food security purposes (where there is an indefinite reprieve is in place for developing countries), may not be an emergency, Teaotia said "but it is something countries agreed to find a solution by end 2015". "Maybe at end of Nairobi, we can devise a work programme which takes this forward," she said. On discussing new issues beyond those mentioned in the Doha round, Teaotia said India is open to identifying the new issues to be discussed and building a consensus around it only after DDA is harvested at the Nairobi meeting. On the cancellation of free trade talks with the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union after it put a ban on GVK Biosciences Ltd, Teaotia said it was an "expression of concern" on India's part of what the country perceived as an "extremely disproportionate reaction to the perceived infringement". Teaotia said in January, the two chief trade negotiators are expected to meet for taking stock of the free trade talks and no actual negotiation will take place. "That meeting will decide, does the negotiations have a future? Hopefully, in the interest of everyone, it does," she said. 
 
India demands safeguards from import surge at WTO 
The Times of India - Delhi Edition, 11 December 2015 -- India on Thursday said that HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO members need to allow developing countries use special safeguard measures (SSM) to raise tariffs in case of an import surge as it sought additional ammunition to deal with possible spikes in dairy , poultry and apple shipments into the country . Days before the ministerial meeting in Nairobi, the government listed out its priorities with commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman stating that India should not be made to pay twice to get a permanent solution to its food security problem after having agreed to a package that included a trade facilitation agreement to ease restrictions on flow of goods at ports and airports. "I am not looking at the permanent solution to public stockholding as a demand because I presume it's been agreed in Bali... Let's honour Bali ... let's deliver Bali."She underlined the need to move ahead on the issue as it would allow the government to ensure that farmers received adequate compensation and there were sufficient food products to meet the requirements ofthe public distribution system. But there are two other critical elements on India's wish list. "Our wish-list would certainly be that we say no to the differential treatment... I certain ly want SSM to protect (farmers) from any surge (in imports) that may happen," the minister added. Commerce secretary Rita Teaotia added that the demand for SSM was not out of place given that similar facility was available to other countries. Besides, she added that the facility was meant to counter the impact of a surge from subsidised imports from developed countries. Talks at HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO are deadlocked as the 162 members cannot narrow their differences on a variety of trade issues. Given the stalemate, the developed countries are demanding that the Doha Round of negotiations should be ignored and new issues be included. 
 
No Intention to Delay WTO Talks: Commerce Secy 
The Economic Times - Mumbai Edition, 11 December 2015 -- Ahead of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation ministerial meet next week, India has clarified that it has no intention of causing any delays in the new round of negotiations but said that it wants the Doha development round to reach its logical conclusion first."We have DDA (Doha Development Agenda) on the table. Let us achieve outcomes there. We don't want DDA to be dispensed with. We hope there is political will from all member countries...our intention is not to delay anything," said commerce secretary Rita Teaotia, while addressing the media in Delhi. This will be the key point of discussions when trade ministers of 162 countries meet in Nairobi from December 15-18. Referring to the new issues such as e-commerce, labour and environment, which developed countries want to include in the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO negotiations, Teaotia said, "There are differing interests in the DDA framework, but enough space to find consensus." India has been pushing for the continuation of the Doha round ar guing on behalf of the developing countries that the developmen agenda on agricultural issues, cot ton subsidies and least developed countries or LDCs has not been completely addressed. Almost a hundred other coun tries want such issues to be ad dressed and are opposed to the clo sure of this round. Apart from the existing issues, In dia also wants the right to safe guard mechanism in case of sud den rise in imports or fall in prices Teaotia said that the mechanism is not a bargaining chip for India but a facility that is available to many other countries. PMO OKAYS NEGOTIATING MANDATE The commerce department has secured a negotiating mandate from the Prime Minister's Office and will apprise the Cabinet after the talks."In a sense, the discussions have taken place. So there will be no further meeting. It has been happening intermittently . We have been given the negotiating mandate by the Cabinet Secretariat. It has been already taken from the PMO also," said a commerce department official. Separately, the department has prepared another Cabinet note on India's preparedness on ratifying the Trade Facilitation Agreement, detailing which all commitments can be fulfilled immediately and which require a transition period."We are already committed to trade facilitation and these are just formalities of the accession," said another official. 
 
PREVIEW Trade ministers meet as WTO reaches make-or-break moment By Thomas Burmeister, dpa 
dpa International Service in English,11 December 2015 03:05, A global free trade agreement could boost flagging exports and imports around the world. But the slow pace of the negotiations is throwing the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization into doubt. Geneva (dpa) - Diplomats and officials at the seat of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) in Geneva like to talk about what could or may happen if they were to finally close a global free trade deal. An upturn in trade could provide momentum to the global economy and create jobs, they say. However, ahead of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO meeting of trade ministers starting in Nairobi on Tuesday, chances of a breakthrough look slim. Growth of exports and imports has been slowing for years. In September, the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO had to downgrade its trade forecasts again, citing falling commodity prices and slower demand in large emerging markets like China. World trade would grow only 3.9 per cent next year, down from 4 per cent projected in April, the world trade body's economists said then. WTO Director General HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Roberto Azevedo wants to see some action and results. "HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO members can help to set trade growth on a more robust trajectory by seizing the initiative on a number of fronts, notably by negotiating concrete outcomes by our December Ministerial Conference in Nairobi," he said. But all the Brazilian WTO chief's pushing and pleading to overcome differences and remove trade hurdles have had little effect so far. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO member countries had agreed 14 years ago in Doha that they would work to reduce protectionist measures and open up markets. Tariffs for industrial goods, barriers on services and agricultural export subsidies are to be scrapped. At the same time, poor countries are to be fully integrated into the trade system by doing away with Western measures that hamper exports from developing countries. "There have been no results so far," the Federation of German Industries has said ahead of the conference in Kenya. "Concluding these multilateral negotiations is long overdue," the Federation said. The line of economic and political conflict runs between the group of emerging and developing countries - led by China, India and Brazil - on one hand, and the United States, Japan and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union on the other. There was a ray of hope when HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO trade ministers met in late 2013 in Bali. There, they agreed to the so-called Bali Package, which addressed parts of the Doha agenda. It included the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that aims to simplify customs bureacracy and measures to reduce some agriculture subsidies. Implementing the TFA could raise merchandise trade by up to a trillion dollars per year, the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO calculates. Developing countries could boost their exports by up to 730 billion dollars, and millions of new jobs could result from the deal, according to the forecasts. However, fewer than 60 countries have ratified the TFA so far. While the Doha process has remained stuck, regional trade deals have been negotiated in parallel. Although the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" EU has raised much controversy in Europe, its completion currently looks more likely than the Doha talks. Last month, a dozen countries on both sides of the Pacific proved that developed and developing countries are able to agree on trade issues when they closed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal in October after seven years of talks. Both the TTIP and the TTP deals would account for half of global trade, raising the question whether the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO and its negotiations are still relevant. The United States and other countries have already called for shelving the Doha plans and for reforming HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. "Time is running short," said Claudia Schmucker, an economist at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. "If the big trade partners don't move now, it would lead to a failure of the [Doha] round and could damage the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO's role as the guardian of world trade," she said.

India will bat for permanent solution at WTO meet 
Hindustan Times, 11 December 2015, New Delhi, Dec. 11 -- India will strongly pitch for a permanent solution for food security and a tool for developing nations to protect their farmers from sudden surge in imports at the World Trade organisation's (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO's) Nairobi meeting next week, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. "If everybody has agreed on something in Bali, it should be our duty to deliver on that. Permanent solution was part of that Bali package." India "certainly wants" HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO's ministerial declaration to mention the special safeguard mechanism (SSM) to protect poor and marginal farmers from any surge in imports or steep decline in prices," Sitharaman said. 
The Nairobi ministerial will take place from December 15-17 and is key to the negotiations as developing nations join hands to lobby for retaining their subsidies, which are crucial both economically and politically. 
A cutback in subsidies can have severe consequences in India were 57% of the labour force is engaged in agriculture. 
India has argued that it procures foodgrain from farmers primarily to run its public distribution system and maintain reserve stocks. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO pegs the maximum value of subsidies at 10% of the total value of a county's agricultural production. India's agricultural subsidies fall in this category. 
 
Food subsidy: govt to insist on discussion at WTO 
Business Line (The Hindu),11 December 2015 -- Not to entertain ‘one-off’ proposals; will push special safeguard measures India will not respond to “one-off’’ proposals from developed members of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation (WTO) such as the EU that has reportedly suggested that New Delhi agrees on a cap for its minimum support price programmes in return for a permanent solution on treating such subsidies without attracting penalties. “The discussions on a permanent solution have to be based on the paper submitted by the G-33 (which includes India and 45 other developing countries). We are going to insist on a work programme based on it at the Nairobi ministerial meet next week. We will not respond to any one-off proposals (as the one made by the EU),” Commerce Secretary Rita Teaotia said at a press conference on Thursday. The G-33, in its paper, has suggested that either food procurement subsidies be regarded as a non-trade distorting permissible subsidy or be calculated based on prices that reflect the current market situation rather than those prevailing almost two decades ago. 
Development issues 
At the trade ministers’ meeting in Nairobi on December 15-18, the country will push for a satisfactory resolution of development issues flowing from the Doha Development Round before members move to discussions on new issues such as competition policy, investment and environment, the Commerce Secretary reiterated. India will strongly demand a special safeguard measure (SSM) to protect farmers against import surges and price fluctuations as lowering of farm subsidies by rich countries has been very slow, she said. India will strongly demand special measures to protect farmers against import surges and price fluctuations 
 
US seeks new group for Chindia at WTO 
Sidhartha, The Times of India 11 December 2015, NEW DELHI: At the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation (WTO) headquarters in Geneva, there have been voices — largely from the US — suggesting that a new category of countries be created apart from the three main groups — developed, developing and least developed countries. It has been suggested that the new group should comprise the rapidly growing economies, such as China and India, which have gained considerable mass in recent years. Although there has not been an explicit demand to create a new group of emerging countries, there have been discussions behind closed doors that have raised eyebrows in the Capital. After all, this move has the potential to change the way global talks have taken place in the past and the impact may be felt beyond trade. “It has strategic implications that go beyond just HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO. If the demand finds merit then other negotiations, including the climate talks, may be impacted,” said a source based in Geneva. At the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO, it would push China, India and others, which fall into the same category of advanced developing countries, to go for sharper duty cuts and adjust their rules related to, say, trade facilitation, more quickly than developing countries. While there has been chatter for several years, there is more discussion today. “The US is more bothered about China and its impact on the global economy but India is also getting clubbed into the same group, given that it is growing fast,” the source said. Economists, however, believe that the demand may be a little premature given that there is huge disparity between the developed countries and those in the second group, such as China and India. “Size of China’s economy is same as US, but China’s per capita income is 22% of the US per capita income because China has four-and-half times more people. It makes Chinese per capita income like where US income was in late 1920s or mid-1930s,” former US treasury secretary Larry Summers had pointed out in a recent interview to TOI. Currently, Chinese per cacapita income is around 14% of the US level. India fares even worse. It’s per capita GDP is less than half of Indonesia’s level and around one-fifth of China’s. In fact, on several human development indicators, India can be compared with the poorest countries. But the noise has certainly made the government wake up and take note. “We will certainly say no to differentiated treatment, where you want to differentiate between developing countries with high and low growth rates... India may have a very high growth rate but the development indicators are not well spread,” commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, pointing out that even basic infrastructure is missing in some parts of the country. 
 
Don't link permanent solution food security to Nairobi talks: India tells WTO 
Sidhartha, The Times of India, 11 December 2015, NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday said that it would seek special safeguard measures to protect vulnerable farmers from import surge and insisted that a permanent solution should not be linked to outcome of talks on other issues at the Nairobi ministerial meeting of HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO next week. "If something was agreed in Bali, everyone should deliver... We will be paying the price (if it was linked to other issues)," commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. 
She also said India would not like a differentiation between developing countries as is being demanded by countries such as the US, which have indicated that India and China should take higher commitments. "India may be growing at a very high rate but development indicators are not well spread," she said. Commerce secretary Rita Teaotia separately identified poultry, dairy and apples among farm goods that needed protection from possible import surges, arguing that through special safeguard measures India and some other countries were only demanding a facility that was available to many others. 
 
Agriculture: manque de protection à la frontière
L'Agéfi, jeudi, 10.12.2015 
L'Association suisse pour un secteur agroalimentaire fort estime que la Suisse n'utilise pas toute la marge de manoeuvre disponible dans le cadre de l'OMC pour protéger les produits nationaux.
Une étude mandatée par l’Association suisse pour un secteur agroalimentaire fort a analysé les effets des accords OMC pour des produits agricoles choisis. Les conclusions montrent que le système actuel de contingents offre une protection à la frontière, ce qui permet une production suisse de produits comme les fraises, abricots ou tomates. La Suisse, par manque de volonté politique intérieure, n’utilise cependant pas toute la marge de manœuvre disponible dans le cadre des engagements OMC pour protéger ses produits agricoles. L’ASSAF-Suisse revendique d’avantage de fermeté face à l’OMC afin de protéger les acquis, aussi en ce qui concerne la loi chocolatière. 
Protection à la frontière indispensable
L’étude réalisée par des étudiantes en économie de la HES d’Olten a démontré les effets positifs de la protection à la frontière pour des produits vulnérables comme les fraises, abricots ou tomates cerise. Les phases protégées, durant la période de production indigène, permettent un fonctionnement du marché indigène et la réalisation de prix aux producteurs couvrant les frais de production plus élevés en Suisse. L’étude a aussi montré la problématique des accords OMC qui sont très statiques. Des changements sont très difficiles à apporter, une fois les engagements signés. Il est ainsi quasiment impossible pour la Suisse de modifier le niveau de protection pour un produit, même si la production suisse se développe, comme cela est le cas pour les tomates cerise. 
Manque de volonté politique interne
Même si les accords OMC fixent un cadre, la Suisse garde une marge de manœuvre dans le cadre des droits de douane maximaux notifiés à l’OMC. Force est de constater que la Suisse, par manque de volonté politique interne, n’exploite de loin pas toujours la marge de manœuvre à disposition. En conséquence, les prix payés aux producteurs demeurent sous pression, à l’exemple de la betterave sucrière. L’ASSAF-Suisse dénonce cette attitude regrettable du Conseil fédéral et de l’administration. 
Enjeux importants à Nairobi
La conférence ministérielle de l’OMC, qui se tiendra du 15 au 18 décembre à Nairobi pourrait avoir des impacts importants pour le secteur agroalimentaire Suisse. L’ASSAF-Suisse demande aux représentants suisses de défendre les acquis, notamment en matière de loi chocolatière. La Suisse n’est pas un mauvais élève dans le domaine des subventions à l’exportation. D’autre pays pratiquent et développent cet outil sous des facettes bien moins transparentes que la Suisse comme par exemple l’aide alimentaire ou la promotion des ventes vers des pays tiers. Il s’agit de tenir ferme et de défendre le secteur agroalimentaire Suisse à Nairobi.
