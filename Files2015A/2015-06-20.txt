Revote sees TPA head to Senate

US POLITICIANS have voted to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate a major trans-Pacific trade accord, moving it closer to his desk after a dramatic defeat last week.
 
Trade Promotion Authority narrowly passed the House of Representatives by 218 votes to 208 as a stand-alone bill, after congressional leaders uncoupled it from a worker-assistance program that crashed to defeat when most Democrats voted against it in order to block the trade package.
 
TPA now heads to the US Senate, where it could receive a vote as early as next week.
 
Holding the vote so soon after last week's blockage signalled Republican congressional leaders' confidence they have sufficient votes to get the entire package across the finish line.
 


 
Fate of TPP may be resolved by next week

The fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade and investment pact may be known as early as next Wednesday, US time, after a vote in the US Congress endorsed the elusive “fast-track authority” that President Barack Obama needs if the 12 nation negotiation is to be concluded successfully.
 
However, the next few days will be a “swirling mass”, says New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser, who concedes that even if a Senate vote confirms the fast-track, New Zealand has yet to see its most important sector, the dairy industry, included in the agreement.
 
TPP promises to tie together some 40 per cent of world trade and would represent New Zealand’s first free-trade agreements with three of the world’s largest and most agriculturally protected economies: Japan, the United States and Canada.
 
However, Groser indicated that New Zealand might have to just settle for dairy products included in the agreement. “We can’t join TPP if it were to exclude dairy products, but I don’t for one minute believe that’s the issue.
 
He said that from New Zealand’s perspective, there was now “a very good deal on everything but dairy products.”
 
“It’s not to say that there’s a bad deal on dairy products, it’s more to say that there’s no deal. We’ve barely started.
 
“Phoney negotiating positions have been put on the table but that doesn’t help a professional negotiator make a judgement as to where the landing zone is.”
 
Japan and Canada, the biggest opponents of a dairy deal along with the US, have said they will not negotiate TPP to a conclusion unless the US grants the president fast-track authority, thus preventing the US Congress from picking a multi-country deal apart on the floor of the House of Representatives.
 
TPP is widely politically opposed because of fears about its entrenchment of investor state dispute settlement provisions, allowing corporations to take governments to quasi-legal arbitration if they object to policy changes, and its treatments in areas such as intellectual property and medical procurement.
 
A successful Senate vote would “unlock the end game for the TPP”. “The stakes are very high here for the United States,” said Groser. “Is the United States going to play a leadership role in global trade in the first quarter of the 21st century or not?”
 
Failure to secure fast-track, also known as TPA, would jeopardise TPP but also the US’s attempt to create a similar deal with the European Union known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.
 
While the 10-vote Congressional majority appeared slender, Groser said he was assured from US Trade Representative Mike Froman overnight that it had passed “comfortably”, with Democrat members of the Congress voting tactically to oppose it to protect trade union support and funding in their own electorates.
 
Obama has argued a US failure on TPP risks ceding to its greatest geo-political rival, China, leadership on how trade rules are written in the future.
 
Assuming a successful Senate vote, meetings between chief negotiators and a ministerial meeting would be required in the next six weeks, along with coming to a deal for dairy, Groser said. Negotiators will not want the talks sliding into the American summer holidays in August and September, with the political pressure of the 2016 US presidential election looming.
 


 
 
 
Congress's fast track to discord on free trade; US needs to discover a better way to forge agreement on global deals
20 June 2015
Financial Times
.   
 
Congress last week blocked the "fast-track" trade promotion authority (TPA) that would have given President Barack Obama the power to submit trade deals, notably the forthcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to a yes-no vote on Capitol Hill. This week, after some procedural trickery, the House of Representatives passed a version of it.
 
Whether the decision can be replicated in the Senate will rely on a set of interlocking manoeuvres and trade-offs blindingly convoluted even by the world-class standards of Washington . Yet the very fact that constructing a majority has proved so difficult only underlines the lack of political legitimacy in the process. By spreading disaffection with trade policy, driving TPA and then TPP through Congress without broad support could be a mixed blessing. Unless a much wider coalition in favour of such pacts can be constructed, the US model for trade deals is coming to the end of its useful life.
 
The current paradigm for setting trade policy is for the US administration to negotiate deals under increasingly paranoid levels of secrecy and then present a take-it-or-leave-it deal to Congress via the fast-track mechanism. The latter part is understandable. Allowing amendments to a trade bill would mean the administration having to go back and negotiate changes with the other signatory governments, setting off a potentially infinite series of iterations.
 
Yet the more secrecy that surrounds trade deals, the less legitimate TPA becomes. There is no good reason for denying legislators, along with campaign groups, the media and the public, the right to see at least the outlines of negotiations like the TPP as they are going along. This is especially true when they involve issues of intense domestic controversy such as intellectual property rights At least some of the current reluctance of some lawmakers in Congress to pass TPA is linked to the fact that they will then be presented with a yes-no vote on a trade deal over which they have had almost no say.
 
Without a means of constructively setting trade policy, the US system - and that of the EU - could slip towards the impotence that characterises the World Trade Organization. Multilateral deals under the WTO would be considerably superior to bilateral or regional arrangements. But with the failure of the so-called "Doha round", the WTO has been allowed to become a forum where striking poses is far more prevalent than actually agreeing deals.
 
To see how this state of affairs might infect trade policy in the US, one has only to turn to Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in the House. Ms Pelosi accurately wrote this week that the current paradigm of trade policy is failing, but then bafflingly proposed a major role for the UN.
 
Such an idea can only be born out of ignorance or a disingenuous desire to prevent any more deals ever being signed. A system centred on the UN would outdo the WTO as the global epicentre of pointless gestures.
 
Whether or not fast-track authority, let alone the TPP, manages to sneak past Congress down a maze of procedural back corridors is unknown. But a controversial pact passed under such conditions will sour the atmosphere for any deals in the future.
 
The best way to pass trade policy is under the aegis of a revived WTO. The second best is for large regional or sectoral deals that focus on free trade rather than intellectual property rights, and are negotiated transparently. The current model of secrecy does no one any favours, and gives globalisation in general and trade deals in particular an unfairly bad name.
 


 
 
New twist offers hope for Obama to fast-track TPP

US House passes new version of law without tying it to aid package
 
UNITED States President Barack Obama's fading hopes of completing an ambitious free trade deal with Asia were rekindled in Congress, as the increasingly convoluted legislative saga on trade took yet another twist.
 
On Thursday, for the second time in a week, lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted to pass the controversial Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a law granting the President fast- track authority to negotiate trade deals.
 
But this time, they voted for a version of the Bill that had no ties to the workers' aid programme that was used to torpedo it last week. It passed by almost the same margin as it did a week earlier - 218 to 208 - with the same 28 Democrats voting for it.
 
The move puts the ball back in the Senate's court - the Senate must pass the House version of the TPA if it is to become law.
 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was confident that he would be able to get it through the Chamber.
 
"Assuming everyone has a little faith and votes the same way they just did a few weeks ago, we'll be able to get all of these Bills to the President soon."
 
On June 12, House Democrats successfully blocked progress by voting down the aid package - meant to help US workers displaced by free trade - paired with fast-track authority.
 
That left congressional leaders with a headache: How to reconcile the trade package approved by the Senate that tied fast track to workers' aid and a House version that has only fast track?
 
Both Chambers must pass the same version of the law before it can be signed by the President.
 
On Thursday - after a week of lobbying and legislative manoeuvring - they appear to have decided that it was better to gamble on the Senate than try to change the minds of more than 70 lawmakers in the House.
 
All attention will now be focused on the 14 pro-trade Democrats who supported the Senate version of the law last month. So far, it is unclear how many are willing to support the standalone measure despite assurances from congressional leaders that the workers' assistance package will be passed separately.
 
One of the 14, Senator Ron Wyden, told reporters that the group is looking for clearer assurance. "What the pro-trade Democrats are telling me is that much of what is being speculated on doesn't give them the assurance they need that both are actually going to happen."
 
The Senate is expected to vote on the Bill next week to try to get it passed before the July 4 recess.
 
And while there are few certainties given the many shocks so far, Washington pundits said they believe the President will soon have the authority he needs to conclude the 12-nation mega free trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
 
Mr Ernie Bower, senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said he is optimistic there are "sufficient numbers of Democrats in the Senate and House who understand that TPA and TPP are fundamentally important to US national security and our economy".
 
He said the embarrassment they caused to the President last week should appease some.
 
"Democrats felt hung out to dry by the White House because they believed the President was moving too fast without making the case and giving them cover. They've made their point and now have to focus on US national interests. The maths, destroyed by the political messaging to the President, is now back in order and TPA will pass as a result."
 
Mr Alex Sullivan, associate fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, agreed.
 
"Recent history has made betting against bipartisan comity in Congress a good business, but I'm hopeful in this case that lawmakers will do the right thing for the US economy and US international standing," he said.
 


 
 
Fate of TPP trade deal draws closer in the US

The fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade and investment pact may be known as early as next Wednesday, United States time, after a vote in Congress endorsed the elusive “fast-track authority” President Barack Obama needs if the 12-nation negotiation is to be concluded successfully.

But Groser indicated NZ might have to settle just for seeing dairy products included in the agreement.
 
“We can’t join TPP if it were to exclude dairy products, but I don’t for one minute believe that’s the issue.
 
“The issue is — how big a deal?”
 
Japan and Canada, who with the US are the biggest opponents to a dairy deal, have also said they will not negotiate TPP to a conclusion unless the US grants the President fast-track authority, thus preventing the US Congress from picking a multi-country deal apart on the floor of the House of Representatives.
 
TPP is widely politically opposed because of fears about its entrenchment of investor state dispute settlement provisions, allowing corporations to take Governments to quasi-legal arbitration if they object to policy changes, and its treatments in areas such as intellectual property and medical procurement.
 
“This is an open poker game ... and different chips are being put on the table ... [but] we’ve taken a very important step forward,” Groser said.
 
A successful Senate vote would “unlock the end game for the TPP”.
 
“The stakes are very high here for the United States,” he said. “Is the United States going to play a leadership role in global trade in the first quarter of the 21st century or not?”
 
Failure to secure fast-track, also known as TPA, would not only jeopardise TPP but also the US’ attempt to create a similar deal with the European Union, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.
 
Without fast-track authority, the US could “kiss goodbye” to TTIP.
 
While the 10-vote Congressional majority appeared slender, Groser said he had been assured by US Trade Representative Mike Froman that it had passed “comfortably”, with many Democrat members of the Congress voting tactically to oppose it to protect trade union support and funding in their own electorates.
 
“A game of chicken goes on, where people, who know that it’s strongly in the US’ national interest to support this international trade agenda, will vote against it when they can calculate that there are negative implications [for themselves],” Groser said.
 
Obama has argued a US failure on TPP risks ceding to its greatest geo-political rival, China, leadership on how trade rules are written in future.
 
Assuming a successful Senate vote, meetings between chief negotiators and a ministerial meeting would be required in the next six weeks, along with coming to a landing on a deal for dairy, Groser said.

Groser point man at key time in world trade
20 June 2015
The New Zealand Herald
 
Trade Minister Tim Groser has long been tipped by Wellington’s euphemistically labelled “beltway” to be New Zealand’s next ambassador to Washington.
 
The Beehive game plan was for Groser to shed his ministerial post once the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiation was concluded and head off to the United States to spearhead New Zealand’s presence in the world’s prime superpower.
 
This would place the “uber” diplomat doing what he does best on the international circuit and clear the way for another National Cabinet Minister to step into the trade portfolio, make the nuts and bolts deals to conclude outstanding free trade negotiations and deal with trade disruptions.
 
Suggestions have since emerged that Groser’s ambassadorial role will be twofold. The Wellington drum is that he will also remain involved with international climate change negotiations in a senior role representing New Zealand.
 
This would see Groser — who is expected to be posted to Washington this year — remain a player at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris in early December where nations will endeavour to negotiate a legally binding agreement to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 
It will also ensure that he remains in a bridging role between major interests at a time when regional geo-political power is in flux with China ready to insert itself as Asia-Pacific leader if the US drops the ball on TPP.
 
So far there has been no public confirmation from either the Prime Minister, Groser or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mfat) over the proposed plan.
 
There are now complicating factors.
 
Yesterday the TPP came another step closer when the US House of Representatives narrowly approved legislation to give President Barack Obama the authority to close the TPP deal. This after last week’s rejection of a comprehensive package which also included trade adjustment assistance which was a big slap in the face to Obama.
 
The trade promotion authority legislation must go back to the US Senate for ratification next week. But it could still come unstuck again if sufficient Democrats resist the White House’s arm-twisting and vote it down.
 
Groser makes it clear that the end game negotiations for TPP can’t get under way with any degree of certainty unless Obama has the authority to conclude the deal.
 
His view is shared by other Asia-Pacific trade ministers who do not want to waste their own precious negotiating capital to forge an agreement which could then end up being relitigated in Washington if Obama does not have the authority to conclude a deal which would be presented to Congress for a “yes” or “no” vote.
 
It is a pivotal time for world trade.
 
China had been preparing itself to seek accession to the TPP agreement. Chinese political leaders see the stringent business rules contained within the TPP negotiating platform as providing a useful mechanism to further help China’s transformation into a fully-fledged market economy.
 
The rival Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) — as currently conceived — does not provide that platform.
 
But Obama’s decision to openly try and get congressional votes by making TPP sound like a US-led containment measure for rising Chinese power has not gone down well in Beijing.
 
Groser is now predicting a global power shift if China emerges to fill the vacuum in the leadership of regional trade through the negotiations on the competing RCEP to which New Zealand is a participant but the United States is not.
 
China has already been increasing its regional power through the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to which New Zealand was the first founding Western member.
 
It has also signalled a desire to see the US dollar toppled from its perch as the global reserve currency.
 
All this calls for delicate footsteps as New Zealand tries to keep a foot in both camps.
 
Right now, the experienced senior diplomat Carl Worker has been deputed to Washington to stand in for current ambassador Mike Moore while he continues his recovery from a recent stroke. Moore is said to be making good progress.
 
Worker’s most recent post was as ambassador to China. But he is also a former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Americas Division and former member of the NZ US Council executive board. It is a testing time for New Zealand diplomacy.
 


 
 
 
Kazakhstan and EEU to finalize import duties harmonization in 6-7 year
19 June 2015
Interfax: Kazakhstan General Newswire
 
ST. PETERSBURG. June 19 (Interfax) - It takes Kazakhstan 6-7 years to harmonize its import duties with the other states participating in the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) after its joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), EEU Commission Minister for Trade Andrei Slepnev said on the sidelines of the St.Petersburg International Economic Forum.
 
Kazakhstan's commitments as a WTO member had been approved before the EEU was created and are lower than the import tariffs in Russia and the rest of EEU.
 
"During a certain period of time a number of tariffs applied in Kazakhstan will be lower than the EEU tariffs. In this connection, we need to figure our what necessary amendments we will have to make to our law and, most importantly, what regulatory mechanisms need to be in place to prevent these goods from coming into the rest of the Union," the minister said.
 
"There are different goods on that list. We do not have problems with some of them, for instance aircraft and even vehicles as these goods are to be registered. As far as the other goods are concerned, we are now developing control mechanisms including labelling. A pilot labeling project will be signed in July and we well launch it. Then, we will start harmonizing import operations in the framework of the WTO procedures. I think, this will take 6-7 years," Slepnev said.

TPP comes off life support, final US 'fast-track' approval possible next week
 
By Pattrick Smellie
 
June 19 (BusinessDesk) - The fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade and investment pact may be known as early as next Wednesday, US time, after a vote in the US Congress last night endorsed the elusive 'fast-track authority' that President Barack Obama needs if the 12 nation negotiation is to be concluded successfully.

"This will be a swirling mass," said Groser of the stage set for a Senate vote to endorse fast-track, perhaps as early as next Wednesday. "This is an open poker game going on and different chips are being put on the table. All I know is we've taken a very important step forward."

It would be a "big call" to get a dairy agreement within the available timeframe, but New Zealand would not support a TPP deal that did not include dairy.
 


 
 
 
After doubting, economists find China is killing US factory jobs
By Peter Gosselin and Mike Dorning   
Bloomberg News
19 June 2015
.   
 
WASHINGTON
 
A generation of economists trained to believe that trade had little to do with the long decline in high-paying U.S. factory jobs is changing its mind.
 
Their findings are likely to fuel the opposition within President Barack Obama’s own Democratic Party to his proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and similar pacts lowering barriers to international commerce.
 
Because manufacturing employment as a share of the workforce has been dropping for more than 40 years and the same trend has affected other developed nations, including Japan, with far less liberal trade policies than the U.S., many economists had concluded that automation was the primary culprit.
 
But studies examining the effect of China’s entry to the World Trade Organization in late 2001 have made the case that between 1 million and more than 2 million of the 5 million American factory jobs lost since 2000 are traceable to low-cost imports.
 
“The ‘aha' moment,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor, “was when we traced through the industries in which China had surging exports to the local addresses of their U.S. competitors and saw the powerful correspondence between where China had surged and where U.S. manufacturing employment had collapsed.”
 
Democrats last week blocked fast-track trade-negotiating authority for Obama, though House Republicans Thursday passed alternative legislation to try to revive it.
 
Democrats and their allies in organized labor argue that trade deals kill jobs supporting a strong blue-collar middle class without providing offsetting benefits. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said such agreements have “cost millions of jobs.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said trade accords have “let subsidized manufacturers around the globe sell here in America while good American jobs get shipped overseas.”
 
Their Exhibit A has been the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they say caused the exodus of hundreds of thousands of U.S. factory jobs to Mexico. But government statistics show that U.S. manufacturing employment actually rose during the five years after NAFTA took effect in 1994, temporarily reversing the long-term decline. An April 16 study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded that NAFTA “did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics.”
 
China is another matter.
 
In an April paper, economists Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott of Yale University found that the biggest U.S. manufacturing employment declines and largest surges in imports were in products for which China permanently locked in the greatest reductions in tariffs as part of its entry to the WTO. Industries such as apparel, leather goods, plastic plumbing fixtures and surgical and medical equipment sustained substantial hits, they concluded.
 
“Something big happens” around the time China entered the WTO, Schott said. “In fact, in the industries that were more affected, that’s where you see the job loss occurring.
 
“That’s the smoking gun for the link with the policy,” he said.
 
Autor and two co-authors wrote a 2013 paper estimating that between 2000 and 2007 the U.S. lost 982,000 manufacturing jobs because of Chinese import competition.
 
Autor and his colleagues said imports from China and other countries caused one-quarter of all U.S. manufacturing job losses during the period. He said in an interview that the estimate was conservative and that trade might be responsible for half the effect.
 
Despite his findings, Autor supports the Pacific-rim trade deal. He co-wrote an op-ed column in The Washington Post saying that the lost factory jobs aren’t coming back and that the deal would help the U.S. in areas such as intellectual property, where it enjoys a competitive advantage. The column said the agreement would also put pressure on China to stop gaming the global trade system.
 
Before the recent studies, most economists had concluded that something besides trade must be at work in the job losses. They settled on the growing role of automation. They argued that what’s happening in manufacturing in the U.S. and other developed nations is similar to what occurred in agriculture, where industrial techniques allowed farmers to produce much more with a fraction of the workers.
 
Federal Reserve data back up the critical role of automation in long-run trends: Output per factory worker more than quadrupled from 1970 to 2010, a phenomenon driven by everything from the replacement of people with machines to making work processes more efficient.
 
As recently as 1980, 1 in 5 American workers was employed in manufacturing; the number today is 1 in 12.
 
A study by McKinsey & Co. found that before U.S. ports started using cargo containers and massive cranes, a dock worker could move 1.7 tons of cargo per hour. Five years later, the worker could move 30 tons.
 
 
 
 
 
Congress's fast track to discord on free trade
19 June 2015

Congress last week blocked the "fast-track" trade promotion authority (TPA) that would have given President Barack Obama the power to submit trade deals, notably the forthcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to a yes-no vote on Capitol Hill.

TPP comes off life support, final US 'fast-track' approval possible next week
 
June 19 (BusinessDesk) - The fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade and investment pact may be known as early as next Wednesday, US time, after a vote in the US Congress last night endorsed the elusive 'fast-track authority' that President Barack Obama needs if the 12 nation negotiation is to be concluded successfully.
 
However, the next few days will be a "swirling mass", says New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser, who concedes that even if a Senate vote, probably as early as next Wednesday, confirms 'fast-track', New Zealand has yet to see its most important sector, the dairy industry, formally included in the agreement. TPP promises to tie together some 40 percent of world trade and would represent New Zealand's first free trade agreements with three of the world's largest and most agriculturally protected economies: Japan, the United States and Canada.
 
However, Groser indicated that New Zealand might have to settle just for seeing dairy products included in the agreement.
 
"We can't join TPP if it were to exclude dairy products, but I don't for one minute believe that's the issue," Groser told BusinessDesk. "The issue is: how big a deal?"
 
Japan and Canada, the biggest opponents to a dairy deal along with the US, have also said they will not negotiate TPP to a conclusion unless the US grants the president fast-track authority, thus preventing the US Congress from picking a multi-country deal apart on the floor of the House of Representatives.
 
TPP is widely politically opposed because of fears about its entrenchment of investor state dispute settlement provisions, allowing corporations to take governments to quasi-legal arbitration if they object to policy changes, and its treatments in areas such as intellectual property and medical procurement.
 
"This will be a swirling mass," said Groser of the stage set for a Senate vote to endorse fast-track, perhaps as early as next Wednesday. "This is an open poker game going on and different chips are being put on the table. All I know is we've taken a very important step forward."
 
A successful Senate vote would "unlock the end game for the TPP."
 
"The stakes are very high here for the United States," said Groser. "Is the United States going to play a leadership role in global trade in the first quarter of the 21st century or not?"
 
Failure to secure fast-track, also known as TPA, would not only jeopardise TPP but also the US's attempt to create a similar deal with the European Union, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP
 
Without fast-track authority, the US could "kiss goodbye" to TTIP.
 
While the 10-vote Congressional majority appeared slender, Groser said he had been assured by email from US Trade Representative Mike Froman overnight that it had passed "comfortably", with many Democrat members of the Congress voting tactically to oppose it to protect trade union support and funding in their own electorates.
 
"A game of chicken goes on, where people, who know that it's strongly in the US's national interest to support this international trade agenda, will vote against it when they can calculate that there are negative implications (for themselves)," said Groser.
 
Obama has argued a US failure by on TPP risks ceding to its greatest geo-political rival, China, leadership on how trade rules are written in the future.
 
Assuming a successful Senate vote, meetings between chief negotiators and a ministerial meeting would be required in the next six weeks, along with coming to a landing on a deal for dairy, Groser said. Negotiators will want to avoid the talks sliding into the American summer holidays in August and September, with the political pressure of the 2016 US presidential election looming large as a stumbling block to ongoing progress.
 
Groser said that from New Zealand's perspective, there was now "a very good deal on everything but dairy products."
 
"It's not to say that there's a bad deal on dairy products, it's more to say that there's no deal. We've barely started. Phony negotiating positions have been put on the table but that doesn't help a professional negotiator make a judgement as to where the landing zone is.
 
It would be a "big call" to get a dairy agreement within the available timeframe, but New Zealand would not support a TPP deal that did not include dairy.
 


 
 
 
Talks begin on ambitious agreement to free up global wheat trade

Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News
 
Major grain importing and exporting nations have started talks on an ambitious agreement to free up the global wheat trade.
 
Meeting in Geneva, delegates from around the world discussed the Wheat Sectoral Global Food Security Initiative, to tackle issues of domestic subsidies, market access and export competition.
 
Cheryl Kalisch Gordon, manager of trade and market access with GrainGrowers, said the Australian industry group had given in-principle support to the initiative, which she said could finally overcome the hurdle local growers face competing with countries that are heavily subsidised.
 
"The key issues really get back to domestic support for wheat in other countries, including the United States, Canada and the EU," Dr Kalisch Gordon said.
 
"There's also great amounts of support and increasing in China and in India. However, these are smaller export countries so it doesn't have the same level of competition in our export markets.
 
"We're competing at the real cost of production. Those guys (US, Canada and EU) have a buffer, so their real cost of production is much higher than the net price that they are really paying to produce the same wheat.
 
"For Australia, we will be pushing hard on reduced domestic support (for other countries)."
 
Dr Kalisch Gordon said Australia would also seek strong biosecurity measures in any negotiations on the initiative.
 
"(We want) assurance that biosecurity won't be compromised, but also that biosecurity measures aren't used by importing countries to replace tariffs. We are seeing a real trend in that internationally where tariffs come down, but quasi-trade restrictions, by way of technical barriers, start to pop up," she said.
 
Tony Russell, executive manager of the Grain Industry Market Access Forum, which works to improve market access for Australian growers, said trade reform was long overdue.
 
"It's been rather a struggle to see broad reform taking place under WTO (World Trade Organisation) and this initiative just looks at it from a different perspective and may provide another angle to achieve trade reform," he said.
 
"Ultimately any agreement aims to remove trade distorting measures, whether they be export subsidies, domestic support subsidies, or just being able to gain market access into markets because you're impacted by tariffs, or other non-tariff barriers to trade.
 
"An agreement like this is focussed on removing as many trade barriers as possible, such that trade freely flows from point of most efficient production to end use."
 


 
 
 
House passes 'fast track' trade bill ; Backers hope to round up 60 to support it in Senate
Susan Davis, USA TODAY
19 June 2015
.   
 
The U.S. House narrowly approved, 218-208, a six-year renewal of trade promotion authority in an ongoing effort to revive President Obama's trade agenda in the face of stiff Democratic opposition.
 
Republicans, working closely with the White House, are executing a new strategy to pass the authority, also known as TPA or "fast track," as well as trade adjustment assistance (TAA), an aid program for displaced workers.
 
Last week, House Democrats voted down TAA, a program they historically support, in a strategy to derail fast track. The two bills' fates were linked because they passed as one piece of legislation in the Senate last month.
 
House Republicans will send the fast track bill back to the Senate, where supporters hope they can muster the 60 votes necessary to pass it as a stand-alone measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, pledged to bring trade adjustment assistance back to the floor soon after fast track passes.
 
McConnell said the Senate would vote early next week on the TPA, then TAA. "Assuming everyone has a little faith and votes the same way they just did a few weeks ago, we'll be able to get all of these bills to the president soon," he said.
 
The White House is eager to enact TPA because it provides an expedited process to get trade bills through Congress, allowing them only to be approved or rejected, not amended. Obama has made trade a significant focus of his foreign policy legacy in his final months in office. He met privately Wednesday with Democrats who support his trade agenda to shore up votes. Supporters want to wrap up the trade debate before Congress adjourns for the July 4 week-long recess.
 
Separating the two bills is intended to renew pressure on House Democrats, who could be faced with a worst-case scenario of reauthorizing fast track with adjustment assistance set to expire Sept. 30. The risky maneuver relies heavily on Democrats trusting GOP leaders to keep their word to pass TAA.
 
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who joined the majority of House Democrats in voting down the trade bill last week, said Thursday she did not see a path forward for TAA. "I don't think so, no," she said, dismissing questions about frayed Democratic relations with the White House.
 
"We have a deep relationship of trust with the president," she said.
 
Liberal groups threatened to hold Democrats accountable at the ballot box if they support the latest gambit.
 
"Any Democrat in Congress who trusts John Boehner or Mitch McConnell to pass trade adjustment assistance that will actually help working families deserves to lose their job," said Jim Dean, chair of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America.
 


 
 
 
New life for Obama’s trade agenda
By Paul Kane;Mike DeBonis   
19 June 2015
Washington Post.com
 
The House resurrected the centerpiece of President Obama's trade agenda Thursday, six days after his fellow Democrats dealt him a dramatic setback that spurned a months-long lobbying effort on the president's part.
 
Thursday's 218-to-208 vote to grant Obama "fast track" authority to negotiate trade deals — including the controversial 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership — is a win for the president, but it is not yet a victory.
 
It is the first in a complicated series of moves to get around a blockade set up by liberal House Democrats against the president's trade agenda.
 
The original plan was complicated enough — four separate bills, two of them packaged in one piece for the Senate, but then split apart for House consideration into four votes. Since that initial path blew up last week, Obama's supporters have crafted an exponentially more difficult bridge to revive and approve the trade legislation.
 
"This is a 60-yard field goal, into the wind. So, good luck, it may work," said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a deep skeptic of the new process who nevertheless supports the effort. "You're trying to create a cocktail here with a little margin for error, no margin for error. But, anyway, I'm willing to give it a whirl."
 
Said House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) shortly before the vote: "I'm confident that we're in a pretty good place."
 
The prospects for success hinge on a commodity that is on the verge of extinction in Washington these days: trust.
 
Republicans must trust Democrats, and Democrats must trust Democrats, and most of all they must put their faith in Obama to back up his commitments made in the past week.
 
"Trust, trust is the key; you got it, trust," Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the most ardent Democratic supporter of the trade agenda, said Wednesday before meeting with the president. "Trust rules the day. A lack thereof destroys it."
 
By Thursday afternoon, the first moves had been made to begin the trust-building exercises. The House vote was nearly identical to last week's roll call on the fast-track measure, as the same 28 Democrats who support Obama's trade measures linked arms with 190 Republicans to approve the plan and send it to the Senate. There, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to set up key votes early next week.
 
If supporters of the trade agenda are successful, Congress will approve — possibly all next week — the fast-track legislation, also known as Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, that sets specific time limits for the consideration of trade deals; funding for retraining workers who have lost their jobs because of global competition, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA; and a bill extending existing trade preference agreements.
 
Some House Democrats remain deeply opposed to the emerging effort to get around their opposition, believing expanded trade often leads to U.S. job losses and depressed wages because corporations search for cheaper labor overseas.
 
"Same result as the Titanic, I'd say," Rep. Xavier Becerra (Calif.), the No. 4 House Democratic leader, predicted of the new strategy, likening it to a "reshuffling" of the furniture on the ill-fated ship.
 
Becerra was one of more than 140 House Democrats who upended the original plan for advancing the trade agenda. After the Senate approved the legislation last month, Boehner set up a complex plan for approving Obama's initiatives in the House so that Republicans could vote for pieces that they believed in and Democrats could support the parts they ideologically believed in.
 
One bill, reauthorizing the African Growth and Opportunity Act and other existing trade preference accords, won overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate, the piece of the puzzle that seemed to have the clearest shot into law.
 
The new fast-track-only bill is likely to win approval next week in the Senate, if more than dozen Democrats there put their faith in Boehner and House Democrats.
 
Last week, on the vote to reauthorize TAA, the worker program, a vast majority of Democrats backed off their support for that funding so they could stall the entire bill.
 
Since that vote, 40 Democrats and Obama have spent several days in constant phone calls and meetings with Republicans building a new plan to win approval for each piece, because most pro-trade Democrats demand money for worker retraining in exchange for fast-track authority.
 
"We're as clear as we can be: TAA and TPA both need to pass. We'll see what happens and what the House does, and hopefully everybody will come to their senses," said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), a trusted negotiator among the competing factions.
 
To meet Murray's demand, McConnell would take the popular African trade bill — which needs to be considered again by the Senate — and amend it to include the worker-training funds and send it back to the House.
 
Among the 14 Senate Democrats who have already voted for fast-track, there is deep doubt that House Democrats will come around to voting for legislation that they support.
 
"I don't think there's any bankable guarantees in this building right now," said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a supporter of Obama's trade agenda who has also been the Senate's main supporter of the African trade bill, AGOA. "My hope is that AGOA is not collateral damage in what is a pretty fundamental fight over trade policy."
 
Some pro-trade Democrats believe Obama may have to actually sign the fast-track authority bill for liberal Democrats to face a take-it-or-leave-it offer to get both the African trade promotion and TAA bills.
 
"It is going to be hard to see votes switch. At some point there is going have to be some ­de-linkage there and the Democrats need to come home and protect the program that we've fought for for years," said Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a leader of pro-trade New Democratic Coalition.
 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski ­(R-Alaska), a supporter of every piece of Obama's trade agenda, said her daily exercise includes being "ever the optimist" that Congress will move past the ideological divides to get things done despite the intense efforts in some corners.
 
"I want to believe every day there's some little building block," Murkowski said. "That's what we're working on — trust, that five-letter word."
 


 
 
 
 
House Passes Fast-Track Trade Bill, but Senate Outcome Uncertain; Revised bill to expand Obama’s trade-negotiating authority moves back to Senate
By Siobhan Hughes   
19 June 2015
The Wall Street Journal Online
 
WASHINGTON—The House passed legislation Thursday to ease trade pacts through Congress, as Republicans and some Democrats revived hopes for President Barack Obama's trade agenda less than a week after liberals sank a similar bill.
 
The House's 218-208 vote sends the measure to the Senate where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) wants to pass the bill as soon as next week. Fast-track authority would give Mr. Obama the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote, without amendments.
 
But the bill's fate is intertwined with a related measure to help workers hurt by international trade. Many pro-trade Senate Democrats say they won't vote for the fast-track bill without evidence that the worker-aid program, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, will pass both chambers.
 
House and Senate Republican leaders have committed to separately passing the workers' assistance extension. Late Thursday, Mr. McConnell said that passage of the fast-track bill was within striking distance, but that it would take “trusting each other to get there."
 
But Democrats are anxious about whether GOP leaders can deliver. They see the package as four parts: Fast-track, the workers assistance, a separate enforcement measure that would give the U.S. stronger tools to combat against unfair trading practices and one to extend trade preferences with sub-Saharan African nations.
 
Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said he and other pro-trade Democratic senators want to make sure all four items get enacted.
 
Labor unions and allied groups of the left vowed to pressure Senate Democrats to oppose fast track, saying the battle isn't over yet. “If it weren't for this massive corporate coalition and all their power and money, this whole trade agenda would be sitting on a curb someplace," said Lori Wallach, senior trade expert at Public Citizen, which has been fighting the trade bill.
 
Business groups encouraged the Senate to pass the fast-track bill, noting that it already passed an earlier version last month that was connected to the worker-aid program. “We now call on the U.S. Senate to once again reaffirm its commitment," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue.
 
The next critical moment comes early next week. Senate fast-track supporters would need to line up 60 votes to get around a procedural hurdle before passing the bill. That is an open question because some of the 14 pro-trade Democrats are wavering. Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) said Thursday that he wants all four bills to pass together instead of one by one.
 
Mr. McConnell made clear that wouldn't happen, saying Thursday that a vote on the fast-track bill would come first, followed by a vote on the trade preferences bill. Mr. McConnell said that the workers-aid program would be attached to the trade preferences bill. He promised that Republican votes would “be there to pass" the worker-aid measure—“reluctantly, not happily, but they will be there if it means getting something far more important accomplished for the American people."
 
In May, 14 Democrats joined 48 Republicans to pass, 62-37, the fast-track bill, formally known as Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA.
 
Mr. Obama has long pushed for fast-track authority, which many past presidents have had. The power is seen as necessary to wrap up a 12-nation trade pact among countries around the Pacific Rim and possibly, later, a pact with European nations.
 
Talks over the Pacific accord are nearly complete but have come to a standstill because U.S. trading partners are unwilling to make their best, final offers until Congress signals it is on board with the talks and won't amend any agreement.
 
House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), sank the fast-track package last week by voting against a key component which would extend the program to help workers hurt by foreign competition. In response, House Republican leaders stripped out that portion of the bill.
 
Instead, House Republicans brought a stand-alone fast-track measure to the floor Thursday; it received the support of 190 Republicans and 28 Democrats. The vote showed the staying power of the 28 pro-trade Democrats, who also voted for fast-track authority last week, when the trade-negotiating power was part of the larger measure.
 
Even with the leaders' commitments however, supporters of TAA are concerned that Republicans, who are in the majority in both chambers, would oppose it. Many Republicans call the program an inefficient form of government welfare, and persuading Republicans in both chambers to support it could present a challenge.
 
Rep. Jim Himes, a pro-trade Democrat from Connecticut who met Wednesday with Mr. Obama, said the president said he would sign the fast-track bill into law before Congress had passed a bill to renew the workers' aid program.
 
While such a move would put pressure on House Democrats to reverse course and vote for a workers' aid program they had previously voted against to scuttle the fast-track bill, the action could cut both ways. Some pro-trade Senate Democrats could withhold their support for the fast-track bill if they thought Mr. Obama was giving up his leverage to force passage of the assistance program.
 
“I can't predict that," Mrs. Pelosi said on Thursday when asked if she thought both the fast-track bill and the Trade Adjustment Assistance, also known as TAA, would pass. “I don't see a path right now for TAA."
 
The passage of a narrower fast-track bill through the House itself depended on the willingness of the small group of pro-trade Democrats to trust that Mr. McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) can fulfill their promise to find a way to separately renew the workers' aid program. Mr. Obama, who has closely coordinated with the two Republicans, worked this week to build that trust, meeting with pro-trade Democrats to convince them there was a separate path for the renewal of TAA, which expires at the end of September.
 
“The only legislative strategy that the president will support is a strategy that results in both TPA and TAA coming to his desk," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday. “There are a variety of ways to do that."
 
Liberal groups weren't convinced, and one outlined plans to take revenge on Democrats who voted for the fast-track bill. “Any Democrat in Congress who trusts John Boehner or Mitch McConnell to pass Trade Adjustment Assistance, that will actually help working families, deserves to lose their job," said Jim Dean, the chair of Democracy for America, in a statement. “Whether it's this election cycle or election cycles to come, Democracy for America will actively search for opportunities to make sure they lose their jobs and are replaced with real Democrats committed to fighting growing income inequality, not enabling it."
 
 
Le Canada s’attaque aux USA via le tribunal de l’OMC
18 June 2015
Sputnik France
 
Le tribunal d'arbitrage de l'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC) va examiner la demande du Canada d'appliquer des sanctions estimées à 2,5 milliards de dollars chaque année contre les Etats-Unis pour violation des règles de l'OMC, annonce l'agence Rossiya Segodnya.
 
"Lors d'une réunion spéciale de l'Organe de règlement des différends de l'OMC, le Canada a demandé officiellement auprès de l'OMC des sanctions sous forme de mesures tarifaires contre les États-Unis en réponse au non-respect continu par les États-Unis de leurs obligations dans le cadre de l'OMC", a confié à Rossiya Segodnya une source proche de l'affaire.
 
Il s'agit d'un litige commercial concernant une loi appelée COOL, qui exige un étiquetage du pays d'origine.
 
Le Canada et le Mexique avaient affirmé que l'exigence de mentionner le pays d'origine dans l'étiquetage de certains produits, notamment la viande bovine, découlant de l'adoption en 2009 par les États-Unis d'une nouvelle réglementation, lésait leurs éleveurs bovins et porcins. Ils avaient alors porté plainte à l'OMC qui a finalement abouti.
 
"Les États-Unis ont utilisé et épuisé tous les recours possibles pour contourner leurs obligations internationales, causant du tort à la chaîne d'approvisionnement hautement intégrée d'Amérique du Nord, ainsi qu'aux producteurs et aux transformateurs de part et d'autre de la frontière", explique le ministre du Commerce canadien, Ed Fast.
 
"Les Etats-Unis ne sont pourtant pas d'accord avec la somme fixée et se sont donc adressés à l'arbitrage", a précisé la source.
 
"Aujourd'hui, le Canada a déclaré qu'il était terriblement déçu que les États-Unis maintiennent cette mesure discriminatoire qui s'oppose aux obligations des Etats-Unis au sein de l'OMC", ajoute-t-on de même source.
 
Selon le représentant du Canada, la somme réclamée est équivalente aux pertes annuelles du pays provoquées par la loi COOL.
 
 


 
Chine : les tarifs douaniers seront stables après la période de transition de l'OMC
18 June 2015
 
BEIJING, 18 juin (Xinhua) -- Le niveau général des tarifs douaniers à l'importation sera stable après la fin de la période de transition de quinze ans de l'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC), a annoncé jeudi le ministère du Commerce.
 
Depuis l'entrée de la Chine à l'OMC en 2001, le pays a franchi des étapes concrètes pour diminuer les tarifs douaniers. En 2010, le niveau global des tarifs douaniers de la Chine avait diminué de 9,8% contre 15,3%, a indiqué le porte-parole du ministère Shen Danyang.
 
"Cela signifie qu'en 2010, les engagements de la Chine concernant la réduction des tarifs douaniers ont été globalement tenus", a indiqué M. Shen.
 
Ces remarques ont été faites suite à des informations selon lesquelles les tarifs douaniers à l'importation baisseraient fortement à la fin de la période de transition qui tombera cette année en juillet.

Le commerce mondial a du mal à sortir de son état léthargique
Guy Marchal   
18 June 2015
L'AGEFI Hebdo
 
Les difficultés économiques rencontrées par les pays émergents ralentissent les échanges de marchandises.
 
Quand la Chine s’endormira… le commerce mondial en pâtira. Le changement de modèle de l’économie chinoise, axé désormais sur la demande intérieure et la consommation et n’étant plus uniquement « l’atelier du monde », se lit à livre ouvert dans les statistiques des échanges mondiaux de marchandises. En avril, l’OMC* a livré une troisième estimation de la croissance du commerce pour 2015, revue une nouvelle fois à la baisse : de 5,3 % à 3,3 % pour 2015 et 4 % pour 2016. En 2014, les échanges commerciaux ont crû de 2,8 % pour une prévision de l’OMC à l’origine de 4,7 %. C’est mieux que la progression moyenne de ces trois dernières années évaluée à 2 % l’an par la Cnuced**. C’est beaucoup moins que la croissance moyenne des deux décennies qui ont précédé la crise économique de 2008 de 6,8 % l’an. Les heures de gloire de la mondialisation débridée semblent appartenir au passé.Le ralentissement de la croissance économique mondiale est la principale explication à ce coup de frein ; les économies émergentes, et principalement la Chine, pesant de tout leur poids dans ce ralentissement. Les économistes de la banque centrale (Banque populaire de Chine) en prennent acte dans leurs nouvelles prévisions de juin et diminuent la progression des exportations attendue cette année à 2,5 %, contre 6,5 % auparavant. Les anticipations pour les importations font carrément la culbute avec une contraction de 4,2 % contre une hausse de 5,1 % prévue précédemment. La Banque mondiale enfonce le clou avec ses nouvelles prévisions. Elle s’attend à une croissance mondiale de seulement 2,8 %, avec un ralentissement marqué des pays émergents exportateurs de produits de base.La structure des échanges modifiéeAu mois le mois, le freinage des échanges se voit au travers des indicateurs habituels comme le Baltic Dry Index ou le CPB (du Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis). L’indice CBP momentum (lissé) du début d’année montre une contraction des échanges commerciaux, « un déclin plus prononcé dans les économies émergentes que dans les économies développées ». Quant au Baltic Dry Index (BDI) qui collecte les données sur le fret maritime en vrac des produits de base, il a touché un plus bas historique. Le résultat du BDI est à relativiser, car si l’indice collait parfaitement au développement des échanges des premières heures de la vague de mondialisation des années 2000, il a beaucoup perdu de sa pertinence aujourd’hui.Le monde émergent à la peine, « la croissance des échanges de marchandises à court terme repose sur les économies développées », explique le rapport semestriel HSBC Trade Forecast pour qui le commerce international de marchandises parviendra à retrouver un rythme de croissance de 8 % à partir de 2017 « grâce à une accélération des échanges sud-sud », qui devraient être stimulés par des traités de libéralisation des échanges. Dans un premier temps, ce scénario des économistes de HSBC repose sur une accélération du commerce mondial dû à un euro plus faible et à la reprise économique en zone euro, « qui compte pour un quart du commerce mondial et dont les difficultés avaient, ces dernières années, freiné l’expansion des échanges ». Une explication aux tristes années 2012-2014 est la relocalisation d’activités industrielles. L’étude HSBC met en avant le raccourcissement progressif de la chaîne logistique mondiale, phénomène causé par la tendance au rapatriement de la production qui se traduit par une circulation transfrontière réduite des produits manufacturés intermédiaires. Pour la banque, des accords de libéralisation devraient stimuler le commerce : le TFA (trade facilitation agreement) proposé par l’OMC et le TTIP (transatlantic trade & investment partnership) Europe-Etats-Unis, sujet à controverses et à débats houleux.La structure des échanges se modifie, les exportations de produits TIC (technologies de l’information et de la communication) ne cessent de monter en puissance depuis le début du siècle. La valeur des exportations de TIC est aujourd’hui de 1.400 milliards de dollars, soit 10 % du total mondial. Il pèse plus que le secteur agricole. Une nouvelle vague de libéralisation des TIC concernant 200 produits supplémentaires, de nouvelle génération ou à usage médical, est attendue. Elle devrait permettre, selon HSBC, de soutenir le commerce mondial et à la Chine de réaliser 44 % des exportations de produits TIC d’ici 2030.*Organisation mondiale du commerce.**Conférence des Nations unies pour le commerce et le développement.
