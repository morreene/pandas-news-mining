Farm subsidies: India stands its ground against US proposal 
D Ravi Kanth, Mint, Geneva, Sept. 25 -- India is standing its ground against a proposal by the US seeking voluntary reduction commitments in market price support programmes and input subsidies provided to low-income and resource-poor farmers by governments, insisting it will amount to killing public stockholding programmes. Last week, the US circulated a non-paper at a meeting attended by trade officials. Those from the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" European Union (EU), China, India, Brazil, Australia, Japan and the US were in attendance. Washington proposed that all members of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) undertake voluntary commitments to reduce their market price support and input subsidy programmes. Although developing countries are exempted from commitments to reduce their market price support or input subsidies for "low-income and resource-poor farmers" under the existing HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO rules, the US proposed a gradual phase-out of these two schemes in its non-paper. A non-paper is a discussion paper that does not necessarily represent the official position of the institution or country that drafted it. On Wednesday, the chair for the Doha agriculture negotiations, Vangelis Vitalis of New Zealand, convened the meeting of select trade envoys from over two dozen countries to discuss the way forward for the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO's ministerial meeting in Nairobi, beginning on 15 December. At the meeting, the US spoke about its proposal and what it intends to accomplish in reducing trade-distorting domestic farm subsidies. The proposal states that "each member shall, with respect to agricultural products undertake commitment(s)" not to increase either "the applied administrative price for any agricultural product receiving market price support" or "not increase its budgetary outlays for, or the scope of, product-specific input subsidies for agricultural products above the (existing) level". The US provided a menu of options as to how members must undertake commitments to do away with market price support and input subsidies such as "a) fertilizer, b) seeds, c) electricity, or d) diesel fuel". Deputy US trade envoy Christopher Wilson justified the proposal on the ground that "certain forms of domestic support (such as market price support and input subsidies) are more trade distorting than others", according to a participant in the meeting. The US official maintained that Washington's idea to reduce market price support and input subsidies on a voluntary basis by all members will lead to less distortion in agriculture. According to people familiar with the meeting, India's trade envoy Anjali Prasad responded by saying the US's proposal "kills many birds with one shot and among the birds one big bird is public stock-holding programmes". The Indian stand is that the US proposal is targeted at specific programmes offered by developing countries for their resource-poor farmers under what is called de minimis (negligible) subsidies.
China flatly rejected Washington's proposal saying it is "politically and economically unacceptable". The landing zones for commitments in trade-distorting domestic support are clearly laid out in the 2008 revised draft modalities or the Rev. 4 and they remain the basis for undertaking commitments in the domestic support pillar, China's trade envoy, ambassador Yu Jianhua, said. Many other countries such as Mexico, Canada, Australia, Norway, the EU, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay, among others, raised several questions and doubts about the US' proposal and whether it would tackle all trade-distorting domestic subsidies. At issue is the US's refusal to accept the Rev. 4 commitments under which Washington is required to reduce its trade-distorting domestic subsidies below $14.5 billion. Washington had passed a new farm bill last year under which its overall trade-distorting subsidy programmes crossed all the limits that were negotiated in the Doha Round. Former US chief trade negotiator Joseph Glauber, along with Patrick Westhoff and Scott Gerit, have argued that the latest US farm bill, passed last year, goes beyond the proposed commitments in the 2008 modalities. "Because of the shift to a much more extensive reliance on amber box (most trade distorting) subsidies and other less direct forms of income transfers to farmers, the 2014 farm bill has complicated trade negotiations by making compliance issues more problematic, especially in the context of the 2008 Doha Development Agenda proposal for substantially lower limits on farm subsidies," Wethoff, Gerit, and Glauber wrote in their article published in Choice magazine. Given the stark domestic realities in which the US's farm lobby plays a dominant role in American politics, the US is unwilling to undertake any commitments in terms of domestic support and is determined to bury the Doha Round at the Nairobi meeting, said a trade envoy who asked not to be quoted. The US's proposal strikes a body blow to what was negotiated in the ongoing Doha agriculture talks, especially the July 2004 Framework Agreement, the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration and the unsettled 2008 revised draft modalities. The developing countries are exempted from undertaking any commitments under these ministerial declarations as well as the 2008 revised draft modal.

TPP could be sealed next week 
Dow Jones newswires, Business Spectator – Online, 25 September 2015 -- Talks on a giant Pacific trade deal to heat up in Atlanta amid hopes for an agreement. Senior officials from the US, Japan, and 10 other countries around the Pacific, including Australia, will meet next week in Atlanta in another attempt to finish a wide-ranging trade agreement designed to lower border barriers and boost economic growth. The previous high-level negotiations, two months ago on Hawaii's island of Maui, ended without a deal, with the talks souring over the dairy trade, automotive manufacturing and intellectual-property protection for drugs. The failure to reach an agreement in Maui pushed the efforts to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, deep into political campaign seasons in Canada and the US. "Trade ministers and negotiators last met in July and have been making good progress toward resolving the limited number of outstanding issues, " the US trade representative's office said in a statement. Top negotiators will gather Saturday in Atlanta, with trade ministers joining them on Wednesday in another effort to strike a deal, according to the statement. President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Barack Obama for years has touted the TPP as a key economic legacy and part of his administration's effort to rebalance foreign policy toward fast-growing economies in Asia. The talks don't include China, whose economic system is considered to be at a different stage of development. And Mr Obama has said the TPP would introduce American-style rules of the road to as an alternative to lax Chinese commercial rules in the region. Most congressional Democrats, backed by labour groups, oppose Mr Obama's trade policy, but most Republicans voted this summer in support of legislation that would expedite passage of the TPP, if the countries reach a deal. Since then, the 2016 election season has started weighing on American political support for the deal. Hillary Clinton, who backed the talks as secretary of state, has withheld full support for the TPP in recent months. While Canadian Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Stephen Harper strongly backed the deal last week in a debate, his prospects in the country's October elections are unclear. Officials from the big auto-producing countries in the talks -- the US, Japan, Canada and Mexico -- met recently to work out a disagreement about how much of a car has to be made within the 12-nation bloc in order for it to be traded duty-free. An official familiar with those talks in San Francisco said they were productive and notched some progress. Unions and firms involved in Detroit auto production are concerned. "This is a lot of jobs, and we need our government to recognise the value of those jobs and take a firm line," Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" AFL-CIO, the biggest US labour alliance, said. "There is danger, in the final days of negotiations, that a bad deal will be cut" on automobile rules. One of the bitterest fights is over trade in dairy products, the number one export of New Zealand, which is a founding member of the talks. Canadian officials are reluctant to dismantle a complicated system that protects the country's dairy farmers but limits imports and raises prices for consumers. The US and Japan also are seeking to avoid stiffening the competition for their dairy farmers through the TPP. Probably the most expensive fight is over the duration of intellectual-property protection for biologic drugs, with the US seeking up to 12 years of protection for name-brand biologics against generic imitators. Backers of the US position say the protections are necessary to help drug companies pay for expensive research and development, but many Democrats and humanitarian organisations support fewer years of protection to boost the drugs' affordability. If ministers reach a deal in Atlanta, Congress wouldn't be able to bring the TPP to an up-or-down vote until at least early 2016, given built-in delays in the "fast track" legislation passed this summer. With some Republican presidential candidates openly sceptical of Obama's trade negotiations, passage in 2016 could prove difficult, even though most Republicans voted for special trade authority for Mr Obama several months ago. "We should not assume, though, that because the authority was done, that we automatically are going to be able to get TPP done" in Congress, Mr Obama told the Business Roundtable, a group representing top business executives, last week. "Within the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Republican Party, some of the same impulses that are anti-immigration reform, some of the same impulses that see the entire world as a threat and we've got to wall ourselves off, some of those same impulses also start creeping into the trade debate."
 
Greenpeace asks Modi to challenge Obama on climate change 
BS Reporter New Delhi, Business Standard, 25 September 2015 -- In an open letter to Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Narendra Modi, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace International and its India office has asked him to urge President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Barack Obama to reconsider US’ case at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization (HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO) against India’s solar policy, which puts domestic content restrictions. The prime minister is currently visiting the US. The letter asked Modi to raise concerns over US’ plans for offshore drilling in the deep seas of the Arctic. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace heads also asked the PM to tell Obama to discontinue subsidies to fossil fuels. The joint letter says, “We congratulate you on setting new and ambitious renewable energy targets for India, and urge a focus on decentralised renewable energy as the fastest, most cost-effective way to tackle India’s energy poverty challenge.” At the same time, the two heads of HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace have highlighted the government’s actions against the international non-governmental organisation (NGO) in India. “In the same spirit of constructive cooperation, may we also ask you to take note of the campaign of intimidation that the Indian ministry of home affairs (MHA) is currently engaged in against HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace India and other legitimate NGOs.” The letter from the two heads came on the same day as a press release from the NGO’s India office informing media that the bank account receiving domestic donations has been frozen again by the government. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace India said, “HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace has just learnt that one of its bank accounts has been frozen again, in violation of the stay granted by the Madras High Court; the court had ordered an eight-week stay on the MHA’s earlier decision to cancel HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace FCRA licence.” The release added, “Even as Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Narendra Modi prepares to address world leaders at the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, MHA launched its latest assault on HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace India.” The release also said, “The bank account that has been targeted this time is the one that receives donations from thousands of our Indian supporters. This action of the ministry is against our constitutional right to free speech and association.” The Indian arm’s interim head was quoted as saying, “India enjoys a fine reputation as the world’s largest, most vibrant democracy. But the actions of the MHA have already placed this reputation under threat, as voices of dissent are being methodically crushed.” In the joint letter by HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace US and the Indian arm, the organisations’ respective heads said the actions of the home ministry had tarnished India’s standing in the international community. 
 
'Modi must signal govt actually making changes in ecosystem' 
Press Trust of India, 25 September 2015, From Lalit K Jha and Yoshita Singh New York (PTI) -- Prime Minister HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Narendra Modi must signal that his government is not only committed to change, but is actually making the changes in the ecosystem needed for growth in trade, a top American advocacy group in the IT sector has said ahead of his visit to the Silicon Valley. "In order for Prime Minister Modi to be successful in his mission to Silicon Valley, he will need to convince both the startup entrepreneurs, as well as some of the biggest names in technology, that India's global ranking as an innovative place to do business is on the rise," HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Joshua Rosenberg of the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) said in a blog post yesterday. "Modi must signal that his government is not only committed to change, but is actually making the changes in the ecosystem at home which are needed to support this growth in trade, investment and innovation: the very same pillars he has recognised as critical to achieving his vision for India's development," he said. Modi is the first Indian premier to visit the Silicon Valley and meet its top CEOs and visit the campuses of top IT giants including HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Facebook and HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Google. As the Prime Minister visits the Silicon Valley with the objective of developing an eco-system of innovation and entrepreneurship in India, Joshua said lessons could be learned from India's previous technology revolution as much of India's success in software was because the industry grew faster than regulators could control it. Besides regulatory uncertainty, other serious problems include India's failure to resolve serious tax issues or develop an adequate dispute resolution system, he wrote. "In short, a large gap remains between Modi's vision and the follow through of the bureaucracy," he said. Citing that India is poised to ratify the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement by November, he wrote, yet New Delhi continues to oppose any updates to the outdated products list under the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" WTO's Information Technology Agreement which eliminates customs duties on ICT and electronics products. In fact, India has added a 10 per cent tariff to telecom products that falls under the existing ITA list. Besides, India's list of non-tariff barriers, including technical barriers to trade resulting from regulations impacting ICT, continues to grow. These issues will not move India and the US in the right direction as they attempt to meet the mutual goal of growing bilateral trade to USD 500 billion, a five-fold increase, he added.

China's President Courts American CEOs 
Shira Ovide, Jeremy Page, The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition), 25 September 2015, SEATTLE -- Chinese President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Xi Jinping's first state visit to the U.S. became a tug of war here Wednesday between optimism about commercial relations between the U.S. and China and fear that China isn't doing enough to open its doors to foreign companies or combat cybercrime. In front of some of the top executives of both countries -- including HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Apple Inc.'s HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Tim Cook, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Amazon.com Inc.'s HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Jeff Bezos and HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s Pony Ma -- Mr. Xi and other Chinese officials continued their push to highlight the scope of business opportunities in China. The country of 1.3 billion people is now the world's largest market in booming areas such as smartphones and online shopping. Mr. Xi also pledged to address U.S. concerns that China isn't moving fast enough to ease restrictions on foreign investment, while playing down tensions in other areas ahead of his summit with President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Barack Obama on Friday. "China will open up still wider to the outside world. Without reform there will be no driving force," Mr. Xi said. American business executives and Obama administration officials expressed doubts about Mr. Xi's commitment. "If those reforms do move forward then the opportunity for collective growth is high, but there is a big if," HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry trade group, said Wednesday at a U.S.-China Internet forum hosted by HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Microsoft Corp. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Microsoft also used the day to announce a series of small and midsize deals with Chinese companies, including one that makes HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Baidu Inc., China's dominant search engine, the default Web browser in China for HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Microsoft's Windows 10 software. Both Mr. Xi and the U.S. technology industry are trying to pull off a tricky balancing act, as each side seek to stay in the good graces of the other. U.S. tech companies are aiming for middle ground between courting China for access to its massive market and seeking to resist government restrictions, such as proposed requirements that tech companies hand over some of the software code in their products to Chinese authorities. For Mr. Xi, good relations with major U.S. tech companies and leaders burnish his country's reputation, but he also wants to hone China's homegrown technology industry and strengthen government control over the Internet -- two objectives that are often at loggerheads with the U.S. tech industry's business aims and policies. U.S. business leaders are reluctant to complain publicly about China's restrictions, for fear of being shut out of China or of Chinese retaliation. But in private gatherings, including after Mr. Xi's speech on Tuesday, they expressed doubts about Mr. Xi's rhetoric. Among the sore points are China's alleged hacking of U.S. companies and government agencies, and the theft of intellectual property. U.S. chief executives were "encouraged" that Mr. Xi is pledging to support the U.S. industry in China and combat hacking, said Tami Overby, senior vice president for Asia at the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents U.S. business interests. "Now we're waiting to see what the actions are." Ms. Overby and other business leaders hoped for more progress on cybersecurity issues, which have become a major source of tension between U.S. officials and business executives, and the Chinese government. Business groups also pushed for more progress on a bilateral trade treaty that Washington and Beijing are negotiating. In a policy speech here Tuesday evening attended by U.S. business leaders like Ford Motor Co. CEO HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Mark Fields and Microsoft co-Founder HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Bill Gates, Mr. Xi sounded a note of appreciation for the entrepreneurial culture celebrated in U.S. technology hubs like Silicon Valley. "The Chinese people have always held American entrepreneurship and creativity in high regard," he said. The Chamber of Commerce's Ms. Overby said she took to heart what Mr. Xi and other Chinese officials said this week about the need for executives and government officials in both countries to do more to understand each another's motivations. "There is a message in there that we also need to learn about China," she said. Mr. Xi and China's top Internet official, Lu Wei, pledged to cooperate with the U.S. on cybersecurity issues. They also reiterated that China is a victim of hacking but doesn't itself participate in digital attacks on U. S.companies or organizations. Experts on cybersecurity say that isn't true, though it can be tough to tie digital intrusions to the Chinese government directly. One expert said Mr. Xi's refusal to acknowledge the Chinese government's role in digital hacking may hold the U.S. and China back from setting rules of the road on cybercrime. "If they're not even going to say they do it, then how can we agree to a limit?" said Jason Healey, an expert on cybersecurity with Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. Despite tensions over cybersecurity and the recent pullback of China's economic growth, the market opportunity in China was underscored by a flurry of business deals announced this week by U.S. companies to coincide with Mr. Xi's trip to the U.S. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Boeing Co. hosted Mr. Xi on Wednesday at one of its manufacturing facilities outside of Seattle, and announced orders and commitments to sell 300 jets to China,â€•though some of those may have been orders HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Boeing had already booked. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Boeing and a commercial aircraft partner in China will establish for the first time a plant in the country to complete work on HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Boeing planes bound for China's burgeoning domestic-aviation sector.
Other tech-company deals largely focused on cementing ties with counterparts in China. Such tie-ups have proved increasingly necessary for the U.S. tech industry to keep a foot in China, as Mr. Xi seeks to bolster China's own technology industries in crucial sectors such as computing equipment and semiconductors For example, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Cisco Systems Inc. on Wednesday confirmed plans for a joint venture with Chinese computer maker HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Inspur Group Co., estimating that the companies will jointly invest about $100 million in the effort. "I'm optimistic that working with Inspur will add to the recent momentum that we've seen in our business in China," Cisco CEO HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Chuck Robbins wrote in a blog post.
 
India to Protect Intellectual Property Rights, PM Modi Tells Media Heads
HYPERLINK "http://www.ndtv.com/india-news" All India (NDTV) | Edited by HYPERLINK "http://www.ndtv.com/topic/anindita-sanyal" Anindita Sanyal | Updated: September 25, 2015 04:12 IST -- New York: India is committed to protecting Intellectual Property Rights - a subject on which US and India differ -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a group of media sector heads in New York today. "This is a technology driven era. We are a technology driven society... We are committed to protecting IPR which is essential to fostering creativity," PM Modi said. In May, the US had kept India and China on its Priority Watch List of trading partners that fail to protect intellectual property rights of its enterprises that invest in India, hurting the economy. US firms contend that India has lax rules on intellectual property rights -- especially in the pharmaceutical sector and the piracy of films and software. India maintains it complies with the global IPR rules under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement of the World Trade Organisation. But the administration led by President Obama had been hopeful of improvement in India's approach to IPR after the Narendra Modi government - seen as business friendly - had taken office. The issue had figured in the discussion at the India-US CEO Forum during President Obama's visit to India -- which both he and PM Modi had attended. The session with media heads -- a round table on technology and communications -- focused on leveraging India's growth story. During the session, coordinated by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Prime Minister met the top executives of News Corp, 21st Century Fox, Sony, Discovery, Time Warner and other media houses to discuss the latest trends in the field and opportunities with regard to India. "Expanding the bandwidth for Brand India... 40 per cent of the world's entertainment industry in one room!," tweeted External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup as the meeting started. During the 5-day visit, PM Modi will attend the United Nations General Assembly session in New York before he heads to the West Coast. He will also meet President Obama. 
 
Global goals summit: dignitaries convene for a day to define the world 
Liz Ford, The Guardian, 25 September 2015 -- Three years in the making, 17 goals, 169 targets, 193 countries: the moment has arrived for the world to stride towards a better future. Will vision become reality?
On Friday, three years after the idea was first mooted at a summit in Rio, 193 countries are expected to ratify a new set of ambitious global goals that aim to end extreme poverty and hunger, address the impact of climate change and reduce inequality by 2030. At the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN general assembly in New York, member states will formally adopt the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 accompanying targets resulting from the largest consultation process the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN has conducted in its 70-year history. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" goals, which promote human rights, gender equality and peaceful and just societies, will be officially adopted on day one of a HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" three-day summit that will begin with an address from HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Pope Francis. More than 150 world leaders are expected to be in attendance. The Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and the singers Shakira and Angelique Kidjo, both of whom are HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN and goodwill ambassadors, are slated for appearances at the summit. A HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" global campaign to raise the profile of the goals, headed by the film-maker Richard Curtis under the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" Project Everyone banner, will also kick off over the weekend. All countries will be required to implement the goals and ensure that everyone benefits. The indicators to measure progress against each goal are still under discussion and are due to be published in March. Annual national progress reviews will be conducted and heads of state are expected to meet every four years for a high-level stocktake. Those involved in the negotiations believe the inclusion of a goal calling for urgent action on climate change will make it harder for governments not to commit to strong action when they meet in HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" Paris in November for UN talks. Speaking last month, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the goals encompassed “a universal, transformative and integrated agenda that heralds an historic turning point for our world”. He said the summit would “chart a new era of sustainable development in which poverty will be eradicated, prosperity shared and the core drivers of climate change tackled”. The 17 goals were presented to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UNGA last year by an open working group of 70 countries that had been charged with producing a set of targets to replace the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" millennium development goals, which expire at the end of 2015. The idea for a new set of goals was regarded as the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" only significant outcome of the Rio+20 summit in 2012. The working group met for the first time in March 2013 and their final draft goals incorporated the views of HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN agencies, the private sector, civil society, consultations in 130 countries and the 7 million people who took part in the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN’s HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" My World survey. Speaking before the summit, Macharia Kamau, Kenya’s permanent representative to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN and one of two co-chairs of the open working group, said achieving consensus was an enormous challenge. “It took us 18 months to put together the SDGs and it wasn’t until the last quarter, maybe even the last fourth months, that we began to get a sense as to how all of this would pull together, because we really needed to get everybody to understand just how enterprising the challenge we had set ourselves after Rio was,” he said. “What is amazing to me is that even though it was an intergovernmental process and all the cynicism that comes with people’s perspectives of these processes, we have come out of the other end with a goal set that … was amazingly ambitious, beyond the expectations of even those who were participating in this process.” However, while the goals have garnered broad support, there are concerns they will not be truly transformational because they do not call for the structural change of global financial markets or trading systems. There are also questions about where the trillions of dollars to fund the goals will come from. A HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" financing conference held in Ethiopia in July failed to alleviate funding concerns as no new money was brought to the table, and the proposed intergovernmental tax body that would have given poorer countries greater decision-making powers on generating their own revenue was not endorsed. While overseas aid will continue to play a large part in funding, the private sector will be increasingly called on to provide resources. Kamau said the global goals represented a phenomenal opportunity for private sector investment, but a shift in mindset was required to bring about positive change.  “These resources are available, it’s not like the money isn’t out there,” he said. “The problem has been that the coming together of business, governments and civil society organisations has not been smooth and hasn’t been aligned to the goals we now have … the fear some might have that the business sector might not have the sensitivities that are an integral part of the global development agenda … need to be allayed to some extent as we continue to hold business to the same standard we hold all other development operations in the world.” The availability of accurate data to monitor progress will be a key factor in achieving the goals, particularly when it comes to seeing whether they have changed the lives of the poorest and most marginalised people. Announcements on new initiatives to collect data are expected over the coming week. David McNair, director of transparency at the advocacy group ONE, said the world is facing a data crisis that is “stifling the fight against poverty”. “By using information we have at our fingertips such as mobile phone records and satellite data we can better understand the problems we face and have a chance of holding governments to account for their commitments,” he said. “All eyes will be on world leaders this weekend as the new goals are gavelled in New York to make sure this vision becomes a reality.”
 
Development goals need Marshall Plan for Africa; When anti-poverty activists and the CIA find themselves in agreement, things must be very right or very wrong 
Bono, The Irish Times, 25 September 2015 -- If you are allergic to fanfare you'd better bolt your doors and shutter your windows today because there is going to be a lot of it in the vicinity of the United Nations, when world leaders ratify the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This is a genuinely big deal, of large consequence - let's hope - especially for the poorest people on the planet, but you will be forgiven if some of you are rolling your eyes, or yawning, or worse. At a time when Europe and the rest of the world are flailing in response to the massive refugee crisis in the Middle East, this hardly seems a time for grand commitments of any kind, unless it's a commitment to stop stumbling over our own two feet. It's a fair and pressing question: if we can't handle what's happening in Syria - if we can't even get the nomenclature right, insisting on calling these desperate refugees "migrants," as if they had just packed their suitcases and moved north for a change of scene - how can we possibly handle the more chronic, endemic humanitarian crises of extreme poverty and hunger and sickness? Who, exactly, do we think we are, launching another fanciful campaign? But pause for a second before you projectile vomit, and consider that the emergency in Syria shows exactly why we need to pursue - and achieve - these global goals. The evidence of that is all over the Sahel, the band across the north of Africa, where three extremes - extreme poverty, extreme climate and extreme ideology - pose a stark and constant threat. A failure to make progress there could trigger a series of crises that would dwarf what we're seeing in Syria.
End extreme poverty
HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Boko Haram, in northern Nigeria, is well known now in the rest of the world, by virtue of its being horrific and violent, but it's hardly the only group of extremists that's active in the Sahel: HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" al-Shabaab, the Lord's Resistance Army and al-Qaeda in the Maghreb are as well. CIA analysts - who are not, as a rule, dewy-eyed development types - have looked at northern Nigeria and said that the best way to stop the militants in the long run is to end extreme poverty in the area and create a better, more inclusive education system, one that Muslims feel they have some stake in. When the CIA and anti-poverty activists agree, things must be very right or very wrong! Especially when the demographers join in. By 2050, we're told, Africa will have 2½ billion people, twice the population of China, and more than a third of the youth on Earth will be African. Which is exciting news for all of us who find Africa, hands down, one of the world's most energizing places. But hundreds of millions of unemployed or underemployed young men, if it comes to that, is not a recipe for stability - either there or here, wherever "here" is for you. Of course the global goals are just that: goals, aspirations. Not blueprints or battle plans. As Amina Mohammed, the very impressive Nigerian assistant secretary general to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" UN who is shepherding the goals, would surely agree, they're the what, not the how. So what's the how?
Elements of opportunity
It's going to have to be a lot of things, of course. But one of them, a big one, might be an idea we're hearing from African leaders in business, civil society, and government: a modern Marshall Plan, inspired if not actually based on what the United States did in Europe after the second World War. According to Akin Adesina, the new president of the African Development Bank: "The future of feeding a projected nine billion people in the world by 2050 depends on Africa, which has 65 per cent of all arable land left. Africa cannot eat potential. To seize this potential requires a scaled global partnership, a modern-day Marshall Plan, but led by Africa." Similarly, "A comprehensive, co-ordinated approach" is what HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Tony Elumelu, the Nigerian entrepreneur and philanthropist, has called for, a plan for trade, transparency, employment, infrastructure - all the elements of opportunity. But what would a Marshall Plan even look like these days? Not exactly like secretary of state (and general) George C Marshall's Plan, which was brilliantly suited to its time, less so ours. The second World War left not only cities but entire economies in rubble; the Marshall Plan helped them rebuild. A modern Marshall Plan would, by contrast, have to focus on countries that were not industrialised to begin with but are working hard to build the foundations. To succeed, it would have to employ a bunch of means all at once - ganging up on the problems of extreme poverty and unequal opportunity. Aid is one of those means - an essential one. Our ultimate goal is the end of aid - growing economies, shared prosperity, self-sufficiency. But the way we're going to get there is to increase the aid, for now, to the countries that need it the most. The poorest countries get only a small share, 30 per cent, of the aid the world provides. Investing foreign funds can leverage domestic funds to improve basic health services and education for the poorest, especially women and girls. People have got smarter since the 1940s - smarter even since the early 2000s - in making sure that aid budgets get spent on what works and get results. A generation of techno-minded "factivists" is on the march, fighting corruption, campaigning for connectivity - and the access to information and opportunities it provides - and keenly aware that if it can mobilise its own domestic resources, soon it will no longer need the wealth of its partners to unlock prosperity in its own neighbourhood.
Private-sector capital
A 21st-century Marshall Plan would also have to get some private-sector skin in the game, not just foreign aid. The US in the 1940s gave loans to struggling businesses, which is still a good idea, but this doesn't just have to come from governments; there are successful companies across Africa and around the world that could invest in the ones that need capital. The private sector has got as much to gain as anyone from helping lagging industries to flourish, growing businesses to grow further and developing economies to become developed ones. And the private sector, in many ways, has more leverage than multilateral aid agencies in making that happen. It's got even more leverage when it works in concert with those aid agencies and with national and local governments. I saw this last month just outside Kigali, in Rwanda, where a combination of government assistance, through President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Barack Obama's Power Africa initiative, and private investment, through Gigawatt Global, has created a crazy futurist solar field that has boosted Rwanda's generation capacity by 6 per cent and has basically blown my circuits with its possibilities; this array just has to be seen. Europe's already on board with the idea of clean, green energy, promising to help 500 million people get access to it. The world ought to put its weight behind risk-takers such as Gigawatt and help them scale in places like northern Nigeria. The sun shines there, too.
Defence budgets
A modern George C Marshall Plan could even draw investment from defence budgets, because military planners are starting (just starting) to think like a health insurance plan that pays for your preventative medicine instead of just waiting for you to get deathly ill. The military loves its machines but it would rather not put its human beings into places where they are likely to get shot or worse. They know the original Marshall Plan was not just a postwar plan, it was an anti-war plan - designed to stop Soviet expansionism and keep the Cold War from getting hot in Europe. Peace and stability are of course a precondition for building anything lasting - or anything at all. There's a reason the Marshall Plan got started only after the war - not in the middle of it. Clearly we've got to end the fighting in Syria before development is even a remote possibility there. But that shouldn't - can't - stop us from preventing the dry regions of the world, full of tinder and lit with sparks, from exploding into flames. The Marshall Plan should be a model but it needn't be our only inspiration. There is plenty of that in Africa itself, from the solar fields in Rwanda to tech start-ups in Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania. There are success stories virtually everywhere on the continent - the brilliant work of a rising generation of African entrepreneurs and activists and artists and officials. It should egg us on to consider the role the millennium development goals played in increasing the number of children in schools and dramatically reducing child deaths, maternal mortality and the most degrading, debilitating sort of poverty. I've been fighting with the world most of my life, and I've learned that change mostly comes slowly and incrementally. But sometimes, when a situation demands it, we think big, act audaciously and we get it right - or at least partly right, which is no small thing. Now needs to be one of those times. We've got to get it right, right now, because the humanitarian disaster in the Middle East and the blundering towards a humane response in Europe and elsewhere are a kick to the collective gut, a brutal reminder of what it means to get it wrong. Syria will not be the last conflagration, but when we think and build as big as our goals we have a chance to prevent the fire next time.

Chinese president to target emissions 
Steven J. Mufson, The Washington Post, 25 September 2015 -- Chinese President HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Xi Jinping on Friday will announce a nationwide cap-and-trade program to curtail carbon emissions, adopting a mechanism most widely used in Europe to limit greenhouse gases, Obama administration officials said. Expanding on a pilot project in seven Chinese cities, the cap-and-trade program will impose a nationwide ceiling on emissions from the most carbon-intensive sectors of the Chinese economy and require companies exceeding their quotas to buy permits from those that have sharply reduced emissions. Xi will make the announcement in Washington in a joint statement with President Obama, who has been pressing world leaders to take ambitious steps to slow climate change and submit detailed plans in advance of a Paris climate conference in December. The announcement could provide a bright spot to a summit darkened with disagreements over China's cyberattacks on U.S. companies, its more restrictive proposed law on nongovernmental organizations, continuing human rights differences, and the apparent construction in progress of four fighter jet runways on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea. It also spells out the actions China will take to meet the target Xi set last November during Obama's visit to Beijing. China is the world's biggest emitting nation, accounting for nearly 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The government has already pledged that by 2020 it will reduce by 40 to 45 percent the amount of carbon produced for every unit of gross domestic product and will reach a peak emission level by 2030. How much the new cap-and-trade program alters that path will depend on the level of the nationwide cap. But it will apply to China's power generation sector, iron and steel industries, chemical firms, and makers of building materials, cement and paper. "Together they produce a substantial amount of China's climate pollution," said a senior administration official. "It is a significant move."
It also addresses an issue for ordinary Chinese, who have been angered by conventional air pollution that has obscured skylines and triggered widespread respiratory illnesses, as well as hundreds of thousands of premature deaths. China on Friday will also pledge to aid low-income nations in a financial commitment similar to the $3 billion the Obama administration has already asked Congress to appropriate in fiscal 2016 for the international Green Climate Fund. Obama will reaffirm his commitment to making that contribution and to already-announced plans for limiting emissions through regulations for heavy vehicles and the Clean Power Plan for utilities.
The joint statement on Friday will also include language reinforcing the end of an approach dating to 1992 that divided the world into developed countries that needed to take climate measures and less-developed ones that did not. The language will acknowledge different circumstances but require all countries to combat climate change. There are many ironies in the Chinese announcement. The cap-and-trade program was first advocated in the United States but first adopted in Europe. In Obama's first year in office in 2009, the House passed a cap-and-trade measure, but it died in the Senate. Some U.S. states have tried their own limited cap-and-trade programs, including California and a group of Northeast states. Li Shuo, HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Greenpeace's senior climate and energy policy adviser for East Asia, said that the climate accords last November, when China set ambitious targets, now bind the two countries together when the political horizon is hazy. "If there is a Republican president, you will have an interesting dynamic," Li said. "Can he or she walk away from an agreement without worrying about the consequences if there is a commitment made by the presidents of the two countries? An aspect of this is the politics: binding these two countries together."
 
Commodity nations must deal with the demise of a supercycle 
ByDaniel Yergin,  Financial Times (FT.Com), 24 September 2015 13:14 -- The recent collapse in oil prices is part of a larger drama — the last act in the commodity “supercycle” that began more than a decade ago. That is why the 50 per cent fall in oil prices means not only hard times for the petroleum industry but also portends distress for commodity-exporting nations and the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0)" world economy. The commodity boom took off in late 2003 and 2004 with the transformation of China’s role in the world economy. Following its accession to the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" World Trade Organisation in 2001, China was no longer just the traditional source of cheap goods, tough competition and a lid on inflation. It also became a huge market in itself. Its voracious appetite for commodities supported the build-out of an entire country. Between 2003 and 2013, China accounted for 45 per cent of the total growth in world oil demand. Commodity producers were caught unprepared and, as they scrambled to add capacity, prices rose from $20-$25 a barrel in the early 2000s to $100 or so in 2011-2013. The conviction grew that this would go on forever. Then Chinese demand tapered, and new capacity came on stream. China heat became China chill. The HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" IHS non-oil Material Price commodity index peaked in April 2011, and began declining. Over the past year, the decline has turned into a rout. Since July 2014 it is down 45 per cent. Oil was the holdout. High prices stimulated the development of new supplies, such as shale. US oil output, which was said in 2008 to have peaked, has instead almost doubled in the years since.
But, unlike other commodities, oil prices did not decline. The reason was that the new barrels were offset by the loss of barrels elsewhere: disruptions in key producing countries (most notably Libya) and the sanctions on Iran. In fact, oil prices reached their post-2008 peak of $115 not that long ago, in June 2014, when it appeared that the HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) might capture Baghdad and move on to the huge oilfields of southern Iraq.
But the Isis advance was stopped. Within months the slowing of the Chinese economy became evident, with the official shift from “high growth” to “medium-high growth”. Combined with rising US oil output, slower global growth and the temporary return of Libyan oil, this set the stage for HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" Opec’s decision not to cut production, initiating the collapse and a battle for market share. The downward pressure on oil has been accentuated by the fact that, since the collapse began, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the US have added about 2m barrels a day of supply to the market, when demand growth is less than 1.5m b/d. In fact, US oil production in April reached 9.7m b/d, higher than the annual high point registered in 1970.mThe resilience of US shale production has been a surprise to the global market. It is the result of ingenuity and lower service costs, combined with focus on high potential prospects by US producers. On the shale side, there has certainly been much room for greater efficiency. HYPERLINK "javascript:void(0);" IHS’ Performance Evaluator finds that just 30 per cent of the new wells in 2014 produced 80 per cent of the new oil. But efficiency cannot trump prices in the forties or high thirties. Current prices mean distress ahead for many producers and a decline in US output below 9m b/d by spring. At the same time, around the world, projects in early stages of development are being postponed, delayed or cancelled outright. Those countries that want to bring in new investment will have to be more competitive in their fiscal and other terms, which will require major changes in mindset and policies. All of this will mean a rebalancing of the global oil market over the next two years, with a lot of volatility along the way. The distress for nations that export oil and other commodities will increase. I once asked Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who served twice as Nigeria’s finance minister, what the phrase “petro-state” means. Her reply: “If you depend on oil and gas for 80 per cent of government revenues, over 90 per cent of exports are one commodity, oil, if that is what moves the growth of your economy . . . then you’re a petro-state.” That definition can be applied more broadly to “commodity-states” that benefited so much from a supercycle and now have to deal with its demise. The results, as they try to adjust their spending, will include austerity, bitterness and failed expectations, battles over budget and debt, social and political turmoil as well as hard economic times. The script for the final act of the commodity supercycle does not include a very happy ending.
