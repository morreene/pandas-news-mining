       "['WTO celebrates 20  of helping global economy grow GENEVA, Jan 1 (KUNA) The World Trade Organization (WTO) celebrated Thursday the 20th anniversary of its foundation to be the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. \"Over the past 20 , this organization has, on balance, made an  contribution to the global economy and to smoother trading relations between nations,\" WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo  in a press release. \"20  ago, on 1 January 1995, the WTO opened its doors for business. Since then this organization, and the system of transparent, multilaterallyagreed rules that it embodies, has made a major contribution to the strength and stability of the global economy,\" Azevedo  in a press release from the WTO headquarters in Geneva. He pointed that the WTO, over the past two decades, has helped to boost trade growth, resolve numerous trade disputes and support developing countries to integrate into the trading system. \"Indeed, when the global economy is more interconnected than ever, it is difficult to imagine a world without the WTO,\" he . Azevedo added that the WTO has also provided a bulwark against protectionism, the value of which was made plain in the trade policy response to the 2008 crisis, which was very calm and restrained in contrast to the protectionist panic that followed previous crises. \"Our organization has evolved since 1995. We have welcomed 33 new members, ranging from some of world largest economies to some of the least developed. Today our 160 members account for approximately 98 per cent of global trade,\" he explained. \"Moreover, at our 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we took our first major step forward in updating multilateral trade rules.\" The measures agreed in Bali were a real breakthrough for the WTO, and they will provide a significant economic boost. In December 2014 WTO Members came together to recommit to implementing all aspects of the Bali package. According to Azevedo, 2015 is set to be an eventful  for the WTO. \"We will be working to implement all aspects of the Bali package and we already have a full negotiating agenda including a deadline of July to conclude a detailed road map to tackle the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda,\" he . \"The WTO will also be seeking to make progress in negotiations on trade in environmental goods and on an agreement to remove tariffs on a wide range of information technology products.\" (end) ta.ibi',\n",

       " 'Compliance Rulings On Aircraft, Tuna, COOL To Headline DSB Action In 2015 World Trade Online Posted: December 30, 2014 A familiar cast of World Trade Organization disputes involving the United States will stay at the top of the agenda in 2015, as they remain mired in litigation over whether the offending party has complied with prior adverse WTO rulings. Among the compliance proceedings that will come to the forefront in 2015 are dueling cases by the United States and the European Union over the subsidies each side provided to their respective aircraft manufacturers; Mexico case against the U.S. \"dolphinsafe\" label for tuna that it charges keeps it effectively out of the U.S. market; and the challenge by Canada and Mexico of the U.S. countryoforigin labeling regime for meat. A decision in the tuna case could be first one to be announced, as the compliance panel is slated to issue its report by the end of the 2014. The compliance panel in that case (DS381) has been considering since April whether a 2013 rule issued by the U.S. implements an earlier WTO ruling. In doing so, it is examining whether the new rule makes a \"legitimate regulatory distinction\" in setting different requirements for tuna caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean and other fisheries to obtain the dolphinsafe label. In the aircraft disputes, the two WTO compliance panels evaluating an EU challenge of tax breaks for Boeing and a U.S. challenge of EU member state support for Airbus are set to release their reports in the middle and end of 2015, respectively. The Airbus case (DS316) was delayed in October \"due to the substantive and procedural complexities\" of the dispute, according to a communication from the panel. In May, the compliance panel for the Boeing dispute (DS353) delayed its report due to \"the scale and complexity of the dispute.\" In a related development, the EU on Dec. 19 requested another set of WTO consultations over a new round of tax breaks provided by Washington state to Boeing, charging they amount to illegal subsidies contingent on the use of domestic products over imported ones. Another crucial dispute involves Canada and Mexico challenge (DS386 & DS384) of U.S. countryoforigin labeling (COOL) for meat. In October, a compliance panel found that a 2013 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule attempting to remedy the original 2008 farm bill provision mandating the label had, in fact, worsened the program impact on Mexican and Canadian livestock producers. In an appeal filed in November, the United States is seeking to reverse the compliance panel finding that the COOL rule violates Article 2.1 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), which requires that members\\' technical regulations not discriminate against imported products. But the compliance panel sided with the U.S. in finding no violation of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, which requires technical measures to be no more restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. Canada and Mexico have filed separate appeals of that finding. In a related development, the omnibus spending bill funding the government in FY 2015 that President Obama signed into law on Dec. 16 contains a provision that puts the onus on the administration to propose changes to the COOL to bring it into compliance with the WTO rulings. It asks USDA to report its recommendations to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees by May 1, 2015 or 15 days after the final resolution of the case, whichever is earlier. This requirement, like others in the bill, is technically not binding, but congressional aides have warned that agencies ignore the demands of appropriators \"at their own peril.\" In another dispute under compliance litigation, a panel evaluating whether China complied with an adverse WTO ruling on its trade remedy duties applied to imports of grainoriented electrical steel (GOES) is slated to release its report by the second quarter of 2015 (DS414). In that dispute, the U.S. is alleging that China did not conduct an injury analysis in accordance with WTO rules when Beijing applied trade remedy duties on GOES imports. One dispute that has not yet advanced to the compliance stage is a successful U.S. challenge of China restrictions on electronic payment services providers. The U.S. has continued to charge that China has failed to comply with a 2012 panel ruling in this case, but has not sought a panel ruling under DSU Article 21.5. Apart from compliance proceedings, the DSB has a heavy load of other disputes involving the U.S., some of which have been delayed because of the high volume of cases and the staff shortages at the legal section. One of these delayed rulings is for a Korean challenge of U.S. countervailing duties on imports of large residential washers. The panel evaluating that dispute, composed in June 2014, on Dec. 15 delayed the release its report until the end of 2015. Jan. 15 marks the deadline for the Appellate Body to release its report in Argentina appeal of a panel ruling that faulted several import restrictions imposed by Buenos Aires as violations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (DS444). A separate dispute brought by Argentina in 2012 against a U.S. ban on imports of Argentine beef should see a panel report by early 2015 (DS447). Another dispute brought by Argentina against U.S. measures restricting lemon imports (DS448) from a region of that country, which was filed at nearly the same time in mid2012 as the meat dispute, still has not made it further than the consultations phase. Additionally, parties have until Jan. 16 to appeal a panel ruling that faulted the U.S. Department of Commerce practice of initially presuming that all exporters from nonmarket economies (NMEs) like Vietnam and China are units of the same governmentrun entity in AD proceedings (DS429). Meanwhile, Feb. 28 marks the deadline for a WTO panel to deliver its report in China challenge (DS471) of U.S. AD methodology. The DSB composed a panel for the U.S. challenge of India domestic content requirements for both phases of its Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission on Sept. 24, meaning the deadline for the panel to complete its work will be March 24 (DS456). In a separate dispute, India and the U.S. have also asked the DSB to adopt a panel report faulting India measures against imports of U.S. poultry by Jan. 26 (DS430). Other pending disputes include two separate U.S. challenges of Indonesia restrictions on the importation of horticultural products, animals and animal products. A panel for the first dispute (DS455) was composed in April 2013, while the parties remain in consultations for a second dispute brought by the U.S. (DS478) in May 2014. The reasonable period of time for China to implement DSB recommendations after a panel and the Appellate Body faulted its restrictions on exports of rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum expires on May 2, as agreed by Beijing and Washington (DS431). The European Union and Canada, meanwhile, have agreed on a reasonable period of time expiring on Oct. 18 for the EU to bring its regime into compliance with a mixed Appellate Body ruling that  an EU ban on the importation of seal products constituted an arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (DS400). Apart from the EU new assault on Boeing tax breaks from Washington state, several other disputes involving the U.S. still remain in the consultation phase. One is a U.S. challenge of Chinese support for its automobile and auto parts industry (DS450) for which consultations were requested during the heat of the 2012 presidential campaign. Another is the Korea Dec. 22 request for consultations with the U.S. over a highly scrutinized U.S. Department of Commerce decision that led to the imposition of antidumping AD duties on imports of oil country tubular goods (OCTGs) from Korea. Seoul request centers on Commerce methodology for determining which profit information to use to calculate the fair value of the product in question, although it also takes issue with other aspects of Commerce July 2014 final determination, sources .',\n",

The World Trade Organization WTO logo is seen at the entrance of the WTO headquarters in Geneva April 9, 2013 (REUTERS/RUBEN SPRICH) Sharif  his country plans to make a formal request to join WTO this month adding that they are making the final touches in preparation for a meeting with WTO Commissioner General. According to sources that spoke to Sudan Tribune from Geneva last June, Sudan has been seeking WTO membership since November 1994 but negotiations have stalled since 2004. The sources noted that the government has allocated a big budget for WTO negotiations while training opportunities provided by WTO to Sudan are given to specific people. To join, candidate countries have to offer to cut tariffs and change their laws to guarantee the rights of importers and exporters under WTO rules. The minister of trade told the German news agency (DPA) according to progovernment Ashorooq TV that Sudan established a department in his ministry to manage WTO membership process. He  that laws relating to trade in Sudan have been translated all official languages at WTO and all statistics are now updated. All projects and Sudans vision for the business structure in the country and the trade system were also included, he added. Sharif pointed out that Sudan is a WTO monitored state since 20  ago but has yet to obtain membership. He attributed this situation to political reasons. \"There is no reason regarding the laws or the efficiency of Sudan and its ability to obtain membership,\" Sharif added. \"We conducted bilateral and collective negotiations, and we were supposed to hold a third round in June 2004 that would have Sudan join the WTO, but this was postponed indefinitely, and this postponement continued until today,\" he added. The official noted that the secession of South Sudan disrupted the procedures and forced them to revise to the data and figures to reflect the new situation. On the trade situation in Sudan, he  that \"oil made us lose sight of agricultural products, and nonpetroleum products have become an  figure, and was able to compensate for [lost] oil income, as well as the entry of gold and other minerals such as iron and manganese, which was discovered in Sudan and in large quantities that contributed to national income. The expert at WTO in Geneva Fadl Mohiydeen Tahir told Sudan Tribune previously that authorities in Sudan suffer several problems and lack transparency in addition to a misconception they have that major powers are impeding Sudans accession to the WTO. He noted that the West, including the United States affirmed their support for the accession of least developed countries to the organisation, pointing out that Sudan prevented itself from taking advantage of opportunities and support from international organizations. . Fadl  that Sudans failure to join the WTO contributed to the lack of economic and transparent investment laws which reflected on the instability of the economy and the spread of corruption and cronyism. He pointed out that Sudan joining WTO would contribute to attracting foreign and domestic investment and achieving transparency and stability in line with WTO rules and prevents the flight of the national capital and attracting national and foreign investors, which requires a large package of measures and laws.',\n",

Beijing will instead monitor rareearth exports using a system of permits issued based on trade contracts, without the need for additional documents of state approval, according to a Ministry of Commerce statement. The most  factor for the abolition of the rareearth quota is that the government has been moving toward greater market orientation, with the state increasingly stepping back from the picture,  Jin Bosong, deputy director of the commerce ministrys International Trade and Economic Cooperation Research Institute.

The worlds secondlargest economy, which also produces about 90% of the worlds rareearth minerals, exported 24,866 metric tons of the metals in the first 11 months last , well below the 30,611 tons it set as the quota for 2014.',\n",

The privilege under the WTO special TRIPS (Traderelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) that covers pharmaceutical products expires this . The general transitional period for trade has already been extended till 2021 and it covers interests of most of the leastdevelopedcountry members of the World Trade Organisation. But, experts say, it is difficult for Bangladesh to get the transitional period for pharmaceuticals extended under the special TRIPS since this is not a field of common interest of the club of world poorer nations. Munir Uddin Ahmed, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Dhaka,  it may be challenging for Bangladesh to motivate the leastdeveloped country (LDC) members for collectively lobbying the WTO as Bangladesh is the only LDC seeking to get the special TRIPS for pharmaceuticals extended up to 2021. An official at the WTO cell under the ministry of commerce : \"We understand that TRIPS extension will be more helpful for Bangladesh than other LDC members and it is not easy to unite all the members.\" He  as the general TRIPS covers different businesses of most of the LDC members and it has already been extended.

The difference in their level of ambition for trade liberalization casts doubt on the likelihood of a compromise being reached by the end of this  as planned, according to the sources. Six rounds of RCEP negotiations have been held since the ASEAN members plus its six regional partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea launched the talks in May 2013 based on a November 2012 agreement. The ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. At the latest RCEP talks held in India in early December, the ASEAN bloc proposed eliminating tariffs on 80 percent of traded goods within a 10 period. But India and China held firm on their desire to remove duties on only 40 percent, with South Korea voicing its support, the sources .

India also keeps rejecting an ambitious trade liberalization target, with a negotiating source suggesting the country has an \"overwhelming excess of imports over exports.\" The emerging South Asian economy imports large amounts of communication devices and other goods from China.

       " 'A new push is needed on multilateral cooperation 2 January 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Over the past  a cooperative world order built around trade and the rule of law has begun to creak and strain. Following its annexation of Crimea, Russia, the eighthlargest economy, was hit by international sanctions. War is raging in the Middle East. Disease, in the form of the Ebola virus, is ravaging parts of Africa. The EU is still struggling to resolve the euro crisis. Efforts at international cooperation to combat these common threats have too often been weak and disappointing. The  2015 should be one in which multilateralism and international cooperation make a comeback. Fortunately, the  political calendar will present a number of opportunities to do just that across  areas from trade to climate to development and arms control. The next 12 months are likely to be makeorbreak for efforts to achieve an ambitious Transpacific trade deal the TPP (or TransPacific Partnership). Progress towards a Transatlantic deal, known as TTIP, is less well advanced. But the coming  will give a good sense of whether politicians in Europe and North America are serious about doing a deal. For European politicians in particular who are searching for ways to restore economic optimism, progress on a trade deal would be immensely helpful. Efforts to strike an international agreement on climate change will reach a climax at a summit in Paris in December. The failure of the Copenhagen summit of 2009 led to a lasting loss of confidence in the world ability to reach an agreement on the climate. This time the largest economies, notably China and the US, look more serious. A climate deal in Paris would do much to arrest the dangerous fatalism that too often intrudes upon discussions of climate change. Efforts to stop nuclear proliferation look almost as fraught as the climate negotiations. Once again, 2015 will be an  . In May, the 189 state signatories of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty will meet in New York to review the state of the treaty an exercise that is held every five . Against a backdrop of rising tensions between Russia and the US, and turmoil in the Middle East, it seems unlikely that the NPT review conference will make significant progress towards disarmament. Merely holding the line against further proliferation could be counted an achievement. The real chance for progress in nuclear disarmament, however, remains the longrunning negotiations between Iran and a group of world powers, informally led by the US. A deal to curtail the Iranian nuclear programme in return for a lifting of economic sanctions would be a significant achievement for President Barack Obama, allowing him to follow up a rapprochement with Cuba with a reconciliation with Iran. Finally, 2015 will be a significant milestone in international development. In September, yet another major UN conference in New York will seek to replace the Millennium Development goals, adopted in 2000, with a new set of Sustainable Development goals. More progress was made towards the MDGs, for example in reducing child mortality, than many sceptics believed possible in 2000. It is  that, in setting new development goals, the UN resists the temptation to go for rhetorically satisfying targets that will be hard to define and achieve, for example on income inequality. These should be eschewed in favour of more practical and achievable ones, on issues such as clean water and childhood vaccination. Leaders have the chance over the next  to relaunch multilateral cooperation on a range of vital issues. They should seize the opportunity.',\n",
       " 'A Trade Opportunity for Obama and the New Congress By Charles Boustany and Robert B. Zoellick 30 December 2014 The Wall Street Journal Europe After the midterm U.S. elections, political commentators identified trade policy as one area for cooperation between President Obama and the Republican Congress. We agree. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress has authority over trade. But the active direction and use of that authority depends on an energetic executive, in partnership with Congress. According to a recent Pew Research survey, 66% of Americans believe greater U.S. involvement in the global economy is a \"good thing,\" with only 25% thinking it is bad. The TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement is a \"good thing\" in the eyes of 55% of Americans, versus 25% who consider it bad; the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) scores 53% good and 20% bad. These inclinations offer opportunity. Prof. Richard Neustadt explained to President John F. Kennedy that the presidency relied on the \"power to persuade.\" It time for Mr. Obama to persuade on trade. He must make use of the convening power of the executive to bolster his advocacy. His administration must work closely with Congress to listen, explain, address problems and cut deals. So why does trade matter? First, Americans are feeling squeezed. On the eve of the election, Pew Research reported that 79% of Americans considered the economy to be poor or at best fair. A boost in U.S. trade can increase wages and lower living expenses for families offering higher earnings and cutting taxes on trade. Manufacturing workers who produce exports earn, on average, about 18% more, according to the Commerce Department. Their pay raise can be traced to the higher productivity of competitive exporting businesses. Since World War II, U.S. trade policy has focused on lowering barriers to manufacturing and agricultural products. But U.S. trade negotiators also use freetrade agreements (FTAs) to pry open service sectors and expand ecommerce. In recent , such business services as software, finance, architecture and engineering employed 25% of American workers, more than twice as many as worked in manufacturing. Business service employees earned over 20% more than the average manufacturing job, and the U.S. consistently runs a trade surplus in business services. Over the past five , the World Bank reports, about 75% of the world growth has been in emerging markets, which generally have higher barriers to trade. As America highly productive farmers and ranchers have seen, growing world markets are the drivers of higher sales. With the boom in U.S. energy innovation and production, fuel exports could spur more investment and jobs in that sector, too. American families, and businesses, benefit from higher incomes and lowerpriced imports. The World Trade Organization reports that the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round, the last big global trade agreement, have increased the purchasing power of an average American family of four by $1,300 to $2,000 every . The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the new trade deals in the works could offer that family another $3,000 or more a . Second, the U.S. and world economies desperately need a shift from extraordinary governmental spending and zerointerestrate monetary policies to growth led by the private sector. Sustained growth can only be generated by private investment, innovation and purchases. American companies need greater confidence in freeenterprise policies before investing their big cash reserves. Trade policy offers an international partnership to overcome structural impediments to growth. The negotiations for the TPP, for example, aim to create an open trade and investment network among the U.S., six current FTA partners, and five new ones. The biggest additional market is Japan, a pivotal Pacific ally. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to use the TPP to press his own economy toward more competition, without which his goal of reviving Japan will falter. Vietnam and Malaysia would also take part; they believe they can use the rules and disciplines of the TPP to boost growth, improve industries and services, expand global linkages, and avoid the socalled \"middle income\" trap, where countries\\' lack of productivity growth slows the rise to higher incomes. The TTIP under negotiation with the 28 countries of the European Union could overcome regulatory barriers that now choke off Europe economic recovery and weigh down U.S. growth. The industries that already operate across the Atlantic such as autos, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing could offer examples of ways to promote more competition with high standards. The U.S. is wellpositioned to benefit from new, expanded and enforceable rules for fair competition. With an advanced economy at the technological frontier, American companies have demonstrated a rare capacity to innovate as we have seen in software, use of Big Data, energy, robotics and bioengineering. The demands of consumers and business for better services in retail, communications, entertainment, education, health care, infrastructure, transport and logistics in both developed and developing economies, offer privatesector opportunities for growth. Third, U.S. foreign policy has been drifting. President Obama disengagements, have eroded confidence in America staying power. Trade policy can help reestablish America international economic commitment; U.S. economic interests underpin political and security ties. New economic links with key security partners on the Pacific and Atlantic rims of the Eurasian continents advance our primary geopolitical interests. And trade policy enlists America greatest asset its dynamic private sector in support of U.S. foreign policy. Just as American commerce in the 19th and 20th centuries sailed with missionaries, engineers and educators, so 21stcentury trade, investment and business networks will promote the causes of civil society, human rights, the environment and gender equality.  Mr. Boustany (R., La.) is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, where he serves on the Subcommittee on Trade. Mr. Zoellick served as U.S. trade representative, deputy secretary of state, and president of the World Bank. END ________________________________',\n",

Asia fourthlargest economy wants to protect farmers after scrapping a cap on politically sensitive imports of the main staple in line with international trade commitments made via the WTO. In September, it set the tax at 513 percent, saying that was the highest rate possible under parameters set by the WTO. A joint statement by the country finance, trade and agriculture ministries on Tuesday added that Seoul would hold bilateral talks with its main foreign rice suppliers to ease concerns over how the rate was calculated. Those countries are the United States, China, Thailand, Vietnam and Australia. South Korea is broadly selfsufficient in the grain, but under the WTO agreement, it purchased 408,700 tonnes of foreign rice in 2014, 9 percent of its demand. Under the new scheme, Seoul is still required to import at least 408,700 tonnes a . The import of 408,700 tonnes attracts a tariff of 5 percent, and the 513 percent applies to shipments above that level. (Reporting by Brian Kim; Editing by Meeyoung Cho)',\n",
       " 'S. Korea set to begin talks on liberalization of rice market GENEVA/SEJONG, Jan. 6 (Yonhap) Five countries, including the United States, have so far raised objections to South Korea proposed tariff rate on its rice imports, officials  Tuesday, as negotiations begin on the terms for South Korea rice market opening. After 20  of waivers, South Korea liberalized its rice market through tariffication at the start of the  with a 513 percent tariff to be imposed on all nonmandatory rice imports. The country has to import 408,700 tons of rice every  under minimum market access (MMA). Such mandatory imports are subject to only a 5 percent tariff. The tariff rate for nonmandatory imports must be agreed upon by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). South Korean officials say the process may take , noting such a process for Taiwan took 57 months. According to South Korea Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, five countries the U.S., China, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam have filed a complaint with the WTO, arguing that the offered tariff rate for nonmandatory imports is too high. South Korean officials  these countries hold a special interest in Seoul rice market. \"Of the countries that have raised an objection, four, except Vietnam, had jointly shared a countryspecific quota of 200,000 tons per  in rice exports to South Korea under the MMA quota,\" Choi Seokyoung, chief of the South Korean mission to Geneva, told reporters. These four countries oppose South Korea rice market opening as it has ceased the countryspecific quota, meaning South Korea no longer is required to import rice from them. Choi and the South Korean trade ministry assured that Seoul has no intention of making a concession, saying its tariff rate is more than reasonable when compared to those of Japan and Taiwan that liberalized their local rice markets before South Korea. South Korea 513 percent tariff is an ad valorem duty, which is tax based on the price of an article. Taiwan and Japan, on the other hand, impose a specific tax, which fixes the amount of tax depending on the weight of rice imports. \"Japan and Taiwan liberalized their rice markets with a specific tax, which at the time of their market opening translated into an ad valorem tax of over 1,000 percent,\" Choi told reporters. The South Korean trade ministry  Seoul needs to reach an agreement with each and every one of the countries that have objected to the tariff rate before obtaining an official WTO approval. \"The government will do its utmost to make sure the country rice import tariff rate is fixed as it is, through negotiations with the countries that have filed a complaint,\" the ministry .',\n",

       " \"Trade friction to ease as China axes rare earth quotas By Lucy Hornby in Beijing 6 January 2015 New licensing regime to be introduced in wake of US victory at WTO China has scrapped quotas on rare earths exports and will probably replace them with a resources tax, eliminating a policy that caused friction with its trading partners and heightened awareness of their importance as strategic assets. China is home to most of the world deposits and almost all processing of the 17 minerals classed as rare earths elements with uses ranging from instrument panels to speciality steels. A policy of export restrictions introduced a decade ago received worldwide attention in 2010, when a tightening of the quotas left traders scrambling and raised strategic concerns in Washington and Tokyo. The US won a challenge against the quotas at the World Trade Organisation last . Regulations for export quotas in 2015 issued by the ministry of commerce  that quotas for rare earths, as well as other products including tungsten and coke, would be replaced by an export licensing regime. Metals analysts  that would probably include a resources tax. The price impact in the market would be limited,  Peng Weiwei, analyst at Beijing consultancy Asian Metal, and it was unclear which companies would receive permission to export. More broadly, China has moved to implement resources taxes, which would allow the state to gain a simpler revenue stream from mining and energy production. These are in place of quota systems that usually benefit wellconnected companies or individuals by creating a lucrative price gap between domestic and international markets. In some respects, China quota policy has been a success. Implemented at a time when its rare earths were exported cheaply and processed primarily in Japan, the price differential created by the quotas inspired many Japanese companies to move their plants to the region around Baotou in Inner Mongolia, one of the centres of rare earths mining in China. But other goals of the quotas have not been successful: there has been little letup in the environmental damage caused by rare earths mining and processing, and the pace at which they are mined has slackened little. The runup in prices as quotas tightened also spurred funding for rare earths mining outside China , which had previously been unprofitable. The volatility in prices, particularly a 2011 spike after China tightened quotas, has also led manufacturers to find other materials for applications including magnets. That has alleviated some of the strategic concerns of China trading partners, which centred on the minerals' importance to defence and hightech industries. Repeated attempts to consolidate the industry have sparked territorial battles between local and national stateowned mining companies, particularly in the region around Ganzhou, in Jiangxi province. On Friday, the stateowned company that dominates rare earth production around Baotou  it had acquired nine rare earths mining companies from the Inner Mongolian government.\",\n",
       " 'U.S. Gives Ireland Green Light To Ship Beef, But Final Hurdle Still Remains World Trade Online Posted: January 5, 2015 Ireland on Monday (Jan. 5) became the first European Union member state to secure approval to export beef to the United States since the Obama administration in 2013 eased a more than decadeold ban on meat from EU cattle that was implemented in the wake of a \"mad cow\" disease outbreak. However, exports cannot actually begin until the Irish government certifies individual meat plants as being eligible to ship to the U.S. market. In a Jan. 5 statement, Ireland Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine  the U.S. decision \"clears the way for the Irish authorities to approve individual beef plants here to export to the U.S., approval for which will be based on agreed criteria with their U.S. counterparts.\" A spokeswoman for the department clarified in an email to Inside U.S. Trade that the U.S. had determined Ireland food safety system for beef to be \"equivalent\" to that of the United States. This in turn gives Ireland authorities the ability to certify that Irish meat plants are eligible to ship to the U.S. But the spokeswoman  no such plants had been authorized yet to date. \"The Department has been working with interested plants here in some detail over the last few months to assess their suitability for export to the U.S. market. Now that approval has been agreed, we will intensify this process and work closely with the suitable plants immediately to facilitate trade commencing as soon as possible,\" she added. The spokeswoman declined to provide details on what kind of criteria Irish plants would have to meet, and whether they would impose many new special requirements for exporters or largely reflect existing Irish standards. Officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the Irish announcement. As of midday on Jan. 5, the website of USDA Food Safety & Inspection Service had not posted an equivalency determination with regard to Ireland. The European Commission, in a separate Jan. 5 statement, also welcomed the U.S. move to allow Irish beef imports, saying it \"sends an  and positive signal to the other EU Member States who have requested the U.S. to reestablish access to the US beef market.\" The United Kingdom and the Netherlands, a large producer of veal, have also sought to gain authorization for their meat producers to ship to the U.S. At the biannual Trade Policy Review of the United States at the World Trade Organization in December, the EU complained about the delay in approving beef imports from EU member states. In its Jan. 5 statement, the commission added that it is now \"desirable that the U.S. acts expeditiously to extend the approval to the rest of the European Union and to fully bring their import conditions in line with international standards.\" Brussels has repeatedly pressed Washington to treat the EU as a single entity for the purposes of determining equivalency with the U.S. food safety standards. It has made this a chief aim in the talks on sanitary and phytosanitary measures in the broader U.S.EU free trade negotiations. Currently, USDA and other U.S. agencies like the Food & Drug Administration evaluate EU member states\\' various safety systems individually. The announced move to authorize Ireland to ship beef comes after a change in late 2013 to U.S. rules on mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The new rules generally allow the import of beef from countries determined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as posing a \"negligible\" risk for BSE. But they also allow countries with a \"controlled risk\" or \"undetermined risk\" status for BSE to ship to the U.S., provided they can show a certification that materials posing an increased risk of transmitting the disease have been removed. EU member states do not all have the same BSE risk status. For example, the Netherlands has a negligible BSE status, like the United States. The United Kingdom and Ireland, meanwhile, have a controlled risk status. The U.S. market has been closed to EU beef, including deboned beef, since January 1998, when the U.S. introduced import restrictions on beef, sheep and goats and their products on the basis of BSE risks, the European Commission  in its statement. \"These measures went beyond the standards of the [OIE] according to which, for example, deboned skeletal muscle beef is safe and can be freely traded from all countries, regardless of their BSE status,\" the statement added.',\n",
       " 'Mexico To Battle Undervalued Textile Imports With Minimum Reference Price Inside U.S. Trade 12/26/2014 One of the new trade policy measures announced by Mexico to crack down on lowpriced shipments of textiles and apparel from China and Hong Kong would set up a minimum reference price for the purposes of assessing duties and taxes on those products. Although the details of the scheme are not entirely clear, two trade lawyers this week questioned whether it might violate the Customs Valuation Agreement (CVA) in the World Trade Organization. The CVA establishes rules for determining the value of imported goods for the purposes of calculating customs duties. But Moises Kalach, president of Mexico National Textile Industry Chamber and head of Grupo Kaltex, maintained in an interview that all of the new measures comply with WTO rules. Under the Mexican scheme, shipments that enter below the minimum reference price would be subject to an investigation by the Mexican government that could lead to the imposition of additional duties and taxes. Specifically, importers whose shipments entered at below the minimum reference price would have to pay the duties and valueadded tax based on their declared price, but would also have to post a bond for the additional duties and taxes that would be due if the shipment had entered at the reference price, according to a Mexican industry source. For example, if a shipment facing a 10 percent tariff comes in at $100 but the reference price is $200, the importer would have to pay $10 and post a bond for an additional $10. The importer would then be subject to an investigation by Mexican tax agency SAT. If the importer can demonstrate to the SAT that the declared price is accurate and represents the transaction value, no further duties and taxes would be charged and the bond would not be collected, this source . But if the SAT determines that the declared price is undervalued, it could charge the importer additional duties and taxes that would be collected by redeeming the bond within three months, according to this source. The trade lawyers  this scheme could run contrary to the CVA because the agreement establishes that, in general, the customs value of a shipment should be based on the \"transaction value,\" meaning the amount actually paid or payable for the good upon exportation. That , the CVA lays out a series of other methods for calculating the customs value if the transaction value cannot be determined, such as using identical goods, similar goods, or a constructed value. It also includes a \"fallback\" option in the event none of the specified methods can be applied. That fallback option, described in CVA Article 7, states that if the customs value cannot be determined through the specified methods in the agreement, then it shall be \"determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions\" of the CVA and the customs valuation article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and \"on the basis of data available in the country of importation.\" But Article 7.2 also lays out several methods that are specifically not to be used under this fallback option, including the selling price in the importing country, minimum customs values and \"arbitrary and fictitious\" values. Amelia Porges, a Washingtonbased trade lawyer and former U.S. trade official, noted that a WTO panel ruled in 2009 that Colombia violated CVA Article 7.2 by using an indicative price to calculate the customs value when the transaction value fell below the indicative price. The WTO challenge was brought by its neighbor Panama.',\n",

       " 'After 8  of membership, what has the WTO brought to Vietnam? 5 January 2015 Vietnam News Summary The expected gains from Vietnams membership in the WTO (World Trade Organization) remain unclear, while the losses are more noticeable. Under WTO commitments, Vietnam opened its distribution market fully to foreign investors in January 1, 2009. But in fact, some foreign investors made their presence in Vietnam before that time. Big C, for example, joined the Vietnamese market in 1998 when setting up a joint venture with a Vietnamese partner, while Metro Cash & Carry got a license to set up a 100 percent foreign owned enterprise in 2002. The limitations on the kinds of good foreigners can distribute in Vietnam have been applied since January 1, 2007. This means that the foreign distributors who came to Vietnam before that time did not have any limitations. Vietnam did not set any limitations regarding the sources of the products to be distributed in Vietnam. This means that foreign invested distribution chains can determine what products to be displayed in their chains, even if they are made in Vietnam or sourced from other countries. The Vietnamese logistics market has also become a playing field for foreign firms. A report from the Vietnam Shipowners Association showed there are only 25 operational foreign invested logistics firms in Vietnam, but they control 80 percent of the logistics market. Vietnam has joined the WTO, but the economy remains weak,  Dr. Le Dang Doanh, a renowned independent economist. This is attributed to the weak inner strength of the national economy. Vietnam has been too slow in carrying out economic reforms, he noted. What will happen? According to Truong Dinh Tuyen, former Minister of Trade, under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Vietnam bears pressure on goods trade because it had to cut import tariffs. Meanwhile, under the WTO, the major pressure is on the opening of the service market. Vietnam has committed to open a productionrelating service market from January 11, 2015, which analysts say will start a foreign outsourcing vs domestic outsourcing battle. Pham Chi Lan, a renowned economist, commented: Vietnam, before joining WTO, had advantages in doing footwear and garment outsourcing. After joining WTO, its advantages are still in footwear, garment outsourcing and making some electronic parts. However, outsourcing will be no longer be the privilege of Vietnamese industrial enterprises, once foreigninvested enterprises can also join the playing field. The enterprises will have advantages in obtaining outsourcing contracts as nominated by multinational conglomerates. Also from January 11, 2015, foreign investors will have full rights just like Vietnamese in hotel development and food & beverage catering. Analysts warn that if Vietnamese cannot well prepare for this eventuality, they will only get small pieces of the lucrative business field. (Viet Nam Net January 5)',\n",
       " 'Agriculture lobby prepares to push Cuba trade in 2015 By Bill Tomson | 1/2/15 8:32 AM EST POLITICO Congress hasnt heard the last about opening up trade to Cuba from the U.S. agriculture industry, even after the Obama administrations latest actions. Spurred on by the administrations overhaul to Cuba relations last month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Farmers Union, the American Soybean Association and many other groups say they are now prepared to lobby the 114th Congress to make even more substantial changes, like allowing U.S. banks to finance exports. Its going to take an act of Congress to get to a point to where we can compete [in Cuba],  Devry Boughner Vorwerk, Cargills vice president of corporate affairs and chair of the U.S. Agriculture Coalition for Cuba, a collection of farm and food groups. The umbrella group is rallying its forces and planning a big push this  to get Congress to lift the 55old embargo, beginning with a Jan. 8 press conference that it calls a new launch of its mission to improve trade ties with Cuba. President Barack Obama got the ball rolling on Dec. 17 when he announced his intentions to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, set up an embassy in Havana, allow Americans to send more money to family in Cuba and undo a George W. Bush administrationimposed regulation that restricted U.S. agricultural exports. It wasnt long after former President Bill Clinton signed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 that agricultural exports began flowing into Cuba. Five  later, however, the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control quietly tightened a provision that requires Cuban importers to pay in cash in advance for shipments. By changing the meaning of the statutory term cashinadvance from cashbeforetransfer of title to cashbeforeshipment, Treasury essentially made it so payments would have to be received in advance of shipments leaving port in the U.S. rather than upon receipt at the Cuban port. It caused Cuban buyers to fear losing both their payments and their shipments, while pushing up transaction fees. The latest White House action, which a Treasury official asserts will be implemented in the coming weeks, rolls back that change and takes away some of the uncertainty Cuba felt when dealing with U.S. exporters. But National Farmers Union President Roger Johnson and University of Florida agricultural economist William Messina  the big pay off for U.S. farm exports will come only if Congress lifts the embargo completely, allowing U.S. banks to finance trade. Because the embargo is still in place, all sales must still be made in cash using thirdparty financing that often forces exporters and importers to deal with added currencies and exchange rates, making trade more expensive. While U.S. farm exports to Cuba became quite robust over the past decade, despite the cash requirements, they have begun to decline as countries, such as Vietnam, Brazil and Argentina, have begun to ramp up investment in Cuba and offer financing that U.S. exporters cannot match, Messina . Not having the ability to finance the shipping of rice to Cuba, for example, has given producers in Asia a tremendous advantage, Messina . The U.S. was exporting a lot of rice to Cuba in 2006, 2007 and 2008 until exporters in Vietnam and Thailand began to offer financing for as long as two  on the rice sales, he recounted. The quality is not nearly as good as U.S. rice, and the shipping costs are much higher. Corn shipments also have suffered. The U.S. sold nearly 800,000 metric tons of corn to Cuba in 2008 providing nearly all of the countrys import needs for the , according to USDA data compiled by Messina. In 2013, the U.S. sold just 200,000 metric tons to the island nation with the rest of Cubas imports coming from Argentina and Brazil. Overall, U.S. agriculture exports to Cuba this  are expected to drop to just $300 million worth of commodities, the lowest amount in 10 , Messina . Thats far below the the apex of $700 million in 2008, according to the economist, who has worked together with professors at the University of Havana for  to research the trends. The Obama administration did as much as they could, but really, at the end of the day, its the permanent law that needs to be changed,  Zach Kinne, director of public policy for the National Corn Growers Association. Much of the agriculture industrys focus and lobbying for an end to the embargo will be directed at Rep. Paul Ryan, who will be taking over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, who will get the gavel for the Finance Committee,  Dave Salmonsen, senior director of congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Neither lawmaker is making sounds that indicate they are in the mood to further open trade with Cuba, however. The presidents decision to begin talks to normalize relations with Cuba is another example of his administrations habit of appeasing our adversaries, Hatch  in a Dec. 17 statement. Time and again, President Obama has predicated his foreign policy on the notion that if we simply accommodate the demands of troublesome regimes, they will cease their disturbing behavior. Like many of my colleagues, I remain committed to a Cuba policy that continues to place pressure on the Castro regime until the Cuban people are free. And although Ryan advocated for an end to the embargo on Cuba early in his political career, The New York Times reported that the Wisconsin Republican made a 180degree turn when he ran for vice president on the Mitt Romney ticket. The Times quoted Ryan in a Sept. 22, 2012, article as calling the Castro regime brutal and stressing that Obamas policy of appeasement is not working. Still, Johnson is optimistic. Now that the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, Republican lawmakers will feel the need to get things done that are popular with voters, Johnson , and lifting the embargo could well fit the bill. While maybe theres a propensity to say no to whatever Obama wants, theres also this political need to do something that can get passed into law, he added.',\n",

       " 'China tries again to join WTO procurement pact By Victoria Guida POLITICO 1/6/15 2:57 PM EST China has offered to extend preferential access to more types of government contracts in yet another bid to join the World Trade Organizations Government Procurement Agreement, but sources say the proposal has several major flaws. Beijing has proposed lowering the threshold for the size of a contract that may receive nondiscriminatory treatment under the 45member plurilateral pact, bringing those limits down to about $200,000 for foreign bids on supplies and services. Jean Heilman Grier, former senior procurement negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and now a principal at the consulting firm Djaghe,  Chinas offer would bring the contractsize thresholds down to about the same level as other participants in the pact. However, China wants to have two  to transition to those levels after joining the agreement, a revised version of which went into effect in April of last . The agreement allows for such transitional measures for developing countries, but whether China fits that definition is something the parties to the agreement will have to determine, Grier . I think thats really going to be a big issue: whether or not China should be able to be eligible for transitional measures. It was intended for countries that truly are developing, she . All the same, she , the lowered thresholds show that Beijing is now getting serious about bringing this to closure, adding that it was a significant improvement over Chinas last offer. That seems to me like a major development, Grier added. The proposal is Chinas sixth bid to join the GPA. All GPA members in negotiating their thresholds must strike a balance between covering as many procurement contracts as possible and avoiding the administrative burden of making every little purchase eligible, she . China also added five provinces Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hainan to its offer, meaning it has now suggested covering 15 of its 22 provinces. For comparison, 37 of the 50 U.S. states have agreed to be covered under the procurement agreement. Grier  she thought Beijing would probably have to add a few more provinces before being allowed to joint the pact. In addition to the size of contracts, China also has added new services that foreign companies would be allowed to provide, including legal, urban planning, software implementation, buildingcleaning and garbagedisposal services. Grier  Beijings services offer is still far from equivalent to other parties, adding that it was difficult to say how long the list would need to be because the commercial relevance of the sectors tends to matter more than the number of sectors covered. The U.S. allows all but a handful of services sectors to be covered by the agreement. China also expanded the number of construction services that it would allow under the agreement, though most parties to the GPA cover all construction services, according to Grier. In addition, Beijing more than doubled the list of other entities that it would include in the deal; that category would generally include stateowned enterprises, but China added only one China Post Group. Many of the additions are universities and hospitals. It also removed additional restrictions surrounding the other entities listed there. Beijings refusal to list stateowned enterprises, particularly in significant areas like electric utility services, has been a huge point of criticism of all of Chinas offers thus far, Grier . Also potentially problematic is a note in Chinas offer in which it reserves the right to apply domesticcontent requirements or the transfer of technology from foreign companies participating in procurement bids, she added. Thats going to be an issue, she . Chinas offer also still does not cover its military. USTR praised Chinas new offer, which Beijing released before the end of 2014 in compliance with the commitment it made to the U.S. at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue last , but added that the proposal did not go far enough in several areas. We welcome the new offer and note some significant improvements, such as the lowering of certain thresholds and increased entity coverage, a USTR spokesman . However, our initial review suggests that significant gaps remain. We plan to consult soon with China and other GPA members to discuss the offer and determine next steps in the accession negotiations.',\n",

The new offer, circulated to GPA parties on Dec. 23, is China sixth since launching its accession negotiations in 2008, although it is formally known as the fifth revised offer. The spokesman  the U.S. plans to \"consult soon with China and other GPA Members to discuss the offer and determine next steps in the accession negotiations.\" On entity coverage, the primary improvement in China offer is on subcentral government entities. Specifically, the new offer adds five provinces of Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hainan to the list of subcentral jurisdictions that would open up their procurement to foreign bidders from GPA signatories. This is on top of the 10 provinces and four municipalities listed in China previous offer, tabled in December 2013. But it falls short of the U.S. request for China to cover all of its 22 provinces, four municipalities and five autonomous regions. Beijing has proposed a staged approach under which some of its provinces and municipalities would be covered immediately when the GPA enters into force for China, while others would be covered three  after that date. All of the five new provinces in China latest offer would be placed in the latter category. China new offer lowers thresholds across the board for central, subcentral, and other government entities while maintaining an approach of phasing them in over three . In some cases, China new thresholds are in line with those applied by other GPA parties. This is the case for the thresholds for central government entities, which would be phased in after three  to 130,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for goods and services and 5 million SDRs for construction services. These are the same thresholds which the U.S. and the European Union apply to central government entities and which the U.S. had demanded China adopt. China previous offer had proposed phasing its thresholds on central government entities to 200,000 SDRs for goods and services and 15 million for construction services. One SDR, a standard of value used by the International Monetary Fund and based on a basket of major currencies, was valued at approximately $1.43 on Jan. 6. On subcentral entities, China new offer lowers the thresholds that will be applied from the third  to 355,000 SDRs for goods and services and 15 million SDRs for construction services. This is partly in line with the U.S., which currently applies a threshold of 355,000 SDRs for procurement of goods and services and 5 million SDRs for construction services. But the U.S. in a 2012 request for improvements had demanded that China lower the thresholds for subcentral entities to 200,000 SDRs for goods and services and 5 million SDRs for construction services. Those are the thresholds currently applied by the EU for subcentral entities. China new offer also reduces the thresholds that would apply to other government entities listed in Annex 3, which is where GPA parties typically list SOEs. Under the new offer, the thresholds beginning in the third  for such entities would be set at 400,000 SDRs for goods and services, and 15 million SDRs for construction services. This is partly in line with the thresholds applied by the U.S. and EU, which both apply thresholds of 400,000 SDRs or lower for goods and services and 5 million SDRs for construction services. The U.S. in 2012 had demanded that China lower these thresholds to 160,000 SDRs and 5 million SDRs respectively. With respect to SOEs, China new offer still falls far short of U.S. demands that Beijing cover any stateowned or stateinvested firms that conduct procurement for government purposes or are \"created, established, or otherwise authorized to undertake infrastructure or other construction projects for government purposes.\" That , the new offer does add some new entities such as China Post Group, the Agricultural Development Bank of China and several hospitals and universities to its Annex 3. China new offer retains two out of three broad exclusions to GPA rules that other parties had found objectionable. The first exclusion maintained in China new offer allows China to deviate from the GPA nondiscrimination rules in certain procurements when not doing so would impair \" national policy objectives.\" The second one allows China to require the incorporation of domestic content, transfer of technology or other offset measures for covered procurements. Both are included in Annex 7, which lists \"general notes\" to coverage. However, China new offer does remove a third broad exclusion to coverage of central government entities that many GPA parties had urged China to drop. That restriction, present in China previous offers, had limited coverage of central government entities to their offices in Beijing. While the improvements on coverage and thresholds were highlighted as significant by USTR, China new offer also includes other changes. For instance, it expands coverage of services by including five new sectors and seven new subsectors of construction services. The five new service sectors that China proposes to cover are legal services; urban planning services; software implementation services; buildingcleaning services; and refuse disposal services, not including disposal of radioactive waste. But these service sectors continue to be defined more narrowly than the U.S. has requested. This is because they are all listed using three or more digits of the Central Products Classifcation (CPC) code, while the U.S. has called for China to make services commitments using the broader twodigit CPC code. Among the seven new subsectors of construction services are construction work for warehouses and industrial buildings; educational buildings; health buildings and \"other buildings.\" The other three new subsectors are construction work for civil engineering, and special trade construction work for foundations and water well drilling.',\n",
       " 'Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed hails WTOs move to hold meeting in Kenya BY Luke Anami The Standard January 7th 2015 at 00:00 GMT +3 Foreign Affairs and International Trade Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has welcomed the World Trade Organisations (WTO) decision to hold the 10th ministerial conference (MC10) in Nairobi this . She says the move is a boost to the financial sectors in the country. The conference that will take place from December 15 to 18, in Nairobi, is the topmost decisionmaking body that meets every two . It brings together all WTO members countries or customs unions. Hosting the WTO ministerial conference would be a huge boost to our economy as it is likely to influence future investments, Ms Mohamed . We expect to receive visitors from all parts of the world a move that will have a direct bearing on the service sectors including banking and hospitality industry. Kenya made its request to host MC10 on behalf of all African countries, both the 42 that are WTO members and those that are still in the process of accession. The move makes it the first African country to host the WTO ministerial conference since 1996. Food security The last conference was held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013, where ministers adopted the Bali Package a series of decisions aimed at streamlining trade. The move allowed developing countries more options for providing food security, boosting leastdeveloped countries trade and generally accelerating development. When WTO members arrive in Kenya this  for our tenth ministerial conference, let members know they will be hosted by the entire continent of Africa, the CS . Ms Amina expects more than two thirds, if not all of the WTO members, to ratify the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). This will see the agreement come into force before the tenth ministerial conference. We would also like to see consensus on a broadbased, balanced PostBali Work Programme that responds to the imperatives of the global economy for recovery, growth, jobs and development that is sustainable and safeguards our planet, Ms Mohamed  at the WTO General Council meeting in Geneva, late last . The TFA negotiations were concluded in December 2013 at the Bali Ministerial Conference. TFA is expected to improve movement of goods on transit and ease release and clearance among WTO member countries. It is expected to reduce costs that accrue during the movement of goods across borders by reducing paperwork, declaration forms, penalties, and time taken to clear goods at points of entry such as ports and or border crossings. The TFA will come into force once twothirds of members have completed their domestic ratification process. The last time Kenya hosted a key international trade conference, the African Growth Opportunity Act (Agoa) forum, was in 2010, where President Barrack Obamas administration was represented by the then Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton.',\n",
       " 'Canada, Mexico Seek To Overturn Sole U.S. Win In COOL Compliance Decision World Trade Online Posted: January 6, 2015 Canada and Mexico have both filed separate appeals at the World Trade Organization that aim to overturn the sole victory that a WTO compliance panel granted to the United States in a dispute over the U.S. countryoforigin labeling (COOL) regime for beef and pork. The target of the Canadian and Mexican appeals which are roughly the same is the compliance panel ruling that an amended U.S. labeling regulation did not violate Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), which requires technical measures to be no more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. That ruling was consistent with the earlier decision of the WTO Appellate Body, which was evaluating the original COOL regulation at the center of the dispute. Both the compliance panel and Appellate Body found that providing consumers with information through labeling was a legitimate objective, and that neither Canada nor Mexico had sufficiently shown how alternative options would be less traderestrictive than the U.S. COOL measure. Despite that ruling by the compliance panel, the U.S. still took a major blow when the panel found the amended regulation had not made the measure any less discriminatory a violation of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement and had in fact made things worse for Canadian and Mexican livestock producers. Canada and Mexico make a handful of arguments in trying to tackle the compliance panel decision with regard to Article 2.2. Among them is the compliance panel alleged failure to fully analyze how each of the COOL regime components contribute to its objective. The compliance panel largely focused on three countryoforigin labels known as Labels A, B, and C because Canada and Mexico had complained that these labels were in violation of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement. Canada and Mexico did not raise these complaints with respect to the two other labels, Labels D and E, nor did they propose alternative measures for them. Because of this, the panel excluded two labels from its analysis of Article 2.2. Label A is for meat products that are from the U.S., while Labels B and C are for meat products that are born, raised and slaughtered in multiple countries. Meanwhile, Label D is solely for meat products from one country, while Label E is for ground meat products that could contain multiple countries of origin. Mexico, in its appeal filing,  the compliance panel had failed to \"properly consider and take into account the design and operation of Label E (the ground beef label) in its assessment of the amended COOL measure degree of contribution to the fulfillment of the legitimate objective.\" Both Canada and Mexico also took issue with the way the compliance panel had conducted its analysis, but did not fully flesh out those arguments in their Dec. 12 filings. They also objected to what they  was a failure by the panel to sufficiently assess the alternative measures they had proposed. The Appellate Body, in its 2012 ruling,  it was not able to fully evaluate the other options because the panel had not analyzed them in its decision. Under WTO rules, the Appellate Body can only examine legal questions, but cannot reopen the factual record. In their new appeals, Canada and Mexico are also asking the Appellate Body review of all five of the labels in terms of whether COOL rule violates Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, Canada specifically went out of the way to say it was not taking issue with the compliance panel overall determination that the COOL measure violated Article 2.1',\n",

       " 'RoO being used as nontariff barrier to exports from LDCs 7 January 2015 The Financial Express (Bangladesh) Bangladesh, Jan. 7 Trade experts made a fervent call for building the country traderelated capacity, getting the rules of origin further relaxed and strengthening the infrastructural backbone of the economy to help an optimum expansion of the export market. The suggestions came from a roundtable discussion on \\'Bali Decision on Preferential Rules of Origin for LDCs: Issues for Bangladesh\\', as strict RoO tags restrict access of the country products to different overseas markets. Speakers at the meet highlighted the urgency of taking measures for relaxing the trade rules as Bangladesh is entitled to have preferential treatment to its exports by virtue of being a leastdeveloped country. Rules of Origin (RoO) are a set of principles applied to determine the originating status of a product imported into a countryessentially fixing a certain amount of local value addition to the item. But the RoO, according to the speakers, are frequently being used as nontariff barriers to offer protection to domestic markets from competition. And this tool deprives the LDCs of the benefits associated with the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). To protect the nation interests, the meeting also underscored effectively negotiating the issue, along with other LDCs, with the developed countries. The Committee of Rules of Origin reviews the developments time to time in line with the global trading regime. Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) and Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI) jointly organized the conference at the MCCI conference hall to assess the impacts of rules of origin on export and find ways of making it more productive. \"The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) have been seeking flexible rulesoforigin criteria since the launch of the DDA (Doha Development Agenda) negotiations, to better utilise the preferences accorded to them,\"  Dr. Mustafa Abid Khan. Mr Khan, acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI), presented the keynote on the topic of talk on the tricky trade issues. MCCI President Syed Nasim Manzur, who presided over the meeting, also underscored the need for a flexible and simplified set of rules of origin and strengthening bilateral trade negotiations with individual countries. \"There is confusion about export of pharmaceutical products from LDCs after 2016 as it will need extension of international intellectual property protection rules,\"  the MCCI president, suggesting more focus on this matter. The conference was also addressed, among others, by Hedayetullah Al Mamoon, Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, additional secretary Monoj Kumar Roy, DirectorGeneral of the WTO cell of the commerce ministry Amitava Chakraborty and FBCCI adviser Manzur Ahmed. To get to the goal of building up a middleincome country by the  2021, commerce secretary Hedayetullah Al Mamoon stressed taking some future strategic plans. \"We should negotiate, along with other LDCs, with developed countries for relaxing the rules of origin right now,\" he . Speakers, mainly officials from related government and private organisations and trade bodies, also underscored the need for increasing the country negotiating capacity especially in value addition and tariff classification, active involvement in various bilateral and multilateral negotiations for other preferential trade arrangements. According to the keynote paper, the LDCs have been benefiting from the LDCspecific generous rules of origin of the GSP schemes of the EU and Canada. For Bangladesh, growth of export is higher in the EU, Canada, China and Japan. For the LDCs, the WTO Bali conference was of high importance. In line with the work programme agreed upon in Bali, subsequent negotiations will require a proactive engagement on the part of LDCs. The Bali decision, thus, obligates the LDCs to do the necessary homework and pursue and advance their interests through future trade negotiations. Bangladesh needs to be very careful at multilateral discussions and is required to develop its expertise to achieve goals,  one participant. He also stressed the need for increase in efficiency and developing infrastructure besides work for relaxing the strict rules of origin.',\n",
       " 'Sausage row reveals German disquiet over trade talks Jeevan Vasagar in Berlin Financial Times January 6, 2015 5:51 pm A small grilled sausage from Bavaria has become the unlikely symbol of German resistance to the transatlantic trade deal being negotiated between the EU and the US, after the countrys agriculture minister warned that not every sausage can be protected in the trade talks. Christian Schmidt, Germanys agriculture minister,  in an interview with Der Spiegel: If we want to seize the opportunities of free trade with the enormous American market then we cant carry on protecting every sausage and cheese speciality. Food producers, politicians and campaigners against the trade deal seized on his remarks as evidence that the protection of regional brands would be sacrificed to globalisation. While GM food and investor protection rules remain the most contentious aspects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the agriculture ministers remarks provoked an outcry in support of the Nrnberger Rostbratwurst, a fingersized pork sausage from Nuremberg which is protected as a regional speciality by the EU. Progress in the trade talks between the US and the EU to create what would be the worlds biggest free trade bloc has been slow, and there is growing public scepticism towards the deal, particularly in Germany. Anne Vollmer, spokeswoman for the BVE, a lobby group for the German food and drink industry, : Regional specialities must remain regional specialities. We dont want Nrnberger Rostbratwurst from Kentucky, and Tennessee whiskey from Baden Baden. The seal stands for a designated quality and a designated expertise. The sausage in question has been subject to strict local regulation since the 14th century; in the Middle Ages, Nrnberger Rostbratwurst failing to meet the city authorities quality standards were dumped into the Pegnitz river, which runs through the Bavarian city of Nuremberg. The ministers spokesman later issued a clarification, offering support for protected geographical indications the EU appellation that covers foodstuffs such as Parma ham and Roquefort. But the spokesman  he believed the rules should be implemented consistently, so that it was clear to Americans that Europeans were keeping to their own standards. There are, time and again, problems with Feta cheese, which may only come from Greece and Cyprus, the minister  in a subsequent interview in which he attempted to damp down the row. One hears of companies that produce Feta cheese in Denmark. Less than 70 German foodstuffs were offered protection under EU rules in 2010, the last  for which comparable figures are available, including also Westphalian ham and Allgauer Weisslacker, a kind of Bavarian cheese. Whereas in France 170 products fall under the protection of the EU and 170 in Italy. But the products generate significant economic value; sales of Germanys protected products generated revenues of just over 3.3bn in 2010, according to EU figures, compared with 3bn for French food and drink products. The ministers comments have fuelled German suspicions that the TTIP negotiations favour larger corporate interests over consumer protection and Mittelstand or smaller food producers. Maritta Strasser, a campaigner at Campact, a German advocacy group which campaigns against TTIP, : In general, this debate is an example of the danger that TTIP poses. Transparent information for consumers and high standards fall by the wayside, thats what we fear, because big multinational concerns have exclusive access to the negotiating parties. Daniel Rosario, spokesman for the EU, insisted that TTIP would not undermine European food brands or weaken intellectual property safeguards. On the EU side, we have made clear to our American counterparts that geographical indications are one of our main priorities and we have not agreed and will not agree to reduce the protection of our geographical indications in Europe, he .

       " 'Food Min floats proposal to cut food subsidy Sanjeeb Mukherjee 7 January 2015 Business Standard The food ministry has floated a proposal that the subsidy for running grainbased welfare schemes other than the Public Distribution System (PDS) should be borne by the departments concerned and not transferred to the account of the ministry, a plan which would reduce the amount of food subsidy. This has become all the more imperative as the National Food Security Act (NFSA), once fully implemented across the country, would cover more than half of Indias population, negating the need for allocating grains separately for other departments. At present, the department of food and public distribution not only supplies wheat and rice for the Public Distribution System (PDS) but also for schemes like midday meal, which is run by ministry of human resource development, nutrition programmes run by the ministry of women and child development and also welfare homes like jails, nariniketans etc. However, the entire subsidy of these programmes run by other ministries and departments is billed to the department of food, which inflates its already high subsidy. According to the proposal, the subsidy accruing to all these departments and schemes should be borne by them and not passed on the food department. This in one go should lower the food subsidy by some amount as the subsidy on one scheme alone was somewhere around Rs 2,750 crore in 201314, a senior official . The total food subsidy stood at Rs 92,000 crore in 201314 against Rs 85,000 a  earlier. For the current , the subsidy is pegged at Rs 1,15,000. However, in the broader context, the plan would transfer subsidy from one account to another and not bring down the subsidy burden on the exchequer, the official . He, however,  the change in accounting will help in reflecting a true picture of the expenditure being made on a scheme and would also lead to better control and ownership of the scheme by the department concerned. Redistribution of the food subsidy would also make it more compliant with the WTO. Recently, a highlevel panel held discussions on the issue. The ninemember panel, chaired by Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, also comprises Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Power Minister Piyush Goyal, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian and Food Secretary Sudhir Kumar. The panel has been set up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The food law has been rolled out in only 11 states and Union Territories. The Centre has given time till April 4 for other states for its full implementation. The law aims to provide legal entitlement to 5 kg of subsidised foodgrains per person per month at Rs 13/kg to twothird of the country population.',\n",
       " 'Tamil Nadu leads in ensuring GI protection in India C.H. Unnikrishnan 7 January 2015 Mint Mumbai, Jan. 7 Tamil Nadu has emerged as the top India state to protect its natural products and industrial skills by filing the highest number of geographical indications (GI) since India established the system of protecting such intellectual property (IP) rights in 2003. GI is an IP tag on natural and industrial products and traditional skills that is exclusively associated with a particular place of origin. This not only protects the commercial rights to these assets but also helps the local community to reap their benefits. Typically, a GI tag conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness, essentially attributable to the fact of its origin. Tamil Nadu has so far registered 24 geographical indications, which include the rights for the popular Kanchipuram silk and Thanjavur paintings. It has filed 26 more applications for geographical indications that are still pending, taking the total to 50. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra were joint second with 39 GIs (both registered and pending) till December 2014. Goa and Punjab claimed the least with two each. India, as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), enacted the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act in 1999, and the law came into force with effect from September 2003. A higher number of GI registrations from a state indicates the diverse resource pool and skills set that it can claim for exclusive commercial exploitation. It also reflects the level of IP awareness in order to protect the traditional assets in the new IPdriven economy. India GI registry, which is part of the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, has for the first time updated the data on total GI registrations and filings in the country from September 2003 to December 2014 (the entire period for which the GI regime has been in effect). Geographical indications have also been registered in India by foreign countries for tapping the local market. One of the most popular among such foreign assets registered in India is Scotch whisky, registered by the UK since 2009. Although the India GI registry has a list of some 490 geographical indications, there are only nine from overseas. These include Champagne and Cognac from France, Parma ham from Italy, Tequila from Mexico, Porto and Douro from Portugal and the range of wines from Napa Valley in the US. Some wellknown products protected by India states include Darjeeling tea, Tirupati laddu from Andhra Pradesh, Muga silk from Assam, Goa Feni, Kashmir Pashmina wool, Mysore Agarbathi, Bangalore Blue Grapes, Alleppey Coir and Malabar Pepper. A GI is registered for an initial period of 10 , which may be renewed from time to time.',\n",

       " 'World Bank sees slower track for global trade engine WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) Global trade should expand more slowly over the next decade than it did in the 30  before the financial crisis, the World Bank  on Wednesday, citing forecasts for slower economic growth and longerterm shifts in trade patterns. For the three decades leading up to the global financial crisis of 20072009, trade had expanded at a steady clip of about 7 percent a . But trade growth levels have fallen to about half that for the past two , and should only rise to about 5 percent over the mediumterm, four World Bank economists  in an essay. International trade helped the global economy tide over rough spots in the two decades before the financial crisis, when it grew nearly twice as fast as economic output. But recent data shows the trade engine is running out of steam. The authors point to the lackluster recovery from the financial crisis, which the World Bank expects to persist. And data shows import demand levels may be a fifth lower than they would be otherwise even five  after an economic crisis. Weak spending on investment since the crisis, especially in the euro zone, has also sapped trade growth. Investment is especially reliant on imports compared to other economic drivers like consumption and government spending. But deeper factors have also tamped down trade expansion. China reduction of trade barriers and the fragmentation of production into global supply chains boosted trade at the end of the last century, factors that would be hard to replicate now. Countries like the United States and China are also making more inputs for final products closer to home, the economists write. \"Global trade is growing more slowly not only because world income growth is lower, but also because trade has become less responsive to income growth,\" according to the essay. Policymakers are hoping farreaching regional and global trade pacts could help trade growth regain some lost momentum. The World Bank  more integration of South Asia, subSaharan Africa and South America into global supply chains would also help. \"Drawing these parts of the world into a finer division of labor could lend renewed dynamism to trade,\" the bank .

       " 'China rare earths quotas go, possible new moves stoke supply doubts By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Jan 7 (Reuters) China move to scrap export quotas on rare earths, crucial in most modern technology, may not mean an end to the uncertainty over supplies because the top producer can still find ways to control shipments and influence prices, industry players . China, which supplies about 90 percent of the world rare earths needs, imposed export restrictions and raised tariffs in 2010 as it sought higher prices to help cover the huge environmental costs of production and tried to encourage the growth of domestic industries that use rare earths. Prices shot up as buyers scrambled to secure supplies, leading Japan, Europe and the United States to file a trade complaint. The World Trade Organization ruled last  that China restrictions were discriminatory and told it to scrap the quotas and export tariffs. In response, Beijing announced in late December it was ending the quotas. However, that is not expected to affect supply or prices, as China has not filled its export quotas over the past three  anyway, analysts and the world only nonChinese producers of rare earths, Australia Lynas Corp and U.S. firm Molycorp,  on Wednesday. \"We don\\'t think it\\'ll affect our volume significantly. It not like there going to suddenly be a flood of product coming on to the market,\" Lynas CEO Amanda Lacaze told Reuters. \"What is more of an issue is the sort of uncertainty overhang in the market that has been there since the WTO ruling. We saw this in the last quarter, where we had customers drawing down inventories rather than buy fresh product.\" That sent prices for various rare earths elements down by as much as 20 percent in the December quarter, Lacaze . Beijing is expected to unveil new regulations for rare earth mining, processing and exports, perhaps including a valueadded tax to replace the export tariff, which could have some impact, Lacaze and a Molycorp spokesman . \"There a very, very strong market view that there will be a production or environment tax of some sort introduced in China,\" Lacaze told Reuters in a phone interview from Kuantan in Malaysia, where Lynas runs its rare earths separation plant. Rare earth elements include lanthanum used in oil refineries; neodymium and praseodymium used in magnets for motors; dyprosium used in hybrid vehicles, wind turbines and stealth helicopters; and yttrium in military jet engines. STILL IN CONTROL American Elements, a U.S. buyer of rare earths that depends on supply from China,  Beijing had been sophisticated in coming up with policies to drive growth of domestic industries that use rare earths by controlling exports and consolidating production and processing among six stateowned entities. American Elements CEO Michael Silver  China plan to introduce export licences would ensure Beijing controlled supplies. \"Control through Baotou (Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel RareEarth HiTech Co Ltd ) and the government deciding who gets the export licences should help support rare earths export prices,\" Silver told Reuters by phone from Colorado. But if China decided it wanted to flood the market with rare earths, it could, he added. That fear led investors to knock Molycorp shares down 10 percent on Tuesday after media reported China had scrapped the export quotas. Lynas shares fell 9 percent on Tuesday but inched up on Wednesday. Both stocks are just above record lows hit in December. The two companies are saddled with debt and have struggled to bring their plants up to full capacity, but Lacaze  she remained confident her company would achieve a cash breakeven position in the December or March quarter.

       " 'Commerce Says It May Slash AD Rates Under First China Solar Case, Following Review World Trade Online Posted: January 7, 2015 The U.S. Department of Commerce has  it may significantly lower the antidumping (AD) duties currently facing Chinese exporters of solar cells, after concluding a preliminary review of the first trade solar trade remedy order against China that was imposed in 2012. Commerce  in a Jan. 2 filing that it has preliminarily found dumping margins of 1.82 percent for most exporters through its administrative review of the AD order, which examined the period of May 2012 through November 2013. The only exporters not receiving the 1.82 percent duty rate were those Commerce  had not shown they were independent from the Chinese government, which will face a heavy duty of 238.56 percent. The current range of AD duties facing exporters is between 18.32 and 31.73 percent, with a weighted average of 25.96 percent assigned to companies not individually investigated who qualified for a separate rate. The original Chinawide dumping margin is 249.96 percent. Commerce preliminary findings will not have any effect until it finalizes its review, a step that is due by May but could be extended until July. Commerce is weighing dropping the duties so low for the bulk of the nongovernment controlled solar cell exporters because of a quirk in the review proceedings. Specifically, it found mandatory respondent Yingli had a dumping margin during the period of review of just 1.82 percent, while the other respondent that Commerce decided to individually investigate, Wuxi Suntech, was ultimately unable to prove it was not government controlled. Normally, Commerce would use the weighted average dumping margin of the two privately controlled companies it selected to individually investigate in setting the rate for other firms that had proved they were not government entities. But because Yingli was the only mandatory respondent in the review found to be independent from the Chinese government, Commerce simply assigned the other private companies the same margin as Yingli. Meanwhile, Commerce in its review of a parallel countervailing duty (CVD) order did not find wildly different subsidy margins than it initially had. In the final 2012 determination, the department found margins of 14.78 and 15.97 percent for two individual exporters, respectively, and assigned an average of 15.24 percent. After its preliminary administrative review, it found margins of 8.63 and 22.73 percent for the two exporters it selected leaving the average roughly the same at 15.68 percent. The announcement comes just weeks after Commerce on Dec. 16 announced its final determination in a second set of AD and CVD cases against solar energy products from China and Taiwan, leveling high duties against both. The scope of that case against China is different than the 2012 case, covering solar panels from China regardless of where the cells originate. But the lowering of the duties in the older case even if finalized may not have a major commercial impact. The petitioner in both cases, SolarWorld Americas, has complained that the original case did little to slow imports of solar energy products from China because Chinese firms reconfigured the sourcing of their cells specifically by importing from Taiwan in order to avoid being hit by the duties. Still, one respondent lawyer signaled that the lowering of the duties may give Chinese exporters more flexibility in their supply chains because it would be more feasible costwise to use cells produced in China even though the goods would be subject to the 2012 trade remedy order. Commerce announcement was welcomed by the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy (CASE), which represents solar array installers and other parts of the industry supply chain in the U.S. and has opposed the trade investigations on the basis that they increase the cost of solar energy. \"Lowering the tariff import tax means more American consumers will be able to afford solar power and more American solar companies will be able to expand their hiring,\" Jigar Shah, CASE president and founder of SunEdison, in a Jan. 5 statement. \"While this is positive news, it does not solve the underlying problem. The U.S. solar industry remains unfairly penalized by a trade policy that inflates the cost of solar power and has already expanded to include imports from Taiwan,\" Shah added. \"We continue to urge the governments of the United States and China to negotiate an end to the trade war for the benefit of all countries involved.\" In a related development, Commerce has turned down a request by SolarWorld to evaluate how the alleged cyber theft of its confidential financial and strategic business information including with regard to the trade case may have impacted the AD/CVD proceedings in the 2012 investigation. In a Dec. 29 letter to Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley Rein and lawyer for SolarWorld, Commerce Enforcement and Compliance Director Edward Yang wrote that the allegations, while serious, did not fall within the scope of reasons that the department could use as a basis to conduct a \"changed circumstances review\" of the case. \"While these allegations raise serious concerns standing alone, the claims do not suggest that information submitted to the Department by the Government of the [People Republic of China] or the company respondents during the course of the underlying investigations was inaccurate as a result of the alleged cyber espionage or that the alleged cyber espionage otherwise led to the AD and CVD determinations and orders being based on inaccurate information,\" Yang wrote. Earlier last month, Commerce also  it had rejected SolarWorld request to investigate the hacking investigations as part of the newer AD/CVD case. Specifically, SolarWorld had asked for Commerce to query the government of China in context of the CVD case to which Beijing is a respondent, in contrast to the AD case, which involves only the companies about the information it had obtained, and make an adverse inference if it failed to adequately respond. That would have potentially driven up CVD duties, but the strategy was seen as a long shot at best by lawyers close to Chinese respondents. SolarWorld claims were based on an indictment of five members of the Chinese military who allegedly hacked into the computers of six U.S. entities, including SolarWorld, during a period from 2006 to 2014. The SolarWorld theft occurred in 2012 and included files with information about the company cash flow, manufacturing metrics, production line information, costs, and privileged attorneyclient communications relating to the trade litigation, according to the summary of the indictment from the Department of Justice.',\n",
       " 'Chinese solar sector under renewed scrutiny Nicholas Hirst; 8 January 2015 European Voice Fresh probe into Chinese solar glass industry will raise questions about how the Commission dealt with China dumping of solar panels into the EU market and the country suitability to gain market economy status at the WTO. The European Commission has reopened a trade investigation into the Chinese solar power sector in the face of evidence that tariffs imposed in May 2014 were too low to prevent products from being dumped onto the European market, putting more local rivals out of business. Stakeholders have until the end of this week to submit comments on whether tariffs of up to 36% on Chinese imports of solar glass are too low, as claimed by EU Pro Sun Glass, a body representing European manufacturers of photovoltaic glass. The 201314 investigation into Chinese solar glass imports was overshadowed by a parallel investigation into Chinese solar panel exporters. Like Europe’s solar glass manufacturers, solar panel makers in 2012 complained that Chinese competitors enjoyed fat subsidies allowing them to sell their products at a loss on the European market, undercutting European rivals. The danger, warned the Europeans, was that once all European competition was eliminated, the Chinese firms could dictate their price. With an EU market worth €20 billion, the solar panel case was the largest trade case ever conducted by the Commission. Karel De Gucht, the European commissioner for trade from 201014, initially concluded that Chinese firms enjoyed subsidies and loans allowing them to sell at a discount of 88%. But he buckled under the pressure of lobbying by China and member states such as Germany, who were wary of hurting commercial relations with the emerging economy. A settlement was agreed with the Chinese and De Gucht also dropped an investigation into Chinese telecom imports. The solar panel settlement, which set a minimum price for a limited volume of imports after which duties would apply, is now the subject of several legal challenges by European Union solar panel producers. They argue that the EU should have followed the United States in imposing tariffs of more than 50%. In a double blow, EU solar panel manufacturers were further hurt by the Commission’s eventual decision to impose tariffs on imports of solar glass, an  input for EU solar panel manufacturers. With a market value of around €200 million, that investigation was far less sensitive than the solar panel case. The Commission is now reviewing whether that tariff is too low. Such a conclusion would give further ammunition to EU firms opposed to China gaining market economy status at the World Trade Organisation. AEGIS, a coalition of 20 EU industry associations, warned in December that granting China market economy status threatened EU jobs and growth. Milan Nitzschke, spokesman of the EU solar photovoltaic manufacturers and a member of AEGIS, : “China is as far from being a market economy as Pluto is from Earth.” The group welcomed comments by Cecilia Malmström, the commissioner for trade, who in December suggested that China would not ‘automatically’ gain market economy status in 2016, as argued by some.',\n",
       " 'Industry opposes antidumping duty levied on pen drives Rajesh Kurup & Rahul Wadke 8 January 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) Lack of domestic capacity will impactthe demandsupply equation The government’s proposal to impose antidumping duties on Chinese and Taiwanese pen drives is being opposed by the industry, fearing a rise in prices that would result in grey market spread. The sector is also confused over the provenance of the devices, while domestic companies’ lacking of the ability to manufacture these would impact the demandsupply equation. The Directorate General of AntiDumping & Allied Duties (DGAD) has proposed to levy duties of $3.12 (Rs 199) per unit imported from China and $3.06 ( Rs. 195) for those from Taiwan. DGAD will now send its findings, which were finalised after an investigation for calendar  2012, to the finance ministry for a final decision. ‘No rationale’ “This will put a huge burden on the consumers. Also there is no rationale of imposing duty on high capacities such as 32 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB or USB 3.0 technology products where domestic players have no demonstrated presence or capability,”  Ashok Chandak, Chairman of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. Flash memories, manufactured in Japan and Korea, are the major costs of USB products and these devices mainly are assembled and tested in China and Taiwan, he added. Antidumping duties are imposed to protect the domestic industry from unfair competition, especially on suspiciously lowpriced imports or goods below cost prices. “The bigger worry is that this will result in emergence of grey market in the country, not to mention the direct impact it would have on prices,”  Anwar Shirpurwala, Executive Director at Manufacturers’ Association of Information Technology (MAIT). According to industry data, the present demand for USB sticks in India is at about 2530 million units per , of which nearly 99 per cent is imports. Global firms “We are confused as to what is Chinese or Taiwanese. These are all global manufacturers – Japanese, South Korean and US firms – and these companies are assembling these devices,”  Vishnu Bhandari, CEO of IT distributor Supertron Electronics. According to the industry, flash drives are IT products covered under WTO Information Technology Agreement List and no custom duty is levied, even though 6 per cent countervailing duty is levied on the MRP. At present, domestic prices of these drives are at par with global prices, while there are about 20,000 channel partners selling these in the country, according to Suresh Pansari, director at distributor Rashi Peripherals.',\n",

On the bilateral level, the Presidency also wants to move forwards with implementation of the free trade agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and to support the necessary procedures for approving the free trade agreements with Canada (CETA) and Singapore. On the multilateral level, the Presidency wants to progress the WTO Doha agenda, following on from the Bali miniagreement that was concluded at the end of 2013, and from the breakthrough that came at the end of 2014 for implementing the agreement on trade facilitation. As well as the Doha negotiations, the Presidency will encourage the negotiations for an international trade in services agreement (TiSA), the negotiations for the green goods initiative, and finalisation of the review of the WTO information technology agreement (ITA). Also on the multilateral level, the Presidency will encourage the ongoing WTO accession negotiations with Algeria, Azerbaijan, BosniaHerzegovina, Kazakhstan and Serbia. It will also support the preparations for the 10th WTO ministerial conference in Nairobi (Kenya) in December. In addition, the Latvian Presidency will monitor implementation of the new generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme set up at the beginning of 2014 particularly as regards the GSP+. Lastly, the Presidency promises to ensure that EU trade policy continues to guarantee enforcement of the EU rights under existing rules and to promote enhanced access to world markets, working on the legislative level for the benefit of all EU stakeholders. The meeting of European trade ministers is scheduled for 7 May. (EH)',\n",

A bill to give the White House fasttrack power, allowing Congress a yesorno vote on trade deals in exchange for setting negotiating goals, did not advance in the last Congress but new legislation will be introduced in 2015. Unions, progressive lawmakers, consumer advocates, environmentalists and social justice and human rights lobbyists will kick off a campaign on Thursday to oppose fasttrack. \"It the start of the new Congress and we are up, up and away,\"  Democrat Rosa DeLauro, citing plans for speeches, letters and meetings, \"the whole nine yards of activity.\" But the administration and business groups, who see the Republicancontrolled Congress as the best chance in  for a trade agenda encompassing deals worth nearly $500 billion a  to the global economy, are pushing the opposite view. In a speech next Wednesday, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue will name fasttrack, or trade promotion authority, as a top priority for the group, which represents more than 3 million American companies. The Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers are lobbying too. \"We are going to be putting a major push, a major campaign, behind getting trade promotion done as soon as possible,\"  the Chamber senior international policy director, Christopher Wenk. \"It going to be around the clock.\" Senior officials are reaching out to Democrats on trade, preparing a snapshot for each state spelling out how each will gain under the 12nation TransPacific Partnership, with a particular focus on labor and environmental protections, a key concern for many Democrats. \"TPP will be the most progressive trade agreement in history,\" a U.S. Trade Representative spokesman . Social media, newspaper advertisements and opinion pieces, pamphlets, facetoface meetings and rallies will be used by both sides as the United States moves to complete the TPP and make progress on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe. Trade experts say fasttrack is key to closing those deals, as it gives trading partners confidence Congress will not pick apart agreements. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  on Wednesday Republicans planned to move quickly with fasttrack legislation and called on President Barack Obama to stand up to opponents. For their part, unions plan to mobilize members to write letters and telephone their members of Congress to tell them they think free trade is bad for jobs. \"We want to engage our members in the fasttrack fight back in their districts,\"  Barbara Coufal, senior official at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has more than 1.6 million members.

The ChinaCELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) gathering comes as China pushes for more influence in what has traditionally been Washington backyard, and with many in the area looking to the Asian nation to offset US dominance. \"China will focus on overall cooperation with Latin American countries and this forum will build a deepening discussion,\" Xi  in a speech televised live from the Great Hall of the People. \"Expanding cooperation discussions at this forum will determine deepening integration with Latin America in the next five  in fields including security, trade, finance, technology, energy, resources, industry and agriculture,\" he .

       " 'EU pushes back against TTIP trade agreement secrecy claims By Christian Oliver in Brussels Financial Times January 7, 2015 5:34 pm The EU has launched a fresh attempt to punch back against accusations that it is trying to conclude a landmark trade deal with the US in secret, publishing eight of its negotiating proposals in key sectors. The documents — which cover topics ranging from food safety to customs issues — are not a comprehensive reflection of what the deal will include but the move is significant because Brussels has never before published specific legal proposals while an agreement is being negotiated. The publication is an attempt to counter a growing swell of opposition from nongovernmental organisations, which argue that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership only serves the interests of big multinational companies and would lower European standards on food, health and the environment. If concluded, TTIP would represent the world’s biggest trade deal. “It is  that everyone can see and understand what we are proposing in TTIP and — just as ly — what we are not,”  Cecilia Malmström, the EU trade commissioner. Bernd Lange, the socialist lawmaker who heads the European Parliament’s trade committee, welcomed the step but pushed for still greater transparency. “The road ahead is still long,” he . Brussels faces a greater public relations battle in the spring, when it will have to decide how to handle the most politically contentious element of the trade deal — clauses that map out the rights of foreign investors to sue governments. This part of the trade accord faces particularly stern resistance in Germany, Europe’s most powerful country, where fears run deep that US companies could bypass national courts and use international arbitrators instead. To the trade negotiators, the socalled Investor State Dispute Settlement clauses are a vital part of the deal that will protect foreign investors. EU leaders  last month that they wanted to conclude TTIP by the end of the  but Ms Malmström cautioned that it was probably realistic to expect only a “skeleton” of a deal by then if all were to go well. One of the main obstacles facing the EU is that the US is closer to finalising another multilateral trade accord with Pacific Rim countries. The fear is that if a deal is not struck in 2015, the looming 2016 US presidential elections mean it would have to wait for a new administration, with negotiations dragging on into 2017 and possibly beyond.

       " 'The U.S.led global economic order is dying By Henry Farrell 7 January 2015 Washington Post.com Jonathan Kirshner is Stephen and Barbara Friedman Professor of International Political Economy in the Department of Government at Cornell. I interviewed him about his new book, American Power after the Financial Crisis. HF: Some people argue that international institutions dealt quite successfully with the crisis. You evidently disagree. What do you see as the fundamental problems that manifested in the crisis, and why have they not been addressed? JK: First, let me ask: What institutions? The IMF did not see the crisis coming, favored the ideas and policies that made the crisis more likely, and was not a key player in containing it. The G20 and the Financial Stability Board? I don\\'t see the crucial role they performed. It was probably a good thing that the WTO existed — its presence was probably one of the many reasons we saw much less selfdefeating protectionism during this crisis then we did during the Great Depression. But that about it. The only \"institution\" that really mattered in dealing with the crisis was the U.S. Federal Reserve System, which not only flooded the American economy with liquidity, but also provided emergency currency swaps to European partners. But this latter contribution, although crucial, was an adhoc improvisation by the agency of a great power, not the functioning of international institutions. As for the core problem: the crisis was caused by toolarge, toointerconnected financial institutions engaging in reckless behavior that generated \"systemic risk.\" Systemic risk is a crucial part of this story, because even if individual actors are engaging in behaviors that are not reckless (which was not the case here), in finance, individually rational behaviors can produce extremely dangerous risks to the system as a whole. Finance is different, and requires public oversight, regulation, and supervision to a much greater extent than any other sector of the economy. But, in the United States at least, Washington and Wall Street, buttressed by academic economists, fell in love with ideologies such as the \"efficient market hypothesis\" which suggested that unfettered financial markets would lead to optimal outcomes and could best govern themselves. This is wrong. And these fundamental problems have not been addressed. The American economy is still characterized by a financial system that is too large, too concentrated, too interconnected, and dysfunctionally regulated. These problems persist because of the enormous political power of the financial services sector. Additionally, because adequate public policy stopped the financial crisis from causing a second Great Depression, opponents of fundamental reform were able to argue that real changes to the financial system were not necessary. HF: Your argument suggests that the global economic order that the United States made rests on monetary hegemony, ideological homogeneity, and shared security concerns and that all three are being eroded. Are the twin threats of Putin Russia and a more assertive China helping to some extent to bring U.S. allies back on board, or are they secondary to the forces that you identify? JK: These behaviors matter, but yes, at the moment, they are secondary. The foundations of any economic order — especially with regard to international money and finance, areas where cooperation is especially difficult to establish and maintain — rest on the distribution of power, common ideological commitments and beliefs about how to best organize international economic affairs, and shared, salient security concerns. This latter factor can be crucial, because if countries agree that they face a common, serious, security threat — such as the Soviet threat to western Europe during the cold war — they can be motivated to overcome even bitter disagreements over economic policies. So to the extent that Russia or China look more threatening, economic cooperation between the United States and those countries who view themselves as urgently dependent on an American security guarantee becomes more likely. Will this hold together a U.S.led international economic order? My view is that what I call the \"second postwar American economic order,\" which was forged in the early 1990s, came to an end with the Global Financial Crisis, and what we are seeing now is the emergence of a less coherent, more heterogeneous, more contested international economic order. HF: You suggest that the United States is in for a tough time, as it is forced to recognize international economic constraints on its domestic policy for many decades. Why has the United States gotten away with internationalizing its problems for so long, and what has changed now? JK: The extraordinarily exceptional position of the United States in the world economy rested on a number of factors, including the overwhelming dominance of the American economy, its role as the world \"safe heaven\" (the idea that although financial crises happened all over the world, the Unite States was invulnerable to them), and a shared belief that its economic ideology (especially as pertaining to unfettered finance) was correct, and one to which all countries aspired. These factors have all now changed. The U.S. economy remains enormous, robust, powerful, and essential — this cannot be emphasized enough — but as a general trend, it dominates the international economy somewhat less now than it did in the past, and most plausible scenarios suggest that this general trend will continue. Also, it is now clear that the U.S. economy is not exceptionally exempt from debilitating financial crises, and many countries and other actors now view its financial model with greater wariness. Thus, although the U.S. economy will likely remain more privileged than any other, it will nevertheless look more and more like a \"normal\" economy — that is, one that is subject to external pressures generated by the international economy, and less able to easily force burdens of economic adjustment abroad. HF: You see the seeds of a new order as having been sown in the Asian financial crisis. How are the disagreements that started to emerge back then shaping international economic politics today? JK: The United States, and its ally, the International Monetary Fund (which failed to see the Asian Financial Crisis coming and whose subsequent prescriptions made a bad situation worse), attributed that crisis to poor public policy (and \"crony capitalism\") within the affected Asian economies; many if not most actors in Asia (and elsewhere) recognized the crisis for what it was — a standard, garden variety international financial crisis — common throughout history, especially during periods of capital deregulation. (Both China and Japan, for example, interpreted the crisis in that way.) There was also, throughout East Asia, bitter resentment at the way the United States and the IMF exploited the crisis to extract concessions from vulnerable economies in exchange for emergency assistance. But this resentment was muttered through gritted teeth — in the late 1990s, there was little alternative to American power: American hegemony at that time was simply unprecedented and irresistible. There was also, then, a grudging sense that there was no alternative to the American model of ungoverned, uninhibited finance. The Global Financial Crisis matters, therefore, because for most of the world (not just Asia, but in Latin America and elsewhere), it was the second crisis of unregulated capital within ten . Outside the United States, therefore, the wheels of resistance to unfettered finance had been greased by the memory of recent upheavals . Moreover, the fact that the U.S. financial system stood at the epicenter of the crisis fundamentally delegitimized the idea that the U.S. financial model was singularly correct and the one towards which all economies must converge. HF: You suggest provocatively that the euro, despite its current problems, may well emerge as a major competitor to the dollar. How might this happen, and do the internal politics of the European Union seem likely to lead to it in the foreseeable future? JK: Again, to be very clear (and similar to my expectations regarding the U.S. economy more generally), my expectations are for the relative diminution of the international role of the dollar — not its eclipse. That is, even as someone considered a \"dollar pessimist,\" I nevertheless see the dollar remaining predominant, and eventually settling into a role that can be described as \"first among equals\" status among a number of international currencies. (My argument is that even such relative diminution will have political consequences and affect American power.) So my expectation is that the euro will come to serve as one of those currencies. I think it is obvious that the Global Financial Crisis revealed that the limitations of the Euro as constituted were even greater, and more profound, than most people thought — although the basic structural flaws and contradictions of the euro were long and well understood. And, from an outsider perspective, the internal politics of the European Union simply do not seem up to the task of solving these profound problems. But the current system seems unsustainable, and in the longer run, the euro system will need to either move forward (becoming more capacious) or take a step back (devolving to a smaller group of core members). In either case the euro will, eventually, likely play a role as an  international currency. But that is not to say that the euro problems have not helped sustain the reach of the dollar international role. Let me put it this way: the extraordinary extent of dollar international dominance used to rest on four pillars: the hegemony of the American economy, a belief in its invulnerability to financial crisis, the fact that all the world major monetary players were political allies and military dependencies of the United States, and the lack of plausible alternatives. Three of those pillars have been shaken — the lack of alternatives is the only one left standing. And many  players in the world are now keen to find such alternatives, and prefer that the global economy not be so overwhelmingly dollarcentric. These preferences will matter.

       " 'EU risks China solar power row flareup 8 January 2015 Agence France Presse The EU risked reopening a bitter feud with China over solar panel manufacturing after confirming Thursday it had launched a fresh trade probe into a key part of the sector. Confirming media reports, European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario  EU trade authorities opened an investigation last month into alleged price dumping by China on solar glass, a key component of solar panels. A 2013 trade row over solar panels sparked the EU biggestever trade probe covering a market worth some 21 billion euros ($25 billion) at its zenith. But last July, Brussels and China came to a hardwon agreement, ending heated rounds of titfortat measures that included a Chinese probe into European wine imports. Estimated at about 210 million euros, solar glass manufacturing is just a small component of the panel market in Europe. Launched on December 19, the EU has nine months to gather information on the solar glass case and decide whether to move forward with an official complaint. Rosario insisted the probe was unrelated and much narrower than the now resolved feud over solar panels. \"This is a standalone investigation concerning a clearly distinct product and analysing imports during a different period,\" Rosario told AFP. But EU manufacturers argue illegally low pricing by China of solar glass is killing European jobs. \"The prices are absurdly low,\"  Ulrich Frei, president of the EU ProSun lobby group that spearheaded the original campaign against the Chinese solar panel industry. \"The prices are under the manufacturing costs, even when (import) duties are included,\" he added. EU ProSun has been a fierce critic of Chinese manufacturers which it says have put Europe solar panel industry in the shade by dumping their products below cost on the European market.',\n",

In a filing on Thursday, Imperial asked the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to review suspension agreements hammered out last month aimed at ending a spat that has roiled trade between the two countries, cut off crucial raw sugar supplies from Mexico, and elevated tensions between those countries for almost a . Fellow refiner AmCane Sugar LLC has joined the review, according to the company lawyer, who confirmed that the group filed its own \"official challenge.\" In March, the U.S. sugar industry accused Mexico of dumping cheap subsidized sugar in the heavily protected U.S. market. The recent deal that set quotas and minimum sales prices rather than impose heavy antidumping and other penalties for Mexican imports into the United States, does not go far enough to prevent injury to the U.S. refiners, Imperial counsel  in the Jan. 8 document filed to the U.S. Department of Commerce. \"The stakes are high\" for Imperial Sugar, other cane refiners, and their customers, the company letter . \"If these agreements enter into force, domestic production of cane sugar and related jobs would be at risk.\" A spokeswoman for Louis Dreyfus could not immediately be reached for comment because of the late hour in Geneva. The requests for review could prolong the sugar dispute that has roiled prices and trade flows between the two countries for nearly a . Imperial Sugar and other cane refiners worry that the socalled suspension agreements would curb imports of raw sugar to feed their plants. At the same time, they face greater competition from bumper refined sugar output, which Mexican mills sell direct to food manufacturers and other sugar processors. Under NAFTA, Mexico has had unfettered access to the coveted U.S. sugar market in 2008. \"Not only do the suspension agreements not eliminate the injury, they actually augment that injury to cane refiners,\" John Magnus, AmCane counsel, told Reuters in a phone interview. ITC is reviewing the requests and determining next steps, as this is the first time the review statute has been invoked since being written into law in 1979,  an agency spokeswoman.

       " 'India considering higher subsidies for raw sugar exports By Mayank Bhardwaj NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) India cabinet could soon approve an increase in the raw sugar subsidy paid to mills to about 4,000 rupees ($64) per tonne as it looks to cut large stockpiles, two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. India, the world biggest producer behind Brazil, paid a subsidy of 3,300 rupees to produce and export raw sugar in the season that ended in September. The subsidy proposal will soon go for approval to Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet, the sources . The country is sitting on massive mounds of the sweetener due to the fifth straight  of surplus output, which has depressed local prices and strained mills\\' finances. Additionally India, which is also the world biggest sugar consumer, has failed to export because of weak global prices. New York raw sugar futures, the global benchmark, are trading near a more than four  low hit in the third quarter of 2014. With the help of the incentives, mills say they will be able to sell raw sugar to standalone refineries in Asia and Africa. \"Looking at the current global trade dynamics, merely extending last  export subsidy will not be of any help,\"  one of the sources. Export incentives and rising global prices may finally help India sugar mills clinch export deals in the 2014/15 season. New York sugar futures are up slightly so far this , after four consecutive  of falls. Reversing weeks of losses, India sugar prices gained 2.5 percent to $461 a tonne in the week to Thursday. India sugar mills produced 7.5 million tonnes of the sweetener between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, more than a quarter higher than a  earlier, as crushing in the biggest cane producing state of Uttar Pradesh started a week in advance, a producers\\' body  on Monday.

       " 'Few casualties after rare earths trade war peters out By Alan BeattIe in London 9 January 2015 Financial Times This week, a trade war that was supposed to tear the world of hightech manufacturing apart ended peacefully, quietly and with few casualties. China announced plans that would comply with a World Trade Organisation decision from last  by removing export quotas and other restrictions on rare earth elements, the minerals used widely in the manufacture of electronics, computers and cars. It was another success for the US, which has not only chalked up impressive wins against China in the WTO dispute settlement process but also (by no means a given) often succeeded in getting Beijing to implement the decisions. So, a big victory for global governance? Sort of. In reality, it was the free market as much as trade rules that did for China attempt to corner global commerce in rare earths. Moreover, in a rather choice irony, Chinese companies employed the very tricks that they use to sidestep trade restrictions by other governments to sabotage the export quotas set by their own. By 2010, China produced 97 per cent of the world basic rare earth oxide production and much of the processing business. In its submission to the WTO, Beijing laughably argued that a complex system of export restrictions it had placed on its rare earth companies since the mid2000s was aimed at protecting the environment by controlling mining. In reality, as the WTO dispute panel swiftly twigged, it was an attempt to give its domestic electronics and other manufacturing industries a competitive advantage by ensuring a cheap captive supply of raw materials. This is a familiar pattern among commodityproducing emerging markets trying to develop their own manufacturing industry. When first Ukraine and then Russia joined the WTO in 2008 and 2012 respectively, for example, the EU insisted they make binding pledges not to restrict raw material exports, particularly metals. China policy seemed to have some success. The rocketing price of the minerals in the late 2000s disadvantaged users across the world. As Eugene Gholz at the University of Texas says, some Japanese manufacturers that use rare earths as an input did relocate to China to take advantage of cheap and reliable supply. And just to provide the nonspecialist media with a nice story, in 2010 China reportedly used the threat of more export restrictions to force Japan into returning a Chinese fishingboat captain it had arrested sailing worryingly close to disputed islands in the South China Sea. Accordingly, the statecapitalismherewecome crowd concluded that the Chinese were, once again, proving themselves strategic geniuses. But, to adapt a saying in the oil markets, the best cure for high rare earth prices is high rare earth prices. Production in Australia, Japan and Malaysia was expanded; other sources of rare earths were exploited; manufacturers rapidly found ways to economise or substitute, as it were, a less rare rare earth for a rarer one. Happily, the US government, rather than resort to retaliatory trade restrictions of its own, found a way to help this process along by funding research into diversification. The global price of the minerals fell and economic Armageddon was avoided.',\n",

The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) complained that imports of calcium hypochlorite from China are subsidized and sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the commission affirmative determinations, the U.S. Commerce Department will issue antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of this product from China. The antidumping duty rate is 210.52 percent and the countervailing duty rate is 65.85 percent, according to the department final determination in December 2014. The Commerce Department launched the antidumping and countervailing duties probes over Chinese calcium hypochlorite products in January 2014 at the request of Arch Chemicals based in the U.S. state of Georgia. Calcium hypochlorite is often used in the chlorination of water in residential and commercial swimming pools. Imports of these products from China were estimated at 8.1 million U.S. dollars in 2013, according to U.S. official data. Beijing has repeatedly urged Washington to abide by its commitment against protectionism and work with China to maintain a free, open and just trade environment.',\n",

Vietnam Jan. 7 appeal  the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) failed to make an objective assessment in its analysis of U.S. law regarding the Department of Commerce implementation of adverse WTO rulings. Specifically, Vietnam contested the panel conclusion that it had failed to argue that Section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act precludes implementation of DSB recommendations by the U.S. with respect to prior unliquidated entries. Typically, the WTO Appellate Body has 90 days to issue a subsequent report following an appeal from the DSB. U.S. ‘Zeroing’ Methodology Vietnam had previously challenged Commerce application of “zeroing” methodologies in its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order regarding Vietnamese shrimp. On Nov. 17, 2014, the DSB  such methods violated U.S. obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the AntiDumping Agreement. The WTO panel found that Commerce had used “zeroing” methods to calculate the dumping margins of individually examined Vietnamese producers and exporters in three antidumping administrative reviews. The case echoes a 2011 WTO decision that ruled against Commerce use of zeroing in earlier administrative reviews. U.S. trade officials did not immediately comment.',\n",

       " 'Merkel sets high bar for lifting of Russia sanctions * German leader says progress on Minsk not enough * Merkel praises Kiev for \"ambitious\" reform plans By Andreas Rinke BERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) German Chancellor Angela Merkel  on Thursday that Europe could not consider lifting sanctions against Russia until all elements of a 12point peace agreement signed in September between Ukraine and proRussian rebels were fully implemented. In her clearest comments yet on the sanctions issue, the German leader adopted a more hawkish stance than that set out by senior politicians from her coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), and European leaders like French President Francois Hollande in recent days. Worried about a deterioration of the Russian economy, they have suggested that progress on the socalled Minsk protocol agreed in September, rather than full implementation, would be sufficient to consider easing the sanctions. Speaking at a news conference in Berlin with visiting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, Merkel  she had \"little hope\" that a first round of sanctions introduced in response to Russia annexation of Crimea could be lifted. And she placed a high bar for easing a second round of punitive EU measures tied to Russia intervention in eastern Ukraine. Moscow denies backing the separatist rebels in the conflict, which has killed more than 4,700 people, despite what Ukraine and Western governments say is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. \"The entire Minsk agreement must be implemented before we can say these sanctions can be lifted,\" she , specifically ruling out a stepbystep easing based on progress on the 12 points, which include a ceasefire, monitoring of the UkraineRussia border, security zones and the release of hostages. Top SPD politicians have sounded a more dovish note in recent weeks, with Foreign Minister FrankWalter Steinmeier expressing concern that Russia could be destabilised if EU sanctions were not eased. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, senior SPD lawmaker Gernot Erler, the government coordinator for relations with Russia,  Berlin should think about easing sanctions \"if we see progress on the 12 points of the Minsk accord\". France Hollande told French radio on Monday: \"I think the sanctions must stop now. They must be lifted if there is progress.\" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini  on Wednesday there were \"some limited\" signs that Russia may be changing its approach. But Merkel made clear that a meeting of leaders from Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany, which had been planned for midJanuary in the Kazakh capital of Astana, would only take place if there was progress on the peace front in the coming days. She also praised Yatseniuk for his government reform programme, including the austerity budget pushed through in late December. The budget was a condition for the disbursement of cash under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid package that totals $17 billion. \"The prime minister gave a very impressive report on the reforms planned in Ukraine,\" Merkel . \"It is ambitious, it is determined. And I believe it was a huge success to finalise a budget before Christmas that was anything but easy and that includes a number of new measures.\" (Additional reporting by Alexandra Hudson and Erik Kirschbaum; Writing by Noah Barkin; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)',\n",

Total government and enterprise spending in information technology goods and services on the mainland is estimated to reach 807 billion yuan (HK$1.02 trillion), up 8 per cent from last , according to the latest industry forecast published yesterday by Forrester Research. That prediction puts the mainland strongly entrenched as the world’s thirdlargest information technology market, behind the United States and Japan. The report, which excluded consumer and corporate telecommunications services spending, projected the US market to reach US$862.8 billion this , followed by Japan at 19.9 trillion yen (HK$1.3 trillion). India’s enterprise technology market is expected be worth 1.97 billion rupees (HK$240.3 million) this , advancing 9.1 per cent from last .

It calculated this market to be worth US$465.6 billion this , an 11.4 per cent increase over last .

       " 'US export economy fails to import jobs Gillian Tett Financial Times January 8, 2015 6:10 pm American businesses are now so efficient they require fewer workers This month, brace yourself to hear plenty of rhetoric coming out of Washington about “exports” and “jobs”. As a new Republicandominated Congress starts work, energy companies are lobbying to drop a decadesold ban on exports of crude oil, arguing that such sales will create thousands of American jobs. As pitches go, it is a powerful one. But there is another question about exports and jobs that Congress should be debating more urgently: the fact that US businesses are becoming so efficient that they require fewer workers than ever before to deliver growth, even — or especially — for exports. Take a look at some fascinating data compiled by the Commerce Department, and quietly released last . This shows that in the past few , the number of American jobs supported by exports has risen as overseas sales have grown. In 2009, exports created 9.7m jobs; by 2013 the tally was 11.3m. This is cheering. And since overseas sales rose further in 2014, amid a wider economic recovery, there is every reason to think that when the commerce department publishes the 2014 tally the number of exportlinked jobs will have grown again. But there is a billion dollar catch. Look at how many jobs are being generated per dollar of sales and the graph steadily slopes down. Back in 2009, each billion dollar’s worth of exports was creating 6,763 jobs. In 2013, it was 5,590 jobs. That is a fall of 17 per cent — in just four . There are two ways to interpret this trend. If members of Congress want to feel cheery at the start of a new , they could celebrate the fact that American companies are becoming more innovative and competitive on the world stage. This partly reflects lower energy costs. But another factor is that as recovery has taken hold in the US, levels of automation and digitisation are rising sharply too. That is prompting more US companies to develop production inside America, since it holds down labour costs. While Chinese workers might be cheaper than their American counterparts, robots are more cost effective than both — and often more competent. Take Alcoa, the world’s thirdlargest aluminium company. Having previously expanded production in places such as Mexico and Asia, it is now focusing heavily on the US. This winter, for example, it is remodelling a plant in Savannah, Georgia, that uses pioneering processes to forge metal to withstand ultrahigh temperatures. A decade ago, such work might have been placed outside America. But Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa chief executive, says that it now makes sense to keep it in Savannah, to be closer to customers and research units. “The pressure to automate is huge,” he says. “We are not doing it for cost, but for innovation reasons\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009a precision is required that no human hand or eye can deliver.” Companies such as Whirlpool, General Electric and Ford are taking similar steps. Even clothing companies are doing the same. Levi Strauss, for example, still makes its jeans outside America. But it recently brought its innovation centre — and those jobs — from Turkey to San Francisco. Boston Consulting Group reckons that over half of all large US manufacturing companies are either actively reshoring activity, or considering this, as America becomes a more competitive destination. There is a more pessimistic twist to all this: what will the surplus workers do? An optimistic answer is that the economy will eventually adapt to generate new jobs, as it did 150  ago when farm workers were forced off the land. A downbeat scenario is that this trend will exacerbate the bifurcation that has developed in the jobs market in the past decade, as midtier manufacturing jobs have disappeared. In a world of hyperefficient companies there is swelling demand for a highly trained elite; indeed, Thursday’s jobless claims data suggest that companies are actually finding it hard to hire enough skilled workers. Alcoa needs plenty of computer programmers. But what it does not need (as much) are traditional metalbashers. Exports can boom — but with fewer bluecollar workers. Mr Kleinfeld has recently started working with community colleges on retraining programmes, in a bid to help workers to adapt. Other companies are doing the same. But what is lamentably missing is any coherent policy from Washington to support such endeavour. Indeed, Congress seems to be paying woefully little attention to the issue, compared with the focus it is devoting to other topics, such as those energy exports. That needs to change — well before the current recovery loses steam. LEADER',\n",
       " 'Obama must grasp the chance for deals on trade; New Congress offers narrow window to push Pacific and Europe pacts 9 January 2015 Financial Times A  ago President Barack Obama called on the US Congress to give him fast track authority to negotiate big trade deals in the Pacific and Atlantic. Harry Reid, then Senate majority leader, scuttled Mr Obama request saying it would be unwise to agree to it in an election . Mr Reid caution was scant help to his fellow Democrats who went on to lose the Senate in last November midterm elections. This week, Republicans took formal control of both chambers of Congress. Working with them to enact Trade Promotion Authority is Mr Obama only real hope of securing his ambitious trade agenda. Doing so would help America economic resurgence and cement Mr Obama legacy . He should push for TPA passage at the earliest opportunity. The political logic for acting now is compelling. Unlike the Democrats, who are deeply riven over trade even more so than 20  ago, when only a minority voted for Bill Clinton North American Free Trade Agreement. The Republicans remain an instinctively protrade party. There is a loud group of dissenters within the Tea Party caucus, which would be loath to give the White House executive discretion, particularly since Mr Obama issued a stay on the deportation of illegal immigrants late last . But they are a minority. Moreover, some hardline conservatives, such as Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, would almost certainly be in favour of the two trade deals. In other words, trade is a rare issue on which Mr Obama and most Republicans agree. The president must exploit that opportunity as quickly as he can. The economic timing is auspicious. US growth is picking up speed. Indeed, 2015 could be the first  since the Great Recession when the US economy breaks through the 3 per cent growth barrier. Growth oils the wheels of politics, which ought to make it easier for Mr Obama to make the case to the US public. Last month, the US trade deficit dropped to its lowest level in a . That should also help America to discharge its responsibility to take measures to boost growth in the rest of the world, most of which is slowing just as the US is picking up. Growth in Japan, which is America biggest interlocutor in the 13nation Transpacific Partnership, and in the European Union, which is the other half of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is close to stalling. By embracing TPA, Mr Obama could embolden counterparts in Asia and Europe to sell the necessary compromises to their electorates. Finally, the geopolitical moment is ripe. Concluding the TPP would be an integral part of Mr Obama \"pivot to Asia\". The deal would encompass roughly 40 per cent of the world economy. China is not a part of it. But TTP conclusion would give Beijing a strong incentive to work with its neighbours to meet their standards. The same applies to TTIP, whose advocates in Brussels and Washington see as a potential gold standard for trade and investment. It is hard to imagine that Mr Obama could pull off either deal unless he first secured leeway from Congress. Michael Froman, Mr Obama able trade representative, believes he could conclude a TPP deal first and then persuade Congress to enact fasttrack authority. If so, then good luck to him. But it would reverse the sequence on all previous big trade deals, including Nafta. More likely is that Mr Obama will first have to cobble together a majority of Republicans and a sufficient minority of Democrats to pass TPA. That could take months. It would also be rancorous. There is no time to lose.',\n",
       " 'Why is China acting like a responsible stakeholder? By Daniel W. Drezner 9 January 2015 Washington Post.com Earlier this week China announced that, on rare earth exports, it would now play by the rules of the global game. The Wall Street Journal ChuinWei Yap explains: China has dropped decadeold quotas limiting exports of strategically  minerals that sparked an global trade dispute and led some countries to reduce their reliance on Chinese supplies…. Now the excerpted portion of the WSJ story seems like pretty strong evidence for the argument I made in \"The System Worked.\" Contrary to conventional wisdom, China has acted like a responsible supporter of the rules of the global economic game and not like a revisionist bound and determined to undercut the U.S.created system. Changing its domestic rules to comply with its international obligations is an example of China coordinating its policies to maintain greater economic openness. Chalk up a victory for global economic governance, and walk away. Of course, neither life nor the global political economy are really that simple. As Ed Crooks cogently explains in the Financial Times, there another reason China is cooperating: China is unlikely to retain control of the global market for rare earths, because users have become more efficient in their consumption and found alternative sources, according to a former adviser at the US Department of Defense. You can read Gholz CFR paper here (full disclosure: I refereed this paper for CFR). The story Gholz tells is a combination of market and policy responses — but mostly the former. In essence, however, three major factors kicked in as the market response to China 2010 informal rare earth embargo: * Mines based in other countries naturally ramped up production, particularly for the more abundant \"lighter\" rare earths. * In response to higher prices, Developed country producers in Japan, Europe and the US got much better at reducing, reusing, and recycling rare earths. Which means that demand started to slacken. * Private Chinese producers, tempted by the higher post2010 prices, busted the government embargo. So, in other words, China 2010 rare earth gambit resulted in an adverse WTO judgment and a market response that caused prices to fall and badly eroded China market dominance of rare earths. China acquiescing to the WTO judgment suddenly seems like less of a concession. This ties into a point I made last  — the most powerful kinds of economic statecraft are the kinds where market forces and policy responses work in tandem. That has happened in the case of Russian economic sanctions, for example — and they\\'re happening now for rare earths. This is still a case of the system working — China could choose to react like Russia, but it has chosen a more neoliberalfriendly path. But the rare earths case also demonstrates that the reason for the system resiliency is not only due to global governance structures, or great power policy responses. The system resiliency is hardwired into the inherently marketfriendly nature of the open global economy. China has observed what happens to countries *COUGH* Russia *COUGH* Venezuela *COUGH* that try to defy that system when their primary export commodity price crashes. Beijing is willing to subsidize some of these countries to advance its own national interest. When it comes to the global economy, however, China values the benefits it receives from the system a heck of a lot more than they resent it. Which is why China continues to be a responsible stakeholder. Am I missing anything? END ________________________________',\n",

The worlds largest economy created 252,000 jobs last month, better than the 240,000 extra jobs that economists had predicted. Total US job creation for 2014 hit 2.95m, the Labor Department figures showed. The strong job growth data reinforce the growing evidence that the US is powering ahead of other large economies and is likely to increase the gap in growth rates in the first half of this . The outlook for the US economy contrasts sharply with that of the eurozone, which has plunged into deflation for the first time in more than five . While investors are betting that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this summer, expectations are also growing for the European Central Bank to embark on a fullblown programme of bondbuying to stimulate its economy. Fridays figures also showed a better than expected fall in the US unemployment rate in December, from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent, ahead of predictions of 5.7 per cent. Economists have warned that as unemployment continues to fall to the rate the Fed considers normal between 5.2 per cent and 5.5 per cent pressure will build for interest rates to rise sooner rather than later. The steady pace of US job creation and the falling unemployment rate have sharpened the pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates for the first time since the recession. In December, chairwoman Janet Yellen signalled that the central bank could lift its overnight lending rate as early as April. However, the low level of inflation, which remains below the Feds target of 2 per cent, is still an area of concern. Wage growth another worry for the Fed also disappointed in December, with average hourly earnings dropping 0.2 per cent from November to increase just 1.7 per cent over the previous 12 months. Treasuries rallied following the report, with yields on the 10 note, which move inversely to its price, falling 7 basis points to 1.945 per cent. US labour secretary Thomas Perez hailed the jobs figures as very solid, but  that more still needed to be done to boost wage growth. The challenge is undeniably the unfinished business of this recovery, which is to ensure the prosperity we see is shared prosperity and the contributions that workers make to productivity result in real wage growth, he .',\n",
       " \"European Parliament Draft Opinion Seeks Privacy Exemption From EUU.S. Trade Pact By Stephen Gardner, Bloomberg BNA Jan. 8 The proposed European UnionU.S. Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership should contain a comprehensive and unambiguous exemption for European Union data protection rules, according to a draft European Parliament opinion drawn up by the Parliament lead data protection negotiator, Jan Philipp Albrecht. According to the Jan. 6 opinion, which Albrecht prepared for the European Parliament Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee (LIBE), TTIP should guarantee full respect for EU fundamental rights standards, and shouldn't undermine EU safeguards on transfers of personal data outside the bloc. In addition, TTIP could be used as a means to protect EU citizens from mass electronic surveillance, according to the opinion. Data protection authorities and many lawmakers in the EU are concerned about the scope of data collection activities by the U.S. National Security Agency. The consent of the European Parliament to the final TTIP agreement could be endangered as long as the blanket mass surveillance activities are not completely abandoned, the draft text . Albrecht is a German Green lawmaker who is the European Parliament lead negotiator on the EU data protection reform effort. Albrecht draft opinion, will, if approved by LIBE, be forwarded to the European Parliament International Trade Committee, which is preparing an overarching European Parliament resolution on TTIP. Neither the LIBE opinion nor the final resolution would be binding. The European Parliament didn't set a deadline for submission of amendments to Albrecht draft text, or set a date for when the proposed LIBE opinion will be debated. Negotiation Transparency Concerns The European Parliament resolution on TTIP is being prepared amid the concerns of some lawmakers and advocacy groups that the EUU.S. TTIP talks lack transparency. Albrecht draft opinion  that, in particular, a draft TTIP chapter on electronic commerce hasn't been made available to members of the European Parliament. The TTIP talks, which are aimed at coordinating EU and U.S. regulation in several areas, started in July 2013. The EU Ombudsman, who investigates allegations of mismanagement by EU institutions, published a decision Jan. 6 that  the European Commission, which is negotiating for the EU side, should more openly provide information about TTIP. The commission Jan. 7 published draft negotiating texts drawn up by EU negotiators and several fact sheets on TTIP chapters. These make little reference to data protection, apart from a statement in one fact sheet on services that data protection standards won't be part of TTIP negotiations. TTIP will make sure that the EU data protection laws prevail over any commitments. A European Parliament official who asked not to be named told Bloomberg BNA Jan. 8 that this statement hasn't assuaged lawmakers' concerns. The commission has only revealed commission proposals, and there was concern that as the negotiations progress, U.S. proposals, especially in the ecommerce chapter, which hasn't been published, could undermine our data protection, the official .\",\n",

Some 245 of the select respondents responded to the survey. According to the survey, 83 percent of the chamber business leaders strongly support the Taiwanese government hope of joining the proposed trade agreement, as this will enhance Taiwan growth prospects and help it avoid economic marginalization. They added that Taiwan will be able to meet the pact high standards. Taiwan President Ma Yingjeou has spoken about the vital importance of engaging in thorough economic reform to prepare the country for participation in TPP. To avoid being isolated from regional economic integration, Ma administration set a goal to join the TPP by 2020. According to AmCham Taipei, during the past , the business chamber has been encouraged by indications that the Taiwanese government has been reviewing the regulatory process with an eye to bringing Taiwan procedures in line with standard international practices. The pace will need to be accelerated to enhance Taiwan chances for eventual inclusion in the TransPacific Partnership.

Taiwan Will Meet TPP Standards The survey also found that 68 percent of respondents believe Taiwan is capable of meeting the high standards required for the TPP membership. In the survey, respondents  they believe that, for Taiwan to sign free trade agreements with other economies, it must increase its ability to attract foreign investment and boost trade by liberalizing its market and implementing international standards. A majority of respondents also  Taiwan and the U.S. should negotiate a bilateral investment agreement. The result shows that 66 percent of respondents see the lack of a U.S.Taiwan bilateral investment agreement as a disadvantage for Taiwan; among them, 20 percent view it as a major disadvantage. Seventy percent of the executives surveyed  their companies were profitable in 2014, adding that they can maintain similar profit levels in 2015. We hope that we may look forward to the vigorous adoption of economic reform initiatives in the coming , including implementation of the Free Economic Pilot Zone plan, to further strengthen Taiwan future economic outlook, Fann wrote.',\n",

       " \"Some House Democrats, Various Groups Denounce Plans for FastTrack Legislation By Len Bracken, Bloomberg BNA Jan. 8 A coalition of some House Democrats, labor groups and nongovernmental organizations Jan. 8 voiced their opposition to congressional proposals to approve trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation that has been cited by senior Republican lawmakers and the White House as an area of possible cooperation. In a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill, coalition members  past trade agreements have been disastrous for U.S. workers and expressed their strong doubts as to the benefits of the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) being negotiated by the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. Some members of the coalition called into question the constitutionality of any fasttrack legislation that would limit debate on trade agreements and deny opportunities to amend trade deals submitted to Congress by the administration for approval. The coalition, which was led at the event by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (DConn.) and AFLCIO President Richard Trumka, included lawmakers and a wide spectrum of organizations. The AFLCIO doesn't just oppose fast track, we're going to fight actively to kill it, Trumka . DeLauro described the coalition as one of the broadest she has seen in her 24  in Congress, including environmental and health care advocacy groups, community and consumer protection organizations, and unions. Seventeen House Democrats In addition to DeLauro, 16 Democratic House members spoke at the event. Louise Slaughter (N.Y.) spoke first, followed by Peter DeFazio (Ore.), Mark Pocan (Wisc.), Barbara Lee (Calif.), Keith Ellison (Minn.), Marcy Kaptur (Ohio), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Alan Grayson (Fl.), Donna Edwards (Md.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), Dan Kildee (Minn.), Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), Janice Hahn (Calif.), Debbie Dingle (Mich.), Mark DeSaulnier (Calif.) and Paul Tonko (N.Y.). DeFazio noted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (RKy.) Jan. 7  he was in favor of renewing the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), referring to the program primarily administered by the Labor Department that is designed to offer assistance and training for workers displaced by international trade. DeFazio questioned whether the training would be for work at McDonalds and pledged not to serve as a doormat for multinational corporations that he  were the primary beneficiaries of U.S. trade agreements. Dingle, who traveled with President Barack Obama to Michigan Jan. 7, praised the president for the assistance provided by the administration to the auto industry in her state, but she  passage of trade promotion authority legislation would represent a setback for companies such as Ford that are currently successful. She raised the issue of Japanese currency devaluations, describing currency manipulation as the mother of all trade barriers and providing an unfair advantage to Japanese automakers, specifically citing Toyota as a beneficiary. While the TPA legislation introduced in the 113th Congress included currencyrelated provisions among a long list of negotiating objectives, critics note these provisions were nonbinding. U.S. trade officials  in late 2013 that currency was not a subject of the TPP negotiations up to that stage in the talks. The Big Three U.S. automakersChrysler, Ford and General Motorshave  through the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) that they will not support TPP unless it includes meaningful provisions against currency manipulation. White House Pledges Not to Sign Bad Deal When asked about Democratic opposition to the administration trade agenda, administration spokesman Josh Earnest  Jan. 7 to the press aboard Air Force One en route to Detroit that the president will not agree to a trade pact that is not in the best interest of the U.S. As the President seeks to open up additional markets overseas to American businesses, we're going to use the same guiding principle, and we're going to make sure that whatever trade agreement that the President is able to reach is in the best interests of the American auto industry and in the best interests of American businesses, Earnest . And here the thing: If presented with an agreement that doesn't do that, then we won't have a deal and the President won't agree to it. When asked to respond to this assertion, DeLauro questioned the transparency of the processwhereas members of Congress can see draft negotiating texts, their staff cannot, nor can notes be taken in the highly secure, designated reading room. She contrasted that with health care legislation that could be scrutinized on a linebyline basis before the deal was consummated. We are the duly elected people in 435 congressional districts, she . We have to represent their interests and that is what we are trying to do.

Charles Boustany and Robert B. Zoellick (Dec. 29) and wondered what economic data they are viewing. Recently the Economic Policy Institute published a study about the effect our massive trade deficit has on manufacturing jobs. This trade deficit with China will be in excess of $320 billion for 2014. When Mr. Zoellick started as U.S. Trade Representative in 2000, the trade deficit with China was about $83 billion. Great growth for China! The study concluded that the China trade deficit has cost the U.S. economy 3.2 million jobs. Of those jobs, 2.4 million were manufacturing jobs. With this massive trade deficit all common sense tells us that China is taking our jobs. We watched the median household income drop from $56,000 in 2000 to $52,000 in 2013. Can Rep. Boustany and Mr. Zoellick not connect the dots about massive trade deficits and lower income on Main Street? Let use the example of the most recent \"free trade\" agreement with South Korea. This agreement went into effect in 2011, and since 2011 U.S. exports to South Korea have gone nowhere while our trade deficit with South Korea has gone from $13 billion in 2010 to over $20 billion in 2013. Where are all the exports that the Obama administration promised the American people when they passed this free trade agreement? The TransPacific Partnership is the same snake oil that has been sold to the American public for the last 20  free trade deals will create great export jobs for our citizens. The countries in the TPP want to export to the U.S. market, not buy U.S. products. Bill Hickey, Chicago',\n",

German authorities detected the virus in a stork kept at Rostock Zoo in the northeastern state of MecklenburgWestern Pomerania. Local press reports also quote officials as confirming H5N8 in two hunterkilled mallard ducks in SaxonyAnhalt another northeastern state. The cases add to earlier German cases in November and December, when the same strain was also detected in the Netherlands, UK and Italy. Meanwhile, US authorities have confirmed further cases of both H5N8 and H5N2 avian flu the former in a hunter killed duck in the Pacific flyway reportedly in northcentral California. The USDA  tests pointed to an identical strain to that found in Washington state in midDecember. In a separate report to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE, the department  H5N2 avian flu had been found in a backyard poultry flock in Benton Country in southeastern Washington. Meanwhile, the state of Oregon continues to implement its multiagency response plan following last months discovery of H5N8 bird flu in a backyard bird flock in Douglas County. Trade bans in force So far, some 30 countries have imposed restrictions on imports of US poultry due to concerns over recent H5 bird flu outbreaks. In most cases, these measures are limited to affected states or regions. But in recent days, South Korea has banned imports of all unprocessed US poultry closing the door on trade worth more than $90 million in the first eleven months of 2014. Similar blanket bans have been imposed by Sri Lanka and Thailand although neither of these countries are major importers of US poultry. Meanwhile, the EU has banned the import of US poultrymeat from December 19 although impacts on trade are again minimal as EU sanitary requirements mean almost no US poultry is currently imported by the bloc. New rules also mean poultry products from Oregon and Washington state are no longer allowed to enter the EU even for onward shipment to third countries. USDA response In a recent statement, the USDA urged trading partners not to overreact to recent bird flu outbreaks, calling for any restrictions to be based on sound science and to be limited to affected regions. Unfortunately, some countries have decided to place far more restrictive measures than necessary on US poultry, including, in a few instances, bans on imports of all US poultry and poultry products, the department notes. We disagree with these actions and are taking a number of steps to address them and help support the US poultry industry. The statement notes that highly pathogenic avian flu has not been detected in commercial US poultry and vows to press trading partners to bring their import restrictions into line with OIE guidelines.',\n",

In a fact sheet issued by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the administration Jan. 9  it has provided detailed summaries of negotiation priorities on the TPP and the TTIP and information on key negotiation topics and press conferences following negotiating rounds. The USTR also outlined the extent of its consultations with Congress, citing more than 1,600 congressional briefings on the TPP and the granting of access for all members to current negotiating texts in a secure reading room on Capitol Hill. The agency fact sheet follows a Jan. 8 press conference by opponents of the administration trade policy where some members of Congress, along with public interest groups, charged the administration with conducting secret trade negotiations and called for increased transparency (6 DER A40, 1/9/15). Trade officials contend that negotiations are necessarily conducted on a confidential basis, so offers and counteroffers can be made discretely until negotiators arrive at final offers. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has  he is committed to providing as much transparency as possible consistent with simultaneously obtaining the best deal for the U.S. Transparency Provisions in TPA Bill The USTR fact sheet comes as trade has emerged as an issue of potential cooperation between the administration and the newly seated 114th Congress, notably around trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation that would provide for upordown votes on trade agreements. Bolstering the transparency provisions in the previous TPA was a stated goal of Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (DOre.). In a Jan. 9 briefing with reporters, National Foreign Trade Council President William Reinsch  any changes to the transparency provisions of the TPA bill introduced in the 113th Congress concerning the degree of information provided by the administration to Congress, to the public and to trade advisory committees and other stakeholders would likely be dealt with piecemeal. The advisory committee system was created by Congress in 1974 to ensure that U.S. trade policy and trade negotiating objectives reflect U.S. public and private sector interests.

Big C, for example, joined the Vietnamese market in 1998 when setting up a joint venture with a Vietnamese partner, while Metro Cash & Carry got a license to set up a 100 percent foreign owned enterprise in 2002. The limitations on the kinds of good foreigners can distribute in Vietnam have been applied since January 1, 2007. This means that the foreign distributors who came to Vietnam before that time did not have any limitations. Vietnam did not set any limitations regarding the sources of the products to be distributed in Vietnam. This means that foreign invested distribution chains can determine what products to be displayed in their chains, even if they are made in Vietnam or sourced from other countries. The Vietnamese logistics market has also become a playing field for foreign firms. A report from the Vietnam Shipowners Association showed there are only 25 operational foreign invested logistics firms in Vietnam, but they control 80 percent of the logistics market. Vietnam has joined the WTO, but the economy remains weak,  Dr. Le Dang Doanh, a renowned independent economist. This is attributed to the weak inner strength of the national economy. Vietnam has been too slow in carrying out economic reforms, he noted. What will happen? According to Truong Dinh Tuyen, former Minister of Trade, under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Vietnam bears pressure on goods trade because it had to cut import tariffs. Meanwhile, under the WTO, the major pressure is on the opening of the service market. Vietnam has committed to open a productionrelating service market from January 11, 2015, which analysts say will start a foreign outsourcing vs domestic outsourcing battle. Pham Chi Lan, a renowned economist, commented: Vietnam, before joining WTO, had advantages in doing footwear and garment outsourcing. After joining WTO, its advantages are still in footwear, garment outsourcing and making some electronic parts. However, outsourcing will be no longer be the privilege of Vietnamese industrial enterprises, once foreigninvested enterprises can also join the playing field. The enterprises will have advantages in obtaining outsourcing contracts as nominated by multinational conglomerates. Also from January 11, 2015, foreign investors will have full rights just like Vietnamese in hotel development and food & beverage catering. Analysts warn that if Vietnamese cannot well prepare for this eventuality, they will only get small pieces of the lucrative business field. (Viet Nam Net January 5)',\n",
       " 'How to Stop Currency Manipulation The Opinion Pages | OpEd Contributor By JARED BERNSTEIN JAN. 9, 2015 New York Times WASHINGTON IF the new Congress can agree on anything this , it may well be the TransPacific Partnership, a trade deal between the United States and 11 other countries throughout the AsiaPacific region. Passions run high when it comes to trade deals these days, and the Obama administration is working hard to sell it to labor unions, which roundly oppose it. So far the pitch has been about what the deal, as written, will do to help the American economy a pitch that hasnt won over many, on either side of the partisan divide. But theres one thing the administration can do that will both win over some opponents and address one of the biggest issues in global trade: add a chapter on currency manipulation. It is not unusual for countries to manage their exchange rate the value of their currency relative to others to make their exports cheap while making others exports to them more expensive. This method has been used extensively by, among others, China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore aside from China, all signatories to the partnership. The American dollar is a prime target for these currency managers. First, the dollar is the global trading systems premier reserve currency, meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors. And Americans are a highly acquisitive people a nice way of saying we buy a lot of stuff. Consumer spending as a share of gross domestic product is about 70 percent here, 55 percent in Europe and 35 percent in China. Were steady customers for exportled economies. Theres nothing wrong with that, until these exporters start buying dollars to raise the value of the dollar relative to their own currencies, thus subsidizing their exports and taxing their imports. In the United States, the result is persistent trade deficits that have been a drag on growth and jobs betterthanaverage manufacturing jobs for decades. In a compelling argument for including a chapter in the TransPacific Partnership to restrict currency manipulation, C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that Americas trade deficit has averaged $200 billion to $500 billion per  higher as a result of the manipulation by the rest of the world, resulting in the loss of one million to five million jobs. The challenge is in the details. Countries buy foreign currencies for various reasons, not just to gain a trade advantage, and they shouldnt necessarily be held to account for doing so. Moreover, opponents of such a chapter argue that it would cover the actions of our own central bank, the Federal Reserve, and open it to charges that it also manipulates exchange rates. (When the Fed lowers the shortterm interest rate, or engages in quantitative easing to lower longerterm rates, one clear consequence is to lower the value of the dollar.) But that argument doesnt quite hold. Its a matter of intent, and there is a clear test: whether the central bank is engaging in domestic demand management or currency management, and the simplest way to tell is to observe whether the bank is buying foreign currencies. The Peoples Bank of China does a great deal of that. Our Fed does almost none. Its  to recognize that deals like the TransPacific Partnership are not necessarily about free trade. They are instead a set of rules; some, like lowering tariffs, lead to freer trade, while others, like expanding patent protections, are more protectionist. Rules governing currency tactics certainly fit the framework. Some purchasing of foreign currency should be fine under the TransPacific Partnership. Some developing economies collect dollars to cover their external debts in case of financial crises and large outflows of private capital. With this in mind, Mr. Bergsten suggests that holding enough foreign currency to cover a  worth of external liabilities might be a sound benchmark; anything more would be questionable. Once weve agreed on what currency management looks like, what actions would a chapter on it take? These could include a tax on the imports of offending countries, fines, the temporary canceling of certain trade privileges and my favorite, reciprocal currency intervention: If countries can go into currency markets and buy dollars, then we must be able to do the same with their currency. Thats not currently possible with China and other countries, which use capital controls to block such large purchases. Speaking of China, even though its not part of the partnership talks, rules like these, especially reciprocity, should be applied to it as well. Not to do so would put the signatory countries at a distinct disadvantage to a trade behemoth with a history of undervaluing its currency to maintain trade surpluses. As a White House economist in the first few  of the Obama administration, I learned that many of my colleagues shared my concerns about currency management. But all administrations believe the only way to do something about it is through quiet diplomacy. They believe that writing down rules in a trade agreement is too risky, with the potential to scuttle the whole deal. Diplomacy hasnt worked. A more direct approach is needed. If the trade deals supporters want an agreement worthy of broad support, this is a chance they cant afford to miss.

       " 'India turns to new industries for economic revival Victor Mallet, James Crabtree and Amy Kazmin in New Delhi Financial Times India will focus on entirely new industries including solar technology, LED lighting, small cars, medical appliances and weapons rather than trying to follow China into consumer electronics in its drive to become a global manufacturing power, according to one of its senior policy makers. What were trying to do is massively build out Indias productive capacity, Jayant Sinha, minister of state for finance and a former McKinsey partner,  in an interview in New Delhi. That is, in fact a veritable supply side revolution because what we are really trying to do is to position India for a decade or more of sustainable, noninflationary 7 to 8 per cent GDP growth. Its only if we can achieve those kinds of growth rates that we will be able to create the millions and millions of jobs we have to create every . Mr Sinha, a Harvard Business School alumnus, is one of the technocratic politicians charged by Narendra Modi, the prime minister, with helping to implement his Make in India vision after a collapse in economic growth to less than 5 per cent in the final two  of the previous Congress government. India is the worlds thirdlargest economy after the US and China, measured on a purchasing power parity basis, but manufacturing makes up only 15 per cent of gross domestic product, an unusually small share for an Asian developing economy. Mr Modi wants to boost that to 25 or even 30 per cent of GDP to help create the 1m jobs a month needed by new entrants to the workforce from the growing population of 1.3bn. But he will be hampered by clogged transport infrastructure, a shortage of skills, onerous labour laws that discourage investors, and the reluctance of indebted India companies to take on new risks. Make in India at this stage is still a slogan, admits one of Mr Sinhas government colleagues as business leaders and statesmen including US Secretary of State John Kerry, World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim and billionaire Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries converged on Mr Modis home state for the biennial Vibrant Gujarat summit.. Were not going to do manufacturing like the east Asians did. Were going to have to have a new model. Mr Sinha sees two broad aims in the Modi governments industrial policy: first, to meet Indias vast domestic demand for everything from steel and aluminium to refrigerators and motorcycles; second, to develop internationally competitive industries in new sectors. When China became a tremendous electronics manufacturing hub, it did that for smartphones, for instance, which did not exist as a product category, Mr Sinha . It did that in laptops, which did not exist as a product category. They didnt necessarily replicate what Japan was doing in automotive manufacturing. Similarly, I think there will be industries where India will become a global leader, but those are entirely new industries, for instance solar appliances, solar lanterns, solar home systems?.?.?.?India is already the world hub for small car design and manufacturing. Mr Sinha added: The India economic model is not the same as the Chinese economic model. Ours is a much more innovationdriven, bottomup approach towards economic growth?.?.?.?We will rely on our innovative and world class firms to be able to unlock these new manufacturing industries of the future. Some analysts dismiss this vision as overoptimistic, given the heavy debt burden weighing on many India conglomerates and the wariness of foreign industrial investors faced with unexpected tax demands and an array of regulatory and political obstacles that make it hard for them to turn a profit. Arvind Subramanian, Mr Modis newly appointed chief economic adviser, has noted the weakness of private investment and called for a loosening of mediumterm fiscal policy to make room for a surge of public investment in infrastructure. The first stage of Indias planned industrial revolution, therefore, is likely to put more emphasis on public spending for infrastructure than on private investment in new factories. Mr Sinha  the government was considering unlocking an additional $2550bn of public investment in the 201516 fiscal  to compensate for sluggish private spending, while the India railway network has plans for $100bn of investments in the next five . Piyush Goyal, minister for power, coal and renewable energy, has launched a $250bn plan for power generation and transmission to double electricity output and achieve Mr Modis promise of 24hour electricity for all by 2019. The economic reforms that weve pursued have been unprecedented in terms of scope and magnitude,  Mr Sinha, adding that Mr Modis Bharatiya Janata party government had done more than the Congress government that launched a series of liberalising reforms in 1991 to extract itself from a financial crisis. Now the government has to prove that its reforms and its industrial policy will actually work. Were at the bridge between the promise and the hubris,  Ashoka Mody, a sceptical USbased economist, and if theres disappointment [because after 1991] it would be the second time. India would lose credibility, and not just this government.',\n",
       " 'Australia, India move closer to FTA deal [e]Riley Beveridge CANBERRA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) Australia and India are edging ever closer to a historic free trade agreement, according to Australian trade and investment minister Andrew Robb. A delegation of around 400 Australians recently accompanied Robb to Gujarat, the home state of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where Robb told News Ltd. the \"first round of substantive discussions towards a free trade agreement with India\" was held. Robb was involved in short, but positive talks with Modi, before revealing to The Australian on Monday that the India leader \"was adamant that the deal is achievable this \". The news came less than two months after Modi visited Australia for the G20 summit in Brisbane, where both he and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott sought to agree on a free trade deal by the end of 2015. Such agreements would involve strengthening ties relating to mining investment, clean coal technology, counter terrorism, extending defence cooperation and  extensions to strong education links. Australia has already invested close to 5.7 billion U.S. dollars in India, who in turn has invested nearly 9 billion dollars back into the Australian economy. Those figures include 7.7 million dollars worth of Australian goods purchased by India in 2013 alone, with a further 1 billion dollars spent on education in Australia. Furthermore, according to Robb,\"it was obvious at the talks that Modi deeply values the Australian relationship\". A free trade agreement with India will represent another signification coup for the Australian government, following deals with China, Japan and South Korea throughout 2014.',\n",
       " 'China pushing limit with coal quality tests Amanda Saunders 12 January 2015 The Australian Financial Review Australian coal miners are concerned China could be misusing new import quality restrictions that came into effect this month to favour its struggling local coal industry. If China is taking extra licence with testing of its new import quality thresholds, it will affect Australian producers\\' ability to sell coal into the world largest market. Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Brendan Pearson  there appeared to be game playing at Chinese ports over the new rules. Industry sources  Australian coal is being tested for elements outside of the sulphur and ash content thresholds announced, and Chinese customs officers are threatening to slap penalties on shipments. \"We would be very concerned if the new standards were used as a mechanism for favouring domestic producers, because that would breach China commitments under the World Trade Organisation,\" Mr Pearson . \"It could be just be teething issues – but if it turns out there are blatant breaches, it is very  that any of these practices are stamped out right at the beginning.\" The new ban covers imports of coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 3 per cent sulphur to two of China most polluted regions – the Yangtze River Delta, near Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta, near Hong Kong. The restrictions already apply in the BeijingTianjin region. Improving air quality is part of the rationale for the change, but some Australian miners suspect the main game might be propping up China struggling domestic coal industry. When the new standards were unveiled in September, Australian miners thought they could work in its favour by edging out poorerquality competition. Australian coal is generally of higher quality than its main export competitors – Indonesia and South Africa, and most domestic Chinese producers. But industry sources  the tests being applied since the new rules came into effect on January 1 appeared to go beyond the original ban. If shipments are hit with penalties for falling foul of testing, the MCA  it would be akin to a tariff. \"We would be very concerned if the penalty became a de facto tariff charge,\" Mr Pearson . Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche  that perhaps there were \"not as clearcut benefits to Australian producers after all\". The new restrictions were being tested randomly, making Australian exporters nervous, he . \"The coalquality testing process in China is arbitrary and seemingly being used to favour local producers,\" Mr Roche . \"This is making Australian producers nervous. The process at the Chinese end is creating uncertainty for everyone trying to export thermal coal into China.\"Raising problem with Abbott government The MCA, which is the country top mining body, is planning to take the issue to key Abbott government ministers, some of whom are already aware of the shaky start to the rollout. \"We are very confident that the Australian government will remind China of its obligations under the WTO ,\" Mr Pearson . The fresh uncertainty comes as industry bodies  some Indonesian exporters have turned down coal orders from China to avoid falling foul of the new guidelines on poorerquality coal. Indonesia is the world biggest thermal coal exporter, followed by Australia. Less than two weeks into the new thresholds coming into effect, several shipments in Indonesia have been held back, Mr Roche . Indonesia can compete on costs with Australian coal – quality is the key differentiator. He  Indonesian suppliers have turned down orders from China, rather than send their coal cargoes to fail the quality test when they arrive at port in China. \"It is creating a bit of mischief with the Indonesian market,\" Mr Roche . \"It is in line with our prediction on the impacts of new Chinese quality control – that if they were going to hit anyone, it would be the Indonesians.\" But the erratic start to the enforcement of the new rules has taken the Australian industry by surprise. Local coal miners are already reeling from a prolonged period of depressed prices and high costs. Thermal coal has crashed to about $US62 a tonne from $US135 a tonne three  ago. Australia exports about 48 million tonnes of thermal coal to China each , which is about a quarter of the 200 million tonnes of thermal coal it ships annually. When China unveiled its new quality thresholds, Australia Bureau of Resource Economics  they could affect up to 25 million tonnes of coal sold each . The level of ash can be reduced through washing or blending the coal, but it could cost up to an additional $US4 a tonne at a time when the industry is immersed in a sea of red ink. Industry observers say China is unlikely to wear the extra cost of getting subquality coal up to the required standard. Thermal coal is used mostly to generate electricity, and is China chief source of energy.',\n",

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry led a roll call of leaders, including U.N. Secretary General Ban Kimoon and World Bank head Jim Yong Kim, converging on Modi home town of Gandhinagar for the Vibrant Gujarat business summit. U.S. President Barack Obama visits India later this month. Eight months into Modi rule, his failure to lift the economy from its longest growth slowdown in a generation has raised questions about how much substance there is behind his promise of \"red carpet, not red tape\". \"We\\'re trying to complete the circle of economic reforms speedily,\" Modi told the event that he founded when he was chief minister of the industrial state. \"We are also keen to see that our policies are predictable. We\\'re clear that our tax regime should be stable,\" Modi , speaking in English but making the occasional aside in Hindi. Along with speakers from Japan, Canada and Singapore, Kerry praised his host and avoided direct criticism. But he hinted at the need to cut back India stifling bureaucracy. \"We no longer live in a world where a country is going to be competitive if its bureaucracy sends people from door to door and window to window and meeting to meeting,\" he . PROMISED DEALS Modi spoke on Sunday of the achievements he hopes will help lift hundreds of millions of Indias out of poverty, including the opening of more than 100 million bank accounts, a \\'Make in India\\' campaign to promote manufacturing, and plans to expand the rail, road, energy and digital networks. \"We are planning to take a quantum leap,\" the 64old leader . Among the deals announced was a $4 billion agreement between U.S.based solar power firm SunEdison and India conglomerate Adani Enterprises, to build one of India largest solar panel makers. Vibrant Gujarat, held every two , has yielded billions of dollars in investment promises, though only a fraction of the deals announced have come to fruition.

       " 'Chinese ministry to help dairy farmers amid milk dumping, cow killing BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)  Sunday that it would help dairy farmers in northern China who have resorted to throwing out milk and killing their cows through lack of sales avenues. The ministry encourages dairy firms to increase purchasing, starts dairy production monitoring on a weekly basis, and strengthens policy support for the dairy industry, the ministry  in a statement. The ministry  it had talked to major dairy firms including Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and Mengniu Dairy Group, and urged them to purchase more milk, stabilize prices and safeguard interest of dairy farmers. The ministry will work together with other central government departments including the Ministry of Finance to map out more supportive policies to help dairy farmers to overcome their plight, it . \"A tonne of milk has to be discarded each day,\" dairy farmer Pei Shuke in east China Shandong Province . \"This desperate thing rarely happened before.\" Similar cases have spread to other major milkproducing areas in China, including Hebei and Inner Mongolia. Slumping milk prices since the second half of 2014 have pushed many dairy farmers to desperation. Milk prices fell for ten consecutive months starting in February 2014. In the first three quarters of last , they dived to 3.84 yuan per kg from 4.26 yuan per kg, and the trend showed no signs of stopping in the last three months of 2014. The dairy sector downturn has come as a surprise to many. In late 2013, China dairy products saw a price hike following a production decrease caused by disease and farmers leaving the industry. Milk prices jumped to more than 5 yuan (0.8 U.S. dollars) per kilogram in December 2013 from 3.4 yuan per kg a  earlier. The dairy boom sent ripples of excitement through the sector, with farmers purchasing large numbers of dairy cows at high prices to boost production. But the boom proved to be a flash in the pan. In March 2014, foreign milk prices began to fall drastically due to overproduction. Many dairy companies resorted to cheap overseas sources and limited purchases from domestic suppliers, causing dairy prices to dip to new lows.',\n",
       " 'South American nations struggle to find new economic model John Paul Rathbone in London and Joe Leahy in São Paulo Four  ago, when the Chinadriven commodity price boom was in full swing and southsouth ties were all the rage, Dilma Rousseff began her first term as Brazil’s president with a symbolic gesture — jetting off to Beijing. Now, as commodity prices collapse alongside China’s slowing economy, Ms Rousseff has begun her second presidential term by saying she wants to rebuild relations with Washington. She has barely mentioned Beijing. The shift reflects broader changes in South America’s commoditydependent economies, where the abrupt collapse in energy, food and metals prices has opened up dangerous trade and financing gaps that could force deep economic and political change. In Colombia and Peru, where commodities account for twothirds of exports, current account deficits are forecast to reach 5 per cent of gross domestic product this  — a level not seen since the 1990s when the region was associated with default. Soyarich Argentina and oilproducing Venezuela are suffering from dwindling foreign reserves. As for Brazil, where commodities account for 60 per cent of exports, its trade deficit last  widened to $4bn — the same as in 1999, when Brazil was sucked into a global emergingmarkets crisis. “I am very worried. In fact I have been worried for ,”  José Antonio Ocampo, a professor at Columbia University in New York and a former Colombian finance minister. “Commodity prices\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009were bound to fall, sooner or later.” Even in 2008, when commodity prices peaked, South America ran a combined current account deficit equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP. Now the situation is far worse. Should prices drop to 2003 levels, the region’s current account deficit would be about 7 per cent of GDP, Mr Ocampo estimates. The challenge of financing this gap, equivalent to about $350bn, poses the region’s “greatest risk”, he says. Although the whole region is affected, there is a spectrum of concern. At one extreme are spendthrifts such as Venezuela, where investors fear a bond default following the halving of the price of oil, which accounts for 96 per cent of its exports. Last week, Caracas turned to Beijing for a bailout. At the other are more prudent countries, such as Chile and Peru, which have ample fiscal and hard currency reserves. Brazil lies between. “Investors are discriminating, so I don’t expect contagion from any Venezuelan default,”  Neil Shearing of Capital Economics consultancy. “There are also several reasons why a 1980sstyle debt bust is unlikely.” The first is improved economic policy making, especially the use of floating exchange rates, which act as a buffer. The Brazilian, Colombian and Chilean currencies have dropped more than a quarter in the past two . “In some ways, investors have already panicked,”  Mr Shearing. However, Argentina and Venezuela have fixed exchange rates, while oilexporting Ecuador is dollarised. Elsewhere, weaker currencies can close trade gaps by boosting exports. Rapid depreciation also feeds inflation, however, prompting central banks to raise interest rates, which slows the economy. This has been Brazil’s experience. You have to understand that commodities are subject to deep cycles. Don’t get too carried away during the good  Alberto Ramos, Goldman Sachs economist “It is a marathon,”  Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. “[Brazil’s] adjustment could last more than a .” Another reason is that most of the region has low debt and enjoys access to abundant international liquidity to plug financing gaps. “I am optimistic here,”  Mr Ocampo. Yet, although South America attracted copious foreign investment in the past decade, reaching $188bn last , more than a third has been into mining and energy. Such investments could now dry up. Furthermore, high foreign reserves do not always offer protection for indebted corporates when currencies plunge — as Russia shows. South American companies have about $300bn of hard currency bonds, according to Bank of America, a figure dominated by Brazil’s Petrobras, where a corruption scandal has locked the state oil company and some subcontractors out of capital markets. The broad implications for South America from this new state of affairs are threefold. First, belttightening will slow growth. Brazil is cutting public spending by 2 per cent of GDP, while Colombia has increased taxes to cover revenue shortfalls. “Slower growth is the new normal,”  Mr Shearing. Second, the region needs a new postboom economic model, especially if local manufacturing were to be hollowed out by cheap Chinese imports. Greater economic orthodoxy may result. “You have to understand that commodities are subject to deep cycles,”  Mr Ramos. “Don’t get too carried away during the good .” Third, there may be a reemphasis on northsouth trade ties that languished during the commodity bonanza. Ms Rousseff’s desire to improve US relations — and even Washington’s rapprochement with Cuba, as the latter’s benefactor, Venezuela, bounces off the ropes — may be two early signs of this.

The deadline for submissions under the monitoring and evaluation phase of the Fifth Global Review of Aid for Trade, a biennial joint exercise of the WTO and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, was pushed back from Dec. 31 following requests from a number of delegations, the announcement . According to the WTO, the aim of the exercise is “to survey how trade costs affect developing countries' competitiveness and ability to connect to regional and global value chains, what is being done to address this issue, and how Aid for Trade can help reduce trade costs and the associated impacts to deliver inclusive, sustainable growth.” In announcing the theme of the review in October, WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo and OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria  high trade costs act as a “brake” on the trade integration of many developing countries, and particularly of leastdeveloped countries. The aim of the review, they , is to draw lessons about reducing such trade costs from the experiences of the trade and development community. To that end, the WTO and OECD are soliciting selfassessment questionnaires and case stories from bilateral and multilateral donor agencies, regional economic communities, developing and leastdeveloped countries, the private sector, academia and nongovernmental organizations, the announcement . The questionnaires ask for a wide variety of information about trade costs and aid. One question asks partner governments to identify challenges they may face in implementing the Trade Facilitation Agreement. The WTO agreement to streamline customs procedures has long had the support of the OECD, which has  developing countries will experience the bulk of benefits under the TFA (87 WTO, 5/6/13). A number of interested parties have submitted questionnaire responses and case studies for the review, according to the announcement, including 37 partner countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United Nations Development Programme.

       " 'USDA Urging Countries To Roll Back Bans On U.S. Poultry Tied To Avian Flu World Trade Online Posted: January 12, 2015 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is engaging with a range of U.S. trading partners to persuade them to narrow or eliminate restrictions they have imposed on imports of U.S. poultry following two cases of highpathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detected last month in Oregon and Washington state, according to a USDA spokeswoman. In particular, USDA is urging countries such as South Korea and Thailand that have imposed a blanket ban on all U.S. poultry to adopt narrower measures, such as limiting their ban to poultry originating from the affected region. Canada, Japan and Singapore have adopted this more targeted approach from the outset. \"Regarding trade restrictions, some countries such as South Korea, Russia and Thailand have imposed bans impacting the entire United States. We are actively engaging with most of these countries to reduce these restrictions,\" a USDA spokeswoman  a Jan. 8 statement. The European Union has also imposed a blanket ban on imports of poultry from the United States as a result of the flu cases. \"Other countries, such as Canada, Japan and Singapore, have limited impacts to defined regions in the State where a finding occurred,\" the spokeswoman . Although the U.S. poultry industry considers the approach of banning only imports from Oregon and Washington to be \"reasonable\" within international rules, both a USDA statement and a poultry industry source emphasized that the two incidents of bird flu in Washington and Oregon have not occurred in a commercial operation, and instead have been limited to wild birds and a socalled \"backyard flock.\" USDA announced on Dec. 17 that it had confirmed the presence of two different HPAI strains in flocks of wild birds in northern Washington state, and on Dec. 18 announced the presence of HPAI in a \"backyard poultry flock\" of about 100 birds in Oregon. The current cases differ from other reported outbreaks of avian influenza in that they are highly pathogenic, which is usually more fatal to birds than the lowpathogenic strain. Highpathogenic outbreaks are also more rare than lowpathogenic outbreaks, according to a poultry industry source. HPAI is listed by the World Organization for Animal Health as a notifiable disease, while lowpathogenic outbreaks do not necessitate notifications. In a Jan. 5 statement, USDA characterized some of the new restrictions imposed by trading partners as overreactions to the outbreaks, emphasizing that the virus has not entered commercial poultry operations. \"Unfortunately, some countries have decided to place far more restrictive measures than necessary on U.S. poultry, including, in a few instances, bans on imports of all U.S. poultry and poultry products,\" the statement . \"We disagree with these actions and are taking a number of steps to address them and help support the U.S. poultry industry.\" In all, 30 countries and the EU so far have imposed some type of restriction on imports of U.S. poultry, according to USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The United Arab Emirates, by contrast, has issued a statement positively certifying that U.S. poultry is indeed eligible for importation, citing the fact that the outbreak has not occurred in a commercial flock. Japan has stipulated that poultry slaughtered on or after Dec. 3, 2014 that either originated from, was slaughtered, processed or stored in Washington state would be ineligible for import, according to FSIS. Canada has also declared that raw poultry and raw poultry products from Washington and Oregon are currently prohibited for entry. An outbreak of avian influenza occurred in December in the Canadian province of British Columbia, which borders Washington state. The U.S. since Dec. 22 has prohibited imports of poultry from the southern part of British Columbia. South Korea has banned imported of U.S. poultry and poultry products derived from birds slaughtered and processed on or after Nov. 25, 2014, according to FSIS. The EU on Dec. 24 took a similar action. FSIS  poultry meat and poultry meat products are not eligible for export to the EU as of Dec. 19, 2014, and that the same products are also ineligible for transit via the EU if they come from Oregon or Washington. Sri Lanka and Thailand also have imposed blanket restrictions. According to Commerce Department data, U.S. poultry and egg exports to Canada were $131 million in 2013. Exports to the EU, Korea and Japan during the same  totaled $27.8 million, $4.8 million and $1.78 million, respectively. Among the other trading partners that have banned imports of U.S. poultry from Washington and Oregon are Colombia, Peru and several other Latin American countries. Three countries so far have imposed restrictions on poultry imports from Washington or Oregon by county: Hong Kong, Macedonia and the Philippines. The poultry industry source  some countries, such as Japan, have already rolled back their restrictions following consultations with the U.S., and that more could pull back their restrictions once USDA has successfully convinced them that that the outbreak was limited to wild and \"backyard\" flock. A backyard flock, he explained, is a private collection of animals sometimes used for personal poultry or egg consumption that does not interact with commercial operations. This source echoed USDA in saying the most problematic restrictions for the U.S. industry are the ones that place broad bans on poultry imports for the entire U.S. He  that this type of action unfairly affects producers in different states and regions distant from Oregon and Washington, such as major production states like Georgia and Delaware. He  that the restrictions based on state or region can be considered reasonable compared to the blanket, nationwide restrictions. He noted that the U.S. is unlikely to convince Russia to roll back its blanket restrictions for political reasons. Russia has already banned imports of U.S. poultry for consumption in Russia since Aug. 7, 2014, as a retaliation for Western sanctions on Moscow for its involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Russia had continued to allow the transit of U.S. poultry products destined for other countries – usually former Soviet republics – through Russian territory, but on Dec. 5 blocked such shipments for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) reasons. He also noted that USDA could avoid some of these situations by getting countries to renegotiate their health certification protocols. He gave the example of Korea, which currently requires an FSIS certification that there has been no reported HPAI incident in the U.S. within the last six months – even if there has been no detection in a commercial operation. Before the incidents in Washington and Oregon, USDA warned of an HPAI outbreak in wild birds in the southern half of the Canadian province British Columbia, which shares a border with Washington. On Dec. 22, Customs and Border Protection announced it was enforcing a USDA restriction on certain bird and poultry products including uncooked chicken, turkey, raw eggs, live birds, hatching eggs, and other products. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most recent HPAI outbreak occurred in Texas in 2004. Approximately 7,000 chickens were in that flock, and the virus was not transmitted to humans, according to the CDC.',\n",

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) voted against revoking the existing duty orders on lawn groomers from China, saying it \"would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time.\" The U.S. Commerce Department is required to remove an antidumping or countervailing duty order, or terminate a suspension agreement, after five  unless the department and the ITC vote against it, according to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The United States initially issued the antidumping duty orders on imports of lawn groomers from China in 2009. The Commerce Department agreed to institute the first five review of the measures in July, 2014 and the ITC voted to conduct an expedited review in October, 2014. In November 2014, the Commerce Department determined that revocation of the existing duty orders on lawn groomers from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping at weightedaverage margins up to 386.28 percent. As a result of the ITC affirmative determination, the existing order on imports of these products from China will remain in place. Beijing has repeatedly urged Washington to honor its commitment against protectionism and work with China to maintain a free, open and just trade environment.',\n",

       " 'U.S. moves to make Mexican trucks permanent By Heather Caygle | 1/9/15 4:50 PM EST POLITICO Federal officials are making permanent a controversial three pilot program that allows Mexican truckers to haul goods inside the U.S. beyond the border zone. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will soon start accepting applications from Mexican truckers who didn’t participate in the pilot but want the authority to operate beyond the U.S.Mexico border region. “Opening the door to a safe crossborder trucking system with Mexico is a major step forward in strengthening our relationship with the nation’s third largest trading partner, and in meeting our obligations under NAFTA,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx  in a statement. The move is likely to be met with significant backlash from groups representing independent truckers and labor interests, who teamed up in 2011 to unsuccessfully sue DOT in an attempt to scuttle the program. The program’s fate has been uncertain over the last few months, with the pilot having expired in midOctober and DOT reluctant to offer any clues about its future. Critics maintain that FMCSA didn’t have enough participants to determine if it would be safe to make the program permanent, an assessment the DOT’s Inspector General agreed with in a report late last month. FMCSA maintains the program is safe, saying the agency’s decision also took into account safety data from the nearly 1,000 Mexico carriers already allowed to operate beyond the U.S. border zone. A FMCSA analysis determined that those carriers and the 15 pilot participants operated just as safely as U.S. and Canadian carriers over the life of the program. Federal officials have  that it was hard to get truckers to participate in the pilot because FMCSA’s initial attempt at a crossborder trucking program abruptly ended in 2009 after Congress eliminated funding. That resulted in retaliation from Mexico, which accused the U.S. of violating NAFTA trade requirements, and potentially scared off some Mexican carriers. The two countries reached a deal in 2011— Mexico would temporarily lift the tariffs in exchange for the U.S. reinstituting the pilot program. FMCSA making the program permanent is expected to satisfy NAFTA provisions and result in the permanent end of more than $2 billion in annual retaliatory tariffs. “We have been, and will continue to work with Mexico to ensure that the threat of retaliatory duties will now be brought to a swift conclusion as well,” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in a statement. FMCSA submitted a report to Congress on the program today and plans to publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing it’s accepting operating applications from Mexican truckers.

       " 'China misses trade growth target Jamil Anderlini and Lucy Hornby in Beijing Financial Times January 13, 2015 6:59 am China’s trade with the rest of the world missed the government’s target for the third  in a row in 2014 as external demand failed to offset the slowing domestic economy, official data released on Tuesday show. Total Chinese trade increased 3.4 per cent in 2014, compared with an annual goal of 7.5 per cent growth set by the Communist party at the start of last . The missed target comes as China prepares to release annual gross domestic product figures next week that will show growth in the world’s largest economy (in purchasing power terms) came in below the government’s annual target for the first time since 1998. Growth below last ’s target of “around 7.5 per cent” will also mark the slowest Chinese expansion in a quarter of a century. The economy is expected to have grown by between 7.2 per cent and 7.4 per cent last . The last time China’s growth rate was below 7.5 per cent was in 1990 when the country was still under international sanctions in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The  the tanks rolled in, 1989, is the only other time the economy has missed the government’s forecast since Beijing began publishing targets in 1986. Despite falling short of expectations last , China’s trade and wider economy are still performing better than nearly every other major economy, with net exports making a positive contribution to GDP growth for the first time in four . That was partly due to subdued domestic demand combined with lower commodity prices. Imports increased just 0.4 per cent for the  in dollar terms, compared with a 6.1 per cent increase in exports. Beijing is expected to drop its GDP growth target this  to “around 7 per cent” and also to lower its annual trade growth target. “This is the third straight  that China has missed the trade growth target, reflecting weak external demand as well as weak domestic demand,”  Liu Ligang, chief China economist at ANZ bank. “As imports continued to underperform, China registered another huge monthly trade surplus in December.” China reported a series of record monthly trade surpluses last  and its full trade surplus of more than $380bn is also the highest on record, up nearly 50 per cent from 2013. That will reduce the likelihood of any big depreciation this . Some officials and analysts have suggested China may take steps to depreciate its tightly controlled currency, especially as the renminbi has appreciated significantly in recent months against most currencies thanks to its loose peg to the strengthening US dollar. “We can continue to expect large trade surpluses going forward, which will put pressure on the renminbi to appreciate further in tradeweighted terms,”  Julian EvansPritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. China’s trade with the EU, its biggest trade partner, rose 8.9 per cent last  while trade with the US, its secondlargest partner, increased 5.4 per cent. Following a period of deep animosity and fiery rhetoric over historical grievances going back to the second world war, China’s trade with Japan contracted 1 per cent last . China’s iron ore imports surged 14 per cent in 2014, as cheap imports displaced more expensive and lowerquality ore from domestic mines. Plunging international prices pushed down the import bill for the ore by 13 per cent last , despite the higher volumes of imports. Growing steel output despite weak demand from China’s construction sector has pushed excess Chinese production into international markets. Steel exports ballooned, rising 50 per cent  on  to 93.8m tonnes, but on average mills received 13 per cent less on each tonne they sold. The steel sector’s reliance on exports is not the only sign of commodityrelated weakness in the Chinese economy. Copper imports — normally a leading indicator for industrial demand — slipped 7.6 per cent in 2014.',\n",
       " 'Oil rout takes Brent to near 6 low Anjli Raval Financial Times January 13, 2015 8:06 am Record crude imports from China failed to curb further falls in oil prices, which approached fresh six lows on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate have fallen almost 60 per cent since the middle of June to levels last seen in early 2009. Ice February Brent fell a further $2.04 to $45.39 a barrel, while Nymex February West Texas Intermediate declined $1.57 to $44.50. Rising oil output from the US and sustained Opec production has coincided with weak global demand. The surplus has put pressure on oil prices that analysts say is likely to continue in the coming months as excess supplies stand between 12m barrels a day. Trade data showed China imported 30.37m tonnes of crude in December, up 19.5 per cent monthonmonth. Although it was expected that lower oil prices might spur Chinese buying for its strategic reserves, analysts question how sustained this will be and if it will translate into real purchases by consumers amid weak underlying demand. Meanwhile, Opec has showed no signs of capitulation in maintaining output at 30m barrels a day despite poorer members of the cartel such as Venezuela voicing their ire at lower prices. Oil minister for the United Arab Emirates, Suhail bin Mohammed al Mazrouei,  he was still confident Opec’s November decision made in Vienna was the right one. Ahead of the prior trading session, Goldman Sachs cut its average Brent forecast for 2015 to $50.40 a barrel from $83.75 following a string of analysts revisions. They lowered their outlook for US crude to $47.15 a barrel from $73.75 adding that oil would need to fall lower for longer before the country’s shale oil production takes a meaningful hit',\n",
       " 'Opinion: No Nation Wants To Be Labeled \"Least Developed\" By Ahmed Sareer * 12 January 2015 Inter Press Service NEW YORK, Jan. 10, 2015 (IPS/GIN) Since 1971, Maldives is one of only three countries that have graduated from the ranks of the world \"least developed countries\" (LDCs) the other two being Botswana and Cape Verde. The Maldives graduated on Jan. 1, 2011. The review of LDCs conducted in 1997 concluded that the Maldives was ready for immediate graduation. The Maldives government argued that the U.N. criteria for graduation should include a \"smooth transition period\" in order to bring into place adequate adjustments necessary for full transition into middleincome country status. The U.N. Resolution adopted on Dec. 20, 2004 endorsed and adopted these arguments. Under that resolution, the Maldives was set to graduate from the list of LDCs on Jan. 1, 2008. Just six days after adoption of the resolution, the India Ocean tsunami struck the Maldives. The Maldives economy, which had grown at an average of eight percent per annum for two consecutive , was devastated by the tsunami: 62 percent of the GDP was destroyed; over seven percent of the population was internally displaced; social and economic infrastructure damaged or destroyed in over one quarter of the inhabited islands; 12 inhabited islands were turned into complete rubble. Following the disaster, and on the request of the Maldives, the General Assembly decided to defer the graduation until 2011, with a smooth transition period until 2014. Donors often assess a country need by its developmental status at the U.N., which traps countries such as the Maldives in a vicious cycle being now termed as the \"Middle Income Paradox\". Graduation from LDC does not help a country to overcome the development challenges it faces. Graduation does not make a country less vulnerable to the consequences of its geography. It is no secret that small island states being assessed for graduation, do not meet the threshold for economic vulnerability. Small island states often achieve their high development status because of high and consistent investment in human resources, and the social sector as well as government administration. This leaves limited financial resources for the country to prepare for natural disasters or to carry out mitigation and adaptation measures. Countries often have to rely on multilateral and bilateral donors for assistance for environmental projects: donors that often assess a country need by its developmental status at the U.N., which traps countries such as the Maldives in a vicious cycle being now termed as the \"Middle Income Paradox\". However, all this is conveniently ignored or overlooked. Graduation from LDC status need not be feared, nor does it need to be an obstacle in a country development path. We only fear what we don\\'t know. The Maldives\\' experience showed that due to the infancy of the graduation programme, the relatively low number of countries that have graduated, and the lack of coordinated commitment from bilateral partners, the graduation process has been far from smooth. The General Assembly Resolution, which the Maldives helped to coordinate, adopted in December 2012 provided a smooth transition for countries graduated from the LDC list. The resolution has put into place greater oversight ability for the U.N. and articulated the need for a strengthened consultative mechanism for the coordination of bilateral aid. The Maldives has tried to make the path for subsequent graduates smoother. Yet, it is a fact that the graduation process still relies on flawed criteria. While no country wants to be termed the \"Least\" on any group, it cannot be denied that inherent vulnerabilities and geophysical realities of some of the countries that often extend beyond their national jurisdiction, need help that are specific and targeted, in order to improve the resilience of those countries. It is for that reason that the Maldives lobbied extensively with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to extend the application of TRIPS for all LDCs. Following graduation, the Maldives also applied to join the EU Generalised System of Preferences but new regulations prevented Maldives from the scheme. This posed a significant loss to our fishing industry, which is the export sector in the economy. The Maldives has been continually exploring the viability of a \"small and vulnerable economy\" category at the U.N., similar to that which exists in the World Trade Organisation. Such a category will acknowledge the particular needs of countries arising from the smallness of their economies and inherent geographical realities. Small island states have continually argued that special consideration needs to be given to SIDS that are slated for graduation. Yet, these voices of concern have fallen largely on deaf . But the needs of our people, the development we desire cannot wait to be recognised. That is why the Maldives decided to take our development path into our own hands. This can be done by consistently employing good policies. Development is the result of a combination of bold decisions and an ability to seize the opportunities. SIDS have shown to the world that we are not short of smart ideas. Rather than relying on others, we have to develop our own economies our way! *Ahmed Sareer is Ambassador/Permanent Representative of Maldives to the United Nations & Ambassador of Maldives to the United States of America.

       " 'World Bank cuts forecast for growth Ferdinando Giugliano, Economics Correspondent Financial Times January 13, 2015 9:02 pm The World Bank has cut its forecast for global growth, warning that the world economy remained overly reliant on the “single engine” of the US recovery. The Bank  it expected lower oil prices to provide a boost to global activity. But it warned several headwinds would mitigate the effect of the falling cost of crude. These include weak confidence among consumers and businesses and the inability of big central banks to cut interest rates below their recordlow levels to boost inflation expectations. “The global economy is running on a single engine,”  Kaushik Basu, chief economist at the World Bank. “It is only the US economy that is forging ahead in a global economy with so much uncertainty. We need several engines,” he added. In its twicely Global Economic Prospects, the World Bank forecasts the world economy will expand by 3 per cent this  and by 3.3 per cent in 2016. In June the Bank’s economists had predicted global growth this  and next to be 3.4 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. The Bank lifted its forecasts for growth in the US this  from 3 per cent to 3.2 per cent, while slashing those for the eurozone from 1.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent. The UK is expected to grow by 2.9 per cent in 2015. Middleincome countries were hit by a raft of downgrades, with Russia now expected to contract by 2.9 per cent instead of growing by 1.5 per cent. South Asia provided a rare bright spot, with forecasts for 2015 lifted by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1 per cent. The Washingtonbased institution  it expected the 60 per cent drop in the cost of crude since June to lift growth by around 0.5 per cent over the medium run. But the Bank struck a downbeat tone on the prospects for the world economy. “Risks to this slowmoving global recovery are significant and tilted to the downside,” the report . The most significant threat to the recovery listed by the Bank is the normalisation of monetary policy in the US. Last week, minutes from the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee showed the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates from 00.25 per cent as soon as April. The Bank fears this could lead to a sudden tightening of financial conditions for governments and corporates in emerging markets, which have enjoyed low borrowing costs. However, the Bank does not expect a repeat of the turmoil that hit developing countries in the summer of 2013, when the Fed first revealed it might pull back from its programme of quantitative easing. “The adjustment in developing countries to financial tightening is expected to proceed more smoothly,” the report . Mr Basu  he did not think monetary tightening in the US would force central banks in emerging markets into sudden interest rates hikes. “Central banks in emerging markets will have to react but the reaction will not have to be any more muscular than oneandahalf  ago,” he explained. Last October, the International Monetary Fund lowered its forecasts for global growth, saying the world economy would expand by 3.3 per cent in 2015 instead of 3.4 per cent. The IMF’s latest batch of economic forecasts will be released next week in an update to its twicely World Economic Outlook.',\n",
       " 'China Responds To U.S. Bird Flu Incidents With Blanket Poultry Ban World Trade Online Posted: January 13, 2015 China, a major market for U.S. poultry exporters, has become the latest in a string of countries to ban U.S. poultry products due to an outbreak of highpathogenic avian influenza in Oregon and Washington state. China Ministry of Agriculture and General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine imposed the restriction effective Jan. 8, according to a Jan. 12 press release from the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council (USAPEEC). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Jan. 12 also added China to the list of countries to which U.S. poultry producers are no longer eligible to ship as a result of the outbreak. USAPEEC President Jim Sumner  in the statement that \"there absolutely no justification for China to take such a drastic action,\" and emphasized that the outbreaks in Oregon and Washington were \"isolated and remote incidents are hundreds if not thousands of miles away from major poultry and egg production areas.\" \"Most all of our other trading partners have taken some sort of regionalized approach, and have limited their restrictions to the state or, in some cases, to the county,\" he . \"We would have expected China to do the same.\" Sumner also highlighted that the ban includes breeding stock, which he  means the Chinese industry will not be able to \"replenish and maintain its production.\" According to a USDA spokeswoman, China banned U.S. poultry due to the avian flu findings. She added that \"USDA is actively working with the poultry industry, trade associations, and others to mitigate the impact on exports.\" However, the spokeswoman stopped short of saying if USDA is engaging directly with Chinese authorities to convince Beijing to roll back the ban. USDA has been engaging with most of the countries imposing blanket restrictions; a poultry industry source  both Washington and Beijing will likely begin talking within the next month, but that discussions might not have begun yet because of how recently China imposed the ban. According to USDA data, U.S. poultry exports to China, excluding eggs, totaled $286.6 million during JanuaryNovember 2014, a decrease of 29 percent from $402.9 million during the same time period in 2013. That made it the fourthlargest export market for U.S. poultry behind Mexico, Canada and Hong Kong. Full  2014 data is not yet available. A poultry industry source noted that U.S. exporters are already wrestling with duties that China put in place last  to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that faulted the methodology Beijing had used to calculate antidumping and countervailing duties on U.S. broiler chicken. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in an annual report released last month  that it was \"evaluating its next steps to take in this dispute\" after China had recalculated those duties to comply with the ruling; the U.S. in July 2014 rejected China claim that the new duties fell into compliance. USDA did not immediate return an request for comment on whether China actions would have any bearing on exports to Hong Kong as well. Hong Kong separately issued more limited restrictions on imports from Douglas County, Ore. and Benton County, Wash. The U.S. poultry industry source noted, however, that much of the poultry currently shipped from the U.S. to Hong Kong is ultimately bound for consumers in mainland China. More than 30 countries so far have placed some sort of restriction on imports of U.S. poultry, with most countries singling out imports from the affected states or counties within those states. China joins South Korea, Thailand, Russia and the European Union among countries placing blanket bans on all U.S. poultry',\n",
       " 'China Ministry: Abolished Rare Earth Export Quota Due to WTO Decision By ChuinWei Yap 13 January 2015 Dow Jones Newswires Chinese (English) BEIJINGChina abolished a quota system limiting its exports of rareearth minerals due to a decision by the World Trade Organization that ruled against the policy, the commerce ministry  Tuesday. \"The government has had to take a full range of economic means to effectively manage and bring order to rare earth resources,\" the ministry  in a statement. \"The abolition of the quota is to coordinate domestic and international markets.\" The Wall Street Journal reported last week that China had abolished the quota.

       " 'The Geopolitics of 17 Very Obscure Minerals Bloomberg, Jan 12, 2015 6:25 AM EST By Adam Minter Rare earths aren\\'t the world sexiest commodity. The 17 elements are notoriously difficult to extract from the ground and have brazenly obscure names. (Don\\'t make the classic rookie mistake of confusing yttrium with ytterbium.) But what they lack in branding, they certainly make up for in utility and ubiquity: they’re essential to products as wideranging as wind turbines, smartphones, hightech weapon systems, and even your fishing reel. Although the United States was once a major supplier of rare earths, China has been the world’s primary source since the 1990s. And that makes them more than just a commodity; they\\'re a test of how China vast economic and diplomatic ambitions bear on one another. As recent events demonstrate, they\\'re also a window into understanding that, even in the face of obstacles, China won\\'t give them up so easily. As recently as 2013 China provided 86 percent of the world rare earths supply and, especially over the past several , Chinese officials have made no secret of their plans to use their accumulating monopoly power. In 2009, a senior official in Inner Mongolia, home to China’s most productive rare earth mine, explained to Xinhua, the state newswire, that export controls on rare earths (dating back to 1999) were designed “to attract more Chinese and foreign investors into the region.” This was a message to companies the world over: if you want to ensure continued access to rare earths, you’d better relocate your factory to China. Then, in September 2010, China abruptly blocked export of rare earths to Japan after Japan detained one of its fishermen caught in waters claimed by both countries. Only after he was released did the flow of rare earths start again. But for Japan and the United States, two of its biggest and most vulnerable rare earth customers and two of China’s biggest geopolitical rivals the implication was clear: when it comes to rare earths, China saw no reason to separate economic goals from political ones. In the words of thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton, China’s application of political pressure against Japan served as a \"wake up call.\" In one sense, that call came too late. By 2011, several foreign users of rare earths had already relocated production to China, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, fear and speculation served to drive up prices. For example, cerium a rare earth often used in aluminum and iron alloys rocketed from $6 per pound in 2008 to a record of $77 per pound in August 2011. But the demand both political and economic for alternative sources of rare earths soon began to shift the market. Alternatives to Chinese rare earths quickly began cropping up, whether via recycling, new mines, alternative materials, or even smuggling. In July 2010, the Coloradobased Molycorp raised $393.8 million in an IPO, the proceeds of which went to reopening a rare earths mine it had closed the previous decade. For its part, Japan set a goal of securing 60 percent of its rare earth supply from outside of China by 2018. By mid2011, the combination of conservation, new mine, and alternative materials had produced a price crash from which the rare earth market has yet to recover completely. And this has forced China to change course: on New Years’ Day Beijing lifted the 15 old export controls on rare earth minerals, in accord with the WTO ruling. But it would be naive to expect China to give up its mercantile aspirations without a fight. Indeed, rescinding the export quotas wasn\\'t a very significant concession in the first place: demand has fallen off so significantly that the quotas had ceased to be an issue. During the first 11 months of 2014, for example, China exported 24,866 metric tons of rare earths significantly less than the full quota of 30,611 tons. Thus, when the WTO ruled in March 2013 that China’s export controls on rare earths and other industrial metals violated its rules, China didn’t so much as complain. Moreover, rather than abandoning its plans for rare earths, China has already moved onto its Plan B: consolidating the industry into two stateowned conglomerates. The thought seems to be that consolidation will address one of the main problems in China’s domestic market: the proliferation of private mines and wildcatters who can and do supply smugglers. This isn\\'t to suggest that the West should be lamenting the disappearance of these smaller mines they tend to be especially destructive to the environment. But it seems pretty obvious that China decisionmaking in this case is motivated less by environmental concerns than a desire to maintain its monopoly power. “The move will help the country maintain its pricing power for rare earth products,” reported Caixin, a Chinese business magazine in August. It’s an open question whether Chinese industrial policy can maintain the country’s rare earths primacy and a return to high rare earth prices via consolidation. But, if their goal is to maintain the country’s geopolitical leverage, they probably don’t need to do anything at all. As the Wall Street Journal noted in December 2013, even if China doesn’t dominate rare earth mining, it continues to dominate rare earth processing (the dirty, dangerous, energyintensive and expensive process of turning rare earths into something useful). Even Molycorp, the company that was meant to be America’s great rare earths hope, sends some of its rare earths to China for processing, and that’s unlikely to change. The company, whose shares reached $77.54 in 2011, at the rare earth market peak, closed at $.60 on Friday. Unless there’s a dramatic change in rare earth prices in the near term, there’s no guarantee that Molycorp will even have enough cash to make it to the end of the , much less build an expensive processing operation. Either way, China’s new rare earth conglomerates which enjoy statebacking to cover their losses seem likely to continue their dominance for  to come.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Tells WTO of Lithuanian Meat Import Proposal, Raising Hopes of EU Officials By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 14, 2015 Jan. 13 –The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is proposing to add Lithuania to the list of countries it considers eligible to import meat products to the U.S., according to World Trade Organization documents released Jan. 13. The proposal would permit imports of meat from cattle, sheep, swine and goats slaughtered in Lithuania and processed in certified Lithuanian establishments, according to a recent USDA notice. The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)  that its review of Lithuania laws, regulations and inspection implementation shows “that its meat inspection system requirements are equivalent to the [U.S.] Federal Meat Inspection Act and its implementing regulations,” according to the notice. Stakeholders are permitted to comment on the Lithuanian meat proposal until Feb. 17. Broader EU Prospects? The proposal could renew prospects for wider approval of other European Union meat exports to the U.S. following the USDA recent decision to permit Irish beef imports. The U.S.  that Ireland had implemented an adequate beef slaughter inspection system to meet U.S. food safety standards, according to a Jan. 5 letter from FSIS. EU health and trade officials hailed the decision and urged the U.S. to roll back its ban on meat exports from other EU nations. EU meat exports to the U.S. have been restricted since 1998 due to health concerns stemming from incidents of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) found in EU livestock.',\n",
       " 'EU gives member states power to block GM crops Christian Oliver in Brussels Financial Times January 13, 2015 6:25 pm The EU has sought to resolve  of acrimony over the status of genetically modified crops by giving each of its 28 member states the final say over whether they can be grown within their borders. While GM crops are common in America and Asia, they remain divisive in Europe. Brussels has repeatedly insisted that US companies such as Monsanto will not be able to use a transatlantic trade deal under negotiation with Washington to push Europe to buy more GM crops. At the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, lawmakers voted that each national government should be allowed to ban the planting of GM crops, even if they had been declared safe by Brussels. This rare optout from Europe’s hallowed single market showed how intractable positions had become. The measure was passed with a majority of 480 to 159. Activists and businesses remained split over whether the parliamentary compromise meant that the EU would soon be open to other biotech crops. At present, only one is in cultivated: a variety of GM maize developed by Monsanto. Green lawmakers voted against the measure, arguing that Europe would indeed now turn to more bioengineered crops. Some also predicted that food safety authorities in Brussels would be more inclined to approve pending GM licences because of the safety net offered by individual countries being able to ban them. “I believe what this will mean in reality for the UK is more GMOs not fewer,”  Keith Taylor, a Green lawmaker. “This is because our proGM government are now able to give the goahead to more authorisations.” Britain’s stance towards GM agriculture lies in stark contrast to France and Germany, where attitudes are far more hostile. Surveys across the EU often find that consumers are worried that genespliced foods pose a risk to human health and can throw ecosystems out of kilter. “Despite a majority of EU member states and citizens being consistently opposed to GMOs, the real purpose of this new scheme is to make it easier to wave through EU authorisations of GM crops,”  Bart Staes, food safety spokesman for the Greens in the European Parliament. However, many observers rejected any suggestion that the vote would suddenly open the floodgates. Jeff Rowe from EuropaBio, the trade association representing bioindustries, called the EU’s move a “stop sign for innovation in Europe”. This is another nail in the coffin of genetically modified crop\\u2002.\\u2002.\\u2002.\\u2002this new law allows governments to shut the door on biotech crops in Europe Mute Schimpf, Friends of the Earth “Member states will receive a licence to ban safe products which have been approved at European level, and they will be allowed to base these bans on nonscientific grounds,” he added. EuropaBio called for all “23 safetyassessed products” waiting for approval by the European Commission to be approved without delay. Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group, also reckoned that the compromise would halt any advance of GM crops because of public opposition. “This is another nail in the coffin of genetically modified crops,”  Mute Schimpf, the group’s food campaigner. “While not perfect, this new law allows governments to shut the door on biotech crops in Europe and shift farming in a more sustainable direction. The public has continually rejected GM foods.”',\n",
       " 'Angola to impose quota on food, drink imports in 2015 LUANDA, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) Angola will impose a quota system on the imports of food, drinks, eggs and vegetables from the  2015 as the country was now able to produce over 60 percent of the products, the official news agency Angop reported on Tuesday. The imports would be gradually reduced and the quota would be jointly determined by executive decrees of the ministries of trade, finance, transport, industry, agriculture, fisheries and the national bank of Angola (BNA), according to recommendations presented by the first national seminar on import quotas implementation held on Monday in Luanda by the ministry of trade. The participants believed that domestic production was a priority to diversify the country oildependent economy and the import of the farming products should complement the home production deficit.

       " 'Public backlash threatens EU trade deal with the US Christian Oliver, Brussels Financial Times January 13, 2015 4:56 pm The EU has been hit by a stinging public backlash against its landmark trade deal with the US, making it increasingly unlikely that the accord will be concluded this . Brussels last  launched a public consultation to gauge popular sentiment about the most contentious part of the deal: clauses mapping out the rights of foreign investors to sue governments in international tribunals, bypassing national courts. The European Commission received almost 150,000 responses to its survey — more than 100 times more than any previous consultation on trade — and admitted on Tuesday that the majority of respondents expressed fears that the deal’s investment clauses would undermine national sovereignty. “The consultation clearly shows that there is huge scepticism against the [investment] instrument,”  Cecilia Malmström, the EU trade commissioner. The 28 EU nations want to conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership this , finalising what would be the world’s biggest trade deal. But the socalled Investment State Dispute Settlement provisions are now the biggest political obstacle to a deal, with activists arguing that they could be used to undermine national safeguards on health, food and the environment. Opposition is particularly strong in Germany, the EU’s most powerful country. Businesses argue that ISDS is vital to protecting investors against bias in national courts. Of the replies, a large number were based on copyandpaste templates circulated by nongovernmental organisations campaigning against TTIP. However, trade officials in Brussels  they would not discount these submissions as they were still a sign of discontent. Ms Malmström vowed a “frank discussion” on how to proceed with ISDS with EU states, the European Parliament, businesses and NGOs. “The European Commission would never even consider an agreement which would lower our standards or limit our governments’ right to regulate,” she added. Keith Taylor, a European parliamentarian representing the UK’s Green party,  ISDS had to be dumped. “Investors should rely on domestic courts for redress, not set up special tribunals,” he . However, ditching ISDS would be legally complex as Brussels has been mandated to negotiate it into the deal by the 28 national governments. There are also strong doubts about whether the US would support any deal without it. Instead, commission officials expect Ms Malmström to work towards a new type of ISDS framework that addresses the concerns, setting out clear rules on how international arbitrators would be appointed. While antiAmericanism is surging in Germany because of US espionage in the country, German companies have been active proponents of ISDS and the EU has 1,400 bilateral ISDS agreements. Rejecting ISDS completely would open up European countries to a charge of double standards in that they are seeking to deny US companies the same safeguards that their businesses enjoy. EU trade officials also say European businesses want to ensure ISDS remains in TTIP so that it is maintained as a standard feature for inclusion in any agreement with China.',\n",

The forecast came as a leading Opec producer  the cartel was sticking to its strategy of maintaining output and testing the mettle of highcost producers around the world. The US Energy Department  output would rise by 600,000 barrels a day this  to 9.3m b/d and by 200,000 b/d to 9.5m b/d in 2016. FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best stories from across the web The projected increase for this  is slightly lower than a previous a forecast in December, reflecting the pressure of lower crude prices on the US oil industry. “Many oil companies have cut back on their exploration drilling in response to falling crude prices and will concentrate their drilling activities in established areas that already have productive wells,” the department . The combination of technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, has unlocked America’s vast shale resources and propelled US production to around 9m b/d. The official estimates suggest the US shale industry has proved more resilient in the face of collapsing oil prices than initially feared. Although production will slow, officials  output next  will be at its highest level since 1970. However some analysts are less optimistic, predicting a major pullback in investment which will lead to production declines by the end of this . The slide in oil prices accelerated in November last  after Opec, the producers’ cartel, which pumps a third of the world’s oil, decided to keep output steady at 30m b/d, rather than cut its production to shore up prices. Speaking at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi, Suhail bin Mohammed alMazroui, the oil minister for the United Arab Emirates — a leading Gulf producer —  the cartel would not change its strategy. “We have seen oversupply coming from shale oil and that needed to be corrected,” he . Opec has shown no signs of capitulation despite poorer members of the cartel such as Venezuela voicing concern about low prices. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani  on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would also suffer from the drop in oil prices. So pessimistic are investors about the oil price that some have placed bets on US crude slumping to beyond $20 a barrel, a level last traded almost 13  ago.

This is the equivalent of 13m barrels of oil. The latest trades underscore the scale of the oil rout and the still murky outlook for the world’s staple industrial commodity. Not even at the height of the 200809 financial crisis — when much of the developed world was marred in recession — did US crude or its international counterpart Brent reach $30 a barrel. The appearance of these pessimistic wagers since the start of the  does not necessarily mean the market will reach those levels. But traders have  these bets are a lowrisk, lowcost way to bet on further falls in prices that have already dropped by almost 60 per cent since midJune. Each option costs just 7 cents. So far, these contracts are heavily “outofthemoney”, in financial parlance. with current prices more than double the $20 strike price. But even if West Texas Intermediate oil does not fall to this level, these options can increase sharply in value if oil starts dipping closer to it. ICE February Brent fell $1.54 to $45.90 in afternoon trading while Nymex February West Texas Intermediate declined 60 cents to $45.47 having briefly traded at parity with the international oil benchmark. Both markers are at the lowest since March 2009.

In September, the UN will hold a threeday gathering to agree on the Sustainable Development Goals, a 15 framework set to replace the Millennium Development Goals that expire this . The conference in New York comes only three months before policy makers descend on Paris as they seek to seal a legally binding global climate pact. The eight Millennium Development Goals, which were established in 2000 and ranged from halving extreme poverty rates to providing universal primary education, have been seen as a mixed success. While several of the targets are likely to be missed, supporters claim that progress in areas such as public health and disease control would have been impossible without them. “At the beginning of the MDGs, child mortality was addressed through a limited set of immunisation measures and malaria was off the agenda. The Millennium Development Goals were pivotal for public health,”  Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. The Sustainable Development Goals, which were first formally discussed at the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, are meant to build on the MDGs, while broadening their scope to areas such as climate change and social wellbeing. Last July, a working group of 70 countries agreed to a list of 17 goals, including 169 targets ranging from eradicating extreme poverty to promoting sustainable tourism. But critics fear the list is too long to ensure the targets are implemented. And since many of the aims remain impossible to measure, it will be hard to hold governments accountable for any promises they commit to. The sustainable development goals are too many, too fuzzy and cannot be measured, so we have a problem. Every country insisted their issue was included in the agenda Jan Vandemoortele, development economist “The sustainable development goals are too many, too fuzzy and cannot be measured, so we have a problem,”  Jan Vandemoortele, a development economist who helped to design the MDGs. “Every country insisted their issue was included in the agenda,” he added. Representatives approached the negotiations with “a salesperson mindset”. Campaigners, who include celebrities such as U2 lead singer Bono and Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, argue that the SDGs still provide a useful framework to increase awareness over sustainable development and foster policy action. “The critical elements of [the SDGs] are ambition, implementability, focus and a strong emphasis on tackling inequality. The current draft is still a long way from that but a lot of the building blocks are there and we’re confident with the right political engagement this is eminently achievable,”  Brendan Cox, director of policy at Save the Children, one of the charities taking part in the Action/2015 campaign. The success of the SDGs will also hinge on ensuring there is adequate financing for the policies needed to implement the targets.

Yemen ranks last with only two percent of management posts held by women. \"As documented in the report, evidencebased public policy design and gendersmart private sector practices can make a big difference in leveling the playing field for women in management,\"  Henriette Kolb, head of the Gender Secretariat at the International Financial Corporation, a part of the World Bank Group. For example, she noted that in the case of the Dominican Republic, firmlevel gender certification programs were established. The United States takes 15th place on the list with women representing just over 40 percent of all managers, while Britain is number 41 (34.2 percent) among the 108 countries examined by the report. However, the UK is among the four countries, including Sweden, Norway and Finland, where women hold over 20 percent of board seats. Portugal, India and the United Arab Emirates are among the worst performers with less than five percent of board positions held by women. There are more women in paid employment than ever before and their growing presence in the job market has been the biggest engine of global growth and competitiveness, the ILO . According to several studies examined by the ILO, companies with more women in top roles tend to perform better, but the organisation was cautious in establishing a direct causal link. Women hold over 40 percent of jobs globally. They own and run 30 percent of the world businesses, but female leadership tends to be more common in small enterprises. Despite significant strides, experts remain cautious in declaring that the socalled \"glass ceiling\" has been shattered. \"There is a long way to go before we achieve true gender equality in the workplace, especially when it comes to top management positions,\"  Deborah FranceMassin, director of the ILO Bureau for Employers\\' Activities. \"\\'Glass walls\\' still exist with the concentration of women in certain types of management functions like human resources, communications and administration.\" END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'WTO chief says India should lead talks on food stock solution Nayanima Basu Business Standard 16 January 2015 India should assume a leading role in spearheading the talks for having a permanent solution in public stockholding for food security purposes, according to the director general of World Trade Organization (WTO) Roberto Azevedo. The first decision and clearly the most  for India was a clarification of the Bali decision on the public stockholding for food security purposes mainly and unequivocally stating that the Peace Clause agreed in Bali would remain in place until a permanent solution is found for that issue. I look forward to India playing a leading role in this regard in the coming months, Azevedo  on Friday while addressing the CII Partnership Summit. Lauding the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and minister of state (independent charge) for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman in achieving the breakthrough last  in November that led to the adoption of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), Azevedo  it was significant decision that enabled all 160members agree to come together and bring issues back on track. Azevedo  the impasse that was reached in the talks that were agreed in Bali, had a paralyzing effect on negotiations across the board. The standoff happened last  in July when India refused to sign the TFA that would have converted it into a legal document. TFA aims at easing global customs norms. India took a stance that it will not agree to the TFA until the Peace Clause on food stocks is made permanent until a final solution is arrived at on the issue. Earlier, it was agreed in Bali in December 2013 that the Peace Clause or interim measure will be applicable only for four . However, the impasse was broken when US assured its support on Indias stance at the WTO. Subsequently all members also agreed. Azevedo  WTO members are now working towards ratifying the TFA according to their own domestic procedures. It has the potential to make a big difference, particularly for countries like India, he added. Underscoring the need for members to put their focus back on the Doha Development Agenda, which started in 2001, Azevdo  that all countries should start negotiations by July. He also highlighted the tough times expected ahead with the onset of negotiations that will culminate at the 10th ministerial conference in Nairobi in December. On the other hand, minister Sitharaman once again stated that mercantilist policies of certain countries cannot be encourage if the Doha development round has to be completed. There is an attempt to link free trade to development. Trade and development are intertwined but I would be hastened to think that only trade is development Development must remain at the core of the Doha round, Sitharaman added. She also highlighted that the objective of the Doha round is alleviating poverty, which cannot be done if the agreements are achieved based on countries growth rates.',\n",

It should continue to stand up to protectionism\", Sitharaman  at a special Plenary at the CII Partnership Summit 2015 at Jaipur on Friday. This special plenary was held to mark the two decades of existence of the WTO. Starting on January 1, 1995 with 127 members, the WTO has significantly expanded in the two decades of its existence with as many as 160 members and accounting for 98 percent of the global trade. In her address, Sitharaman urged the WTO to be more responsive to the needs of the developing countries and least developed countries, who account for minuscule share of less than 1 per cent of the global trade. INDIA CONCERN Sitharaman also expressed concern about attempts being made by certain countries to equate only free trade to development. \"Trade is an  instrument (for development). But only free trade cannot be equated to development. Development encompasses of other things also and not just trade\", Sitharaman . Development was at the core of the Doha Development Agenda and it must remain at the centrestage, she , noting that WTO future work programme must factor in the point that prosperity of few cannot be achieved at the misery of many. Later, WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told BusinessLine that he agreed with the India position that trade cannot be the only element affecting development of countries. \"She (Nirmala Sitharaman) is absolutely right. Trade is not the only element affecting development, there are many elements that affects the development of countries. It would also be wrong to say that trade does not play a part. While trade is not the only element that must be looked into, it is clearly one  element of the development debate\", Azevedo . He also made it clear that it was not for the WTO (the organisation) but its members who have to find the right balance.',\n",
       " 'WTO rules against Argentina in import restrictions case By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) The World Trade Organization on Thursday rejected Argentina bid to overturn a ruling in favor of the United States, the European Union and Japan against the South American country licensing rules used to restrict imports. The WTO appellate body recommended Argentina fix its trade rules after it upheld an earlier WTO panel report that Argentina import licensing requirement and other import restrictions breach international trade rules. Reacting to the decision, Argentina  it would have no immediate impact on trade. \"It will not have an immediate practical impact on the system and administration of commerce or on trade dynamics,\" Commerce Secretary Augusto Costa told Reuters. Faced with a struggling economy, Argentina government has limited imports in a bid to shield local industries and bolster its trade surplus. In 2012, the country imposed a system requiring prior approval of nearly every purchase from abroad, sparking the WTO case. The U.S. National Association of Manufacturers  Argentina should quickly scrap its \"burdensome\" import requirements and the administration  it would continue to make sure trading partners played fair. \"Argentina protectionist measures impact a broad segment of U.S. exports, potentially affecting billions of dollars in U.S. exports each  that support highquality, middleclass American jobs,\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in a statement. The European Commission  Argentina should stop requiring foreign companies to limit their imports, offset the value of imports with equivalent exports, invest in the country and keep their profits there, or use a certain amount of Argentine content in their products. A U.S. trade official  as a result of the ruling, Argentina would have a \"number of months\" to fix its laws and make sure any import licenses were automatic and transparent. But so far no deadline has been set and presidential elections in October mean the issue could wait for the next government. Argentina, Latin America No. 3 economy, is also locked in a dispute with U.S. investors over unpaid debt. Ultimately, if the dispute cannot be resolved, trading partners could retaliate by restricting Argentine imports or seek financial compensation. The United States exported nearly $11 billion in goods to Argentina in the 11 months through last November, according to trade data. Key exports were computers, industrial and agricultural chemicals, agricultural and transportation equipment, machine tools, parts for oil field rigs, and refined fuel oil. European exports to the country, mainly machinery, transport equipment and chemicals, totaled 10 billion euros ($11.59 billion) in 2013, trade data showed.

       " 'Lawmakers hail victory on Argentina imports By Victoria Guida POLITICO 1/15/15 5:45 PM EST Members of Congress praised the United States sound defeat of Argentina at the World Trade Organization on Thursday over the Latin American countrys import restrictions, with House Ways and Means ranking member Sander Levin calling them discriminatory and obnoxious. Argentinas import licensing restrictions are particularly pernicious because they apply to imports of all goods into Argentina, clearly discriminate against nonArgentine producers, and unjustifiably force companies seeking access to Argentinas market to make local investments and purchases in a manner that amounts to extortion, Levin  in a statement. Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden stressed that strong enforcement of trade rules delivers clear wins for American workers, manufacturers and businesses that export. The WTO confirmed that Argentinas illegal trade restrictions on American exports of everything from advanced electronics to bicycles have no place in a 21st century global trading system, he  in a statement, calling Argentinas restrictions a protectionist shakedown of American exporters. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative particularly stressed their recent record of enforcement victories, including challenges of Chinas duties on autos, export restrictions on rare earth minerals and Indias ban on U.S. poultry. One administration official hammered this point home, telling POLITICO: This administrations commitment to enforcement is evident in victories like this one and will absolutely be part of the overall case we make on moving the trade agenda forward. The National Association of Manufacturers similarly praised the ruling, saying it would promote a more open trading environment that will expand opportunities for both our economies. Manufacturers strongly welcome todays decision by the WTO Appellate Body finding that Argentinas burdensome and tradelimiting import licensing requirements are contrary to the obligations that Argentina took in joining the WTO, Linda Dempsey, NAMs vice president of international economic affairs,  in a statement. We urge Argentina to move quickly to eliminate these provisions. The WTOs Appellate Body shot down all of Argentinas appeals in a dispute with the United States, European Union and Japan over a broad array of import restrictions. The ruling upheld a WTO panels previous decision that the countrys Advance Sworn Import Declaration violated international trade rules barring import restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges. The WTO faulted Argentina for conditioning a companys imports on an equal or greater value of exports, limiting the volume of imports or reducing their price, requiring investment in Argentina and mandating local content in domestic goods. This is a great win for the United States, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in a press release. Argentinas protectionist measures impact a broad segment of U.S. exports, potentially affecting billions of dollars in U.S. exports each  that support highquality, middleclass American jobs. Argentinas import policy also allowed the country to require extra information or steps from importers before their products were allowed into the country. Opponents of the policy argued that this amounted to an import license that could be faulted under the WTOs import licensing agreement, but the original WTO panel disagreed, calling it a restriction. After the U.S., EU and Japan began dispute settlement action on this case in 2012, Buenos Aires responded by launching its own WTO cases, including one against EU restrictions on imports of biodiesel and two against U.S. curbs on imports of lemon and beef. According to a U.S. trade official, the lemon case is still under discussion by the two sides. A WTO panel is expected to issue a ruling in the beef case early this .',\n",

Korea wants China to add products such as rechargeable batteries or certain kinds of monitors to the product list to make up for the fact that China has been unwilling to consider tariff elimination on flatpanel displays. One informed source  Chinese and Korean ministers have exchanged letters on ITA, but Beijing has not wavered from its insistence that it cannot make concessions that go beyond the understanding it reached with the United States in November.

       " 'Vilsack Says Congress Will Need Act On COOL If U.S. Loses WTO Appeal Inside U.S. Trade 01/16/2015 Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack last week suggested that Congress would have to either repeal or reform the U.S. countryoforigin labeling (COOL) system for meat if the United States loses its appeal at the World Trade Organization of an October 2014 panel ruling that found the U.S. failed to bring its COOL regime into compliance with trade rules. Speaking on Jan. 9, Vilsack also pointed to two ways that Congress could fix the law if the U.S. appeals fail. They are to repeal the mandatory COOL requirement, thereby making such labeling voluntary, or to come up with a more lax labeling regime that does not require cattle producers to segregate animals based on their country of origin. \"If we lose the appeal, the only way you can create a synergy between what Congress is currently asking us to do and the WTO is for Congress either to rescind and repeal the law, and you get into a voluntary situation, or come up with a different direction to us to come up with a more generic labeling that doesn\\'t require segregation,\" Vilsack  during a press conference at the American Farm Bureau Federation annual convention in San Diego. In its October ruling, the compliance panel found that the COOL measure despite revisions made through a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule in 2013 to comply with an earlier WTO Appellate Body ruling continued to violate Article 2.1 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which requires that members\\' technical regulations not discriminate against imported products. The U.S. appealed the compliance panel ruling on Nov. 28, and the Appellate Body is required to deliver its ruling within 6090 days of that date. Vilsack statement at the Farm Bureau convention goes farther than remarks he made in November saying he does not believe COOL can be sufficiently altered through regulation to satisfy the WTO (Inside U.S. Trade, Nov. 21, 2014). At the Farm Bureau press conference, Vilsack emphasized that his aides have told him USDA cannot \"square the circle\" through more COOL regulations. The Farm Bureau in its 2015 policy positions adopted on Jan. 13  it supports COOL provisions \"consistent with World Trade Organization rules.\" That position does not go beyond what the Farm Bureau has  previously.',\n",

The U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce on Thursday announced regulatory amendments to sanctions on Cuba following the U.S. president announcement of a set of diplomatic and economic changes to chart a new course in U.S. relations with Cuba in December 2014. The new changes will facilitate travel to Cuba, allow U.S. financial institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions to facilitate the transactions processing, change export policy and authorize the flow of certain goods and services to Cuba with a license, and allow a number of activities, such as telecommunications, financial services, and shipping.

       " 'Swiss stun markets and scrap franc ceiling James Shotter in Zurich, Alice Ross in Washington and Michael Hunter in London Financial Times Last updated:January 15, 2015 7:54 pm Switzerlands central bank stunned markets in one of the most dramatic currency interventions in decades as it unexpectedly abandoned a ceiling put in place more than three  ago, sending the franc soaring against the euro. The Swiss currency surged as much as 39 per cent against both the euro and the dollar, one of the sharpest appreciations in recent history, after the Swiss National Bank  it would no longer maintain its SFr1.20 threshold. The decision was not taken as part of a coordinated policy with other central banks,  a person with knowledge of the situation. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund,  she found it a bit surprising that the SNB had not warned her of the move. The European Central Bank is next week expected to embark on a sovereign bond buying programme aimed at reviving growth and saving the eurozone from the ravages of deflation. A launch of fullblown quantitative easing would precipitate massive demand for the Swiss franc, widely seen as one of global markets stronger havens and would have made it increasingly difficult for the SNB to defend its currency ceiling. The move triggered mayhem on foreign exchange trading desks and sent investors who had been betting on the ceiling remaining scrambling to close positions. Anyone caught on the wrong side of this will be lying on the floor,  one hedge fund manager. The post2008 period of excessive reliance on central bank policies needs to give way to a more comprehensive policy response There was a degree of shock and an equal amount of horror,  a banker on a London trading floor after the news broke at 10.30am European time. In late trade, the euro was down 13.8 per cent at SFr1.0355. The ceiling was introduced in 2011 after the eurozone debt crisis saw investors pile into Swiss assets as a perceived haven, strengthening the franc and alarming central bank officials who wanted to protect exporters. Yet the SNB has increasingly faced questions over its bloated balance sheet as its attempts to keep the franc weak resulted in a record pile up of SFr495bn in foreign currencies about 80 per cent of Swiss gross domestic product. The decision highlights the difficulties that central banks of smaller developed economies, such as Switzerland and the UK, face as they navigate the turbulent waters between the US Federal Reserve, which is closer to tightening monetary policy, and the ECB, which is poised to loosen it. It also marks a volteface for the SNB, which insisted on Monday that it remained committed to the ceiling. Thomas Jordan, chairman of the SNBs governing board, defended the decision, saying that once it was clear that the policy was no longer sustainable, it was  to act quickly. The banks move was greeted with dismay by Switzerlands exporters, as a stronger franc will make their products more expensive abroad . The countrys main equities index, the SMI, fell 10 per cent on the banks announcement. Todays SNB action is a tsunami; for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country,  Nick Hayek, chief executive of Swatch Group, the watchmaker. Its shares tumbled 16.4 per cent to SFr382.30. Bank shares also declined. UBS fell 11.7 per cent to SFr14.73, Credit Suisse was 11 per cent weaker at SFr20.66, and Julius Baer fell 11.5 per cent to SFr40.40. The move hit eastern European economies currencies, with the Polish zloty initially down 40 per cent to the franc.',\n",
       " 'IMF Chief Says Global Economy Faces \\'Very Strong\\' Headwinds By Ian Talley 15 January 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News Strong headwinds from weak investment, substantial debt burdens and high unemployment are preventing a pickup in global economic growth despite a strengthening U.S. recovery and tumbling oil prices, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde . A healthier U.S. and cheaper energy \"won\\'t suffice to actually accelerate the growth or the potential for growth in the rest of the world,\" the head of the emergency lender to nations  in a speech Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. \"If the global economy is weak, on its knees, it not going to help,\"  Ms. Lagarde in remarks previewing the IMF latest forecasts for the global economy due out on Monday. The eurozone, at risk of a third recession in six , continues to struggle with the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis. Japan is also mired in low inflation, high debt and anemic growth. And output in many major emerging marketseconomies that have provided most of the gas for global growth over the last decadeis slowing faster than expected. Nonetheless, the IMF is upgrading its forecast for economic output in the U.S., one of the few advanced economies bucking the weak globalgrowth trend. But the world biggest economy and a shot in the arm from cheaper gasoline aren\\'t cures for deepseated weakness elsewhere, Ms. Lagarde . \"Too many companies and households keep cutting back on investment and consumption today because they are concerned about growth tomorrow,\" she . Both Europe and Japan are at risk from a much longer period of excessively low inflation and anemic growth, the former French finance minister . Years of stagnation in two of the world biggest economies also threaten to drag down global growth. That would make it even harder for those economies to cut their dangerously high debt levels and raise employment, two persistent legacies of the financial crisis. The Bank of Japan has expanded its cash injections to help spur growth, while European Central Bank officials have signaled plans for a new bondbuying program that could be announced as soon as next week. Meanwhile, markets are expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve this  to raise borrowing rates for first time since 2006. The schism between interest rates moving in different directions around the globe is one of the major reasons the dollar has hit decadelong highs in recent weeks against a basket of currencies. Ms. Lagarde  the Fed expected mid rate increase will likely fuel further strong swings in international capital flows, exchange rates, bond prices and stock markets. Many emerging markets are increasingly exposed to turmoil elsewhere, especially those with high dollardenominated debt. As those countries\\' currency values fall and their growth prospects dim, investors are rethinking their highrisk investments. \"Among those emerging markets, some are likely to face a triple risk\" from a stronger U.S. dollar, higher global interest rates and volatile capital flows, the IMF head . Ms. Lagarde also  oil price fall should, on balance, boost global growth, as consumers have more money left over after filling their car tanks to spend in other sectors of the economy. But she acknowledged the decline is also adding to deflation risks in Europe and Japan, bolstering the case for central bank action. The high risk of recessions and  of slow global growth are why policy makers need to take more aggressive action, she . Aside from pushing for a longer period of easymoney policies and more infrastructure investment, the IMF has been urging the Group of 20 largest economies to honor promises for economic overhauls to reignite growth prospects. \"Policy makers have to step up structural reforms. There a lot of talk about it, and some are doing it, but there has to be real implementation, \" she . \"All of that is not new, but it takes a sense of increased urgency.\" In many countries, efforts to restructure labor and product markets, overhaul education, health, and social safety nets, or approve trade deals that would open up protected markets have faced stiff political hurdles. Some economists fear the longer growth remains weak, the more politically difficult those economic policy changes may become. END ________________________________',\n",

Since 1995, the WTO has welcomed 33 new members including large economies like China and Russia and its 160 members represent 98 per cent of world trade. It has addressed some 500 trade disputes between members while keeping protectionist measures at bay. India Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman,  the WTO should continue its good work in stemming protectionism and urged the WTO to be more responsive to the needs of developing and leastdeveloped countries. Sitharaman also highlighted her concern that some countries have started to equate only free trade with development.',\n",
       " 'WTO trade deal: India to scuttle inclusion of new issues Asit Ranjan Mishra Mint Jaipur, Jan. 16 Ahead of the July 2015 deadline to finalize the work programme for the postBali multilateral trade negotiations, India on Friday indicated that it would scuttle any attempt to include new issues in the multilateral trade negotiations. The government made its point as World Trade Organization (WTO) director general Roberto Azevedo sought to assure India that there was no attempt to move away from the mandate of the Doha Development Agenda. Trade minister Nirmala Sitharaman  it was troubling to hear suggestions that development was no longer relevant in debates about multilateral trade. \"These voices urge to move on and start the new century with new issues which it is promised will take all developing countries towards development and progress,\" she  at the Partnership Summit organized in Jaipur by the Confederation of India Industry (CII). \"That is very disconcerting and I would think we have to be sure not to go in that direction for getting what the Doha Development Agenda is known for,\"she added Sitharaman  there was an attempt to equate free trade with development. \"Only free trade cannot mean development. Prosperity of a few cannot be achieved over the misery of many. Fulfilling what has been promised at the Doha Development Agenda should be taken up wholeheartedly by the WTO,\" she added. After the US and India resolved their differences over public stockholding for food security in November and the trade facilitation agreement (TFA) was given the goahead, there has been renewed interest in multilateral trade negotiations. At the same event on Friday, Azevedo  WTO members had agreed that work for the postBali work programme will resume immediately and that they will engage constructively on the implementation of all decisions taken at Bali, Indonesia, in 2013. \"This means taking forward the Bali decisions on agriculturecotton included, creating a monetary mechanism to look at how special and differential provisions for developing countries are being implemented and decisions on least developed countries issues related to dutyfree, quotafree services and rules of origin. So it is vital that we use this momentum that we have now to take these decisions forward with the priority that they deserve,\" he . Azevedo  the big and tough issues of agriculture, services and industrial goods will be back at the negotiating table. \"So I urge you all to be prepared and to engage proactively in this work. We must succeed in these efforts,\" he added. To fasttrack discussions on the postBali agenda, Azevedo has invited all WTO ambassadors of member countries on 21 January to chart the way ahead, a commerce ministry official  on condition of anonymity. \"Doha Development Agenda has a mandate. I don\\'t think anybody now is going to change the mandate. Members can take up any issue any time, but not under the Doha Development Agenda. I don\\'t think there is any attempt or desire to change the mandate at this point of time,\" Azevedo . On Sitharaman comment on free trade and development, Azevedo : \"We have to recognise that there are many elements that affect development of countries, but it would also be wrong to say that trade does not take a part. So though trade is not the only element that must be looked into, it is clearly one very  component of the development issue.\"',\n",

In his daily message to the press at the government house, the chief of ministers today considered possible to establish bilateral negotiation criteria with the complaining countries United States, Japan and the European Union , but not without carrying out first an analysis of the context, considering the financial crisis is still hitting hard on the global economy. On Thursday, the WTO rejected Argentina bid to overturn a ruling in favour of the US, the EU and Japan in a case against national licensing rules that the international body  have been used to unlawfully restrict imports. Furthermore, the cabinet chief blasted media operations that report an alleged lack of certain goods and supplies, something he blamed companies\\' lack of planning or speculative actions for. Shortfall of certain goods or supplies, he affirmed, is not a matter of restriction or import authorizations. Argentina is within the first ten countries that have increased imports the most over the past eleven , the ex governor of the Chaco province  stressing that the nations now battling against Buenos Aires at the WTO are those that receive complaints the most due to their own trade practices. Speculative attacks and foreign currency wars distort growth perspectives of the world economy and trade, the head of ministers continued, denouncing a structural crisis of the financial system that began in 2008 prompting severe consequences since then. Except for 2009, in 2014 the lowest rate of global GDP growth was registered, with 1.8 percent, while in Latin American it was of 1 percent, the official explained saying such scenario led to difficulties in the financing of global trade.',\n",
       " 'European Parliament is gearing up for TISA 16 January 2015 EurActiv.com Overshadowed by the highly mediatised Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) negotiations are moving along, and will appear on the radar this , promises Luxembourgish MEP Viviane Reding, responsible for the dossier. You will hear a lot about TISA in 2015, she  speaking to journalists this week in Strasbourg. Parliament will present a report in the fall of this , after consulting stakeholders, she added. Fairly unnoticed, the Council authorised the Commission to engage in negotiations in March 2013. Since then, there have been 10 negotiating rounds. The next round will take place in February. Initiated by the United States and Australia, TISA seeks to further liberalise trade in service and upgrading the current GATS, which saw the day in the preInternet era. Lessons learned TISA is a chance to make Europe both more competitive and protective, Reding , stressing that the EU intends to break new grounds in both market access commitments and international rules, while defending its standards and interest. This is why the agreement excludes sensitive areas like intellectual property rights and ISDS. We want to avoid an ACTA bis and TTIP bis, she explained. Audiovisual sector and public services like water, health and education are also excluded. These are not for sale, she insisted. Well aware that freedom of movement and fundamental rights have derailed negotiations in the past with the socalled Bolkenstein directive and Prism, Reding stated that she will strive to take those out of the talks. According to EU officials, the most promising sectors to be included in the deal are telecoms, ecommerce, financial services, postal services, maritime, road and air transport, professional services and public procurement. TISA must bring tangible benefits to EU citizens both when they travel abroad (roaming charges and passengers rights) and when they do online shopping or online banking, Reding argued. The agreement, which is being negotiated in a way that will allow parties to choose which sectors will be liberalised, could pose a question for the future, experts . Pick and choose This la carte system that features a \"positive list\" approach for scheduling market access commitments would create a de facto exclusion of any services that have \"yet to be conceived\" because those sectors could not be specifically listed at the time of negotiation, experts reportedly told a trade publication. The services sector is the world largest employer, and produces 70% of global gross domestic product (GDP). Altogether, negotiating partners represent a third of WTO members, and 68% of global trade in services. TISA covers 23 countries, including Canada, Chile, Taiwan, Colombia, Costa Rica, the European Union, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Turkey. European Parliament experts concede that TISA is the most promising opportunity in two decades to improve and expand trade in services. The negotiations are also meant to advance where the multilateral Doha round has failed. So far however none of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and SouthAfrica) have taken part in the negotiations, even though China has asked to join. But the United States and Japan oppose the involvement of Beijing. Parliament insists that TISA has to be compatible with GATS, as it will allow other WTO members who want to join to do so at a later stage.',\n",

He was speaking at the Partnership Summit which is being organised by the Confederation of India Industry (CII) in cooperation with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Government of Rajasthan in Jaipur. Kher noted that most developing countries are not in a position to affiliate to these rules, however, there is a huge trade and economic reforms agenda in India that can be guided by the rules being negotiated in the TPP. He also stated that India participation in the negotiations of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) comes out from the recognition that Asia as a manufacturing hub in the world would be crucial for India aspirations of achieving greater linkages in the manufacturing and services value chains. Trade ministers from Australia and Malaysia two countries that are part of both the TPP and RCEP negotiations, also noted the lower level of ambition of the RCEP as compared to TPP. Andrew Robb, Minister of Trade and Investment, Australia  that when TPP and RCEP regions come together the benefits of seamless regulations can be shared across the whole region. Mr. Mohamed, Minister of International Trade and Industry, Malaysia  that the TPP will lead to greater value chain integration while expressing concerns that the country had over some issues like stateowned enterprises, investorstate dispute settlement and loss of sovereignty on some nontrade areas. Global value chains (GVCs) have revolutionised not just international commerce but also trade policy making. Making this point, Harsha Vardhana Singh, former DDG of the WTO,  that megaregionals are an indication of the change that is taking place in the world and the upgradation taking place much faster than expected. Due to the tradeinvestmentservicesGVCstechnology nexus, higher standards will be incorporated into the megaregional framework, including the everchanging private standards. Giving an instance of the IT sector, he  that as soon as privacy and data transfer standards are upgraded India competitiveness in the sector could be eroded, unless adequate reforms in the services sector are not put in place. Later, Ms. Gao Yan, Vice Minister of Commerce, China,  that while China is getting used to the 'new normal' of lower growth and higher reforms, standards are being constantly upgraded to reflect innovation driven growth. China attaches great importance to the TPP and TTIP negotiations and are open towards joining both megaregionals, she . Both China and India are part of the RCEP, one of the most  regional agreements in Asia, and China looks to work constructively with India towards conclusion of the agreement, she . Earlier, Mr. Sunil Kant Munjal, Chairman, Hero Corporate Services Ltd.,  that India needs to keep a realistic eye on the WTOplus regimes that have emerged due to the impasse in the WTO Doha Round and the changing reality of how trade and investments are conducted across the world. He  that through the RCEP, India has the opportunity to proactively engage in the megaregional rulemaking exercise, while preparations need to begin for the kind of changes that will be required to equip the policy framework and business capability to work in a 'high standard' world trading system. The US and EU began negotiations on the TTIP in 2013, and negotiations between the US and eleven other nations across the Pacific are at an advanced stage under the TPP with a growing membership each . It is interesting to note that none of the large emerging economies, including India, Brazil and China are part of the UScentric megaregionals. Instead, India and China are part of the ASEANled Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that was launched among the ASEAN members and its FTA partners towards the end of 2012.\",\n",

In his new  address, Azevedo : \"Over the past 20 , this organization has, on balance, made an  contribution to the global economy and to smoother trading relations between nations. Indeed, at a time when the global economy is more interconnected than ever it is difficult to imagine a world without the WTO. \"So as we look to the  ahead there is a lot of work to do and many challenges to meet. While we have delivered in many areas, and despite the success of Bali, the pace of negotiations remains a source of frustration. \"In future we know that we need to deliver more outcomes, more quickly. In addition, we know that our poorest members are still not adequately integrated into the trading system, so again we need to do more to help them reap the benefits that the system can offer. \"Moreover, we will be working to implement all aspects of the Bali package and we already have a full negotiating agenda including a deadline of July to conclude a detailed road map to tackle the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda. We will also be seeking to make progress in negotiations on trade in environmental goods and on an agreement to remove tariffs on a wide range of information technology products. \"Success in each of these areas would be the best way to mark our 20th anniversary and to reaffirm the contribution that the WTO has made to improving people lives and prospects over the last two decades. \"Our organization has evolved since 1995. We have welcomed 33 new members, ranging from some of world largest economies to some of the least developed. Today our 160 members account for approximately 98% of global trade. Moreover, at our 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we took our first major step forward in updating multilateral trade rules. \"The measures agreed in Bali were a real breakthrough for the WTO, and they will provide a significant economic boost. In December 2014 WTO Members came together to recommit to implementing all aspects of the Bali package\".

The U.S. president will arrive in New Delhi on Jan. 25 and hold discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited Washington in September. An official agenda has not been released. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) listed three India companies as having commercial activity in Irans energy sector in a report this week, potentially making it difficult for them to do business with other countries, mainly the United States. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), Oil India Ltd (OILI.NS) and India Oil Corp (IOC.NS), which have been on the list since 2010, cited interests in Irans Farsi concession in their 201314 annual reports but told the GAO they had ceased activity in 2007, the GAO . This (mention in the list) could hit India companies plans to invest in other countries, particularly in America,  one of the sources. The United States has imposed sanctions on Irans energy sector to put pressure on the Islamic republic to halt its nuclear programme, which the West suspects may seek to develop atomic weapons. Companies doing business in the sector face exclusion from the U.S. financial system. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. Separately, Oil Ministry sources  India will seek preferential access to U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), even though India does not have a freetrade agreement (FTA) with the United States.

United States Trade Representative Michael Froman made the USTR position available on its official website, in response to Bangladesh last update, sent in midNovember in 2014, on progress made in line with the USdesigned Action Plan. Washington revoked trade benefits for Bangladesh in mid2013 following tragedies in the Rana Plaza building collapse and Tazreen Fashions factory fire. More than 1,200 people were killed. The USTR review found that under government oversight more than 2,000 safety reviews of factories had been carried out in the last , most by teams organised by privatesector initiatives led by North American and European brands and retailers, resulting in the closure or partial closure of 48 plants. The government of Bangladesh is responsible for inspection of several hundred more factories, the trade representative pointed out in regretting US inability to restore the trade facility for now. \"We urge the government to complete remaining factory inspections as soon as possible to prevent recurrence of workplace tragedies such as those that occurred in 2012 and 2013,\" Mr Froman . \"There is more work to do, building on the collaboration between the government of Bangladesh, privatesector stakeholders, and the International Labor Organization, to address the concerns about factory safety in the apparel sector,\" he added.

Suspending trade benefits did not directly hit Bangladesh multibilliondollar clothing exports but it put pressure on the country and many of the world largest garment and fashion companies, which sourced clothes from Bangladesh manufacturers. In 2012, the total value of US imports from Bangladesh under GSP was $34.7 million. The top GSP imports from Bangladesh included tobacco, sports equipment, porcelain china, and plastic products.

On Thursday, the WTO rejected Argentina bid to overturn a ruling in favour of the US, the EU and Japan in a case against national licensing rules that the international body  have been used to unlawfully restrict imports. The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling against Argentina triggers “no immediate modification” of the country trade administration, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich pointed out adding a “comprehensive and detailed analysis of the ruling terms” is needed. Capitanich added that an analysis of the economic repercussions was still required, considering the financial crisis is still hitting hard on the global economy. Furthermore, the cabinet chief blasted “media operations” that report an “alleged lack of certain goods and supplies,” something he blamed “companies' lack of planning or speculative actions” for. Shortage of certain goods or supplies, he affirmed, is not a matter of restriction or import authorizations. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner policy of controlling imports to shield local industries and bolster trade surplus could be affected severely by the ruling, but its implementation will not be immediate, with delays over implementation periods, negotiations between the countries and disputes over the reach of the decision likely to occur. Even though the Domestic Trade Secretariat had been previously restricting some imports through resolutions and informal agreements with importers, the conflict with trading partners escalated in 2012 when Argentina imposed a system requiring prior approval of nearly every purchase from abroad, sparking the WTO case. The DJAI import permits were at the heart of the US, EU and Japan cases, and the WTO also saw them as central in its ruling, although other control mechanisms were also mentioned. Japan had also complained about lengthy delays in authorizing DJAI permits before imports could go through, in similar fashion to local importers, who have sparked public clashes with government officials lately. As a result, the government agreed this week to create an online system that would allow importers to automatize the approval of these permits, looking to ease the process, which today deals with 8,000 permits per day. Changes in the nature of the system could also be used by the government to argue that sanctions should not apply.\",\n",

Taiwan would be a tricky one for the US government, so I dont see any dramatic move in that direction, Asian Development Bank executive director Robert Orr told a conference this week. Its always a touchy issue for us in terms of our relationship with China, and in my estimation it wont be coming any time in the near term, Orr added. Victor Cha, director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University,  China would be a factor. Speaking very plainly, in terms of rounding out TPP, the brass ring is China, thus its going to be hard to have a conversation about Taiwan, Cha . However, Cha  that Taiwan had worked very hard to bring itself to the table in all sorts of different international institutions and you cant rule anything out. If in the long term TPP has a sort of transformational effect on not just the economic, but also the strategic picture, and if the crossstrait relationship continues to improve, you dont know whats possible in the future, he . Organized by the Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) and the Asian Studies Program at Georgetown University, the conference was focused on negotiating growth in Asia. The proposed TPP agreement between the US, Japan and 10 other countries is not yet complete, and Taiwan hopes to join it as part of a second group of countries after the initial deal is reached. Representative to the US Shen Lyushun says that membership is a must for the next stage of Taiwans national development. The countries currently involved in TPP talks account for about 40 percent of global economic output and more than a third of world trade. Shen has told Washington reporters that joining the pact is vital for Taiwan to keep up with increasingly tough competition. An academic paper on crossstrait relations published by the CSIS this week says that Taiwan continues to be effectively excluded from regional trade regimes such as the TPP and bilateral trade liberalization agreements. Written by David Brown, a Johns Hopkins University professor of China studies, and Kevin Scott, an associate director of Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, the paper says that in October last , thenminister of economic affairs Woody Duh  several other countries were willing to hold substantive trade negotiations with Taiwan, but that talks had not begun due to interference from China. The hesitant countries are believed to be India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia and perhaps Australia, the paper says. It says that the governments inability to sign highprofile freetrade agreements (FTAs) has seemed like a slow motion crisis for Taiwan and that the risk of marginalization became more urgent when China and South Korea announced the conclusion of substantive negotiations on a bilateral FTA. While committed to its peaceful development policy, Beijing will have  tactical decisions to make about what can be accomplished in the remaining months of [President] Ma Yingjeous [] presidency and on how it can position itself most effectively to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, the paper says.',\n",

That hurts them by cutting their competitive advantage, he . Some trade partners also had nontariff barriers to help protect their domestic industries, which was another major problem that prevented Thai companies from taking advantage of FTAs. \"It a crucial problem that the government will have to tackle immediately by completing more campaigns to let Thai firms realise those FTA privileges and encourage them to understand and use them to greater benefit,\" Mr Vallop . ________________________________',\n",
       " 'Egypt finishes first meeting with African ministers over unified WTO stances 19 January 2015 Egypt Independent Egypt wrapped up on Sunday a first meeting with a number of African trade ministers over talks related to unifying African positions in negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over various issues, including subsidization, development, trade liberalization and storage of food commodities. The meeting, chaired by Trade and Industry Minister Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour, was attended by WTO director Roberto Azevdo, as well as the trade ministers of Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. Abdel Nour  that besides discussing the WTOs 2015 agenda, the ministers agreed upon the multiparty trade system as the best propeller of economic development, also reiterating on the development agenda agreed in the 2001 WTO ministerial meeting in Doha as the axis of the organizations operations. The meeting also discussed the African states position in light of the latest WTO round of meetings in Bali, Indonesia, with an emphasis on the need for an action plan to implement recommendations made during the two rounds in Doha and Bali.',\n",
       " 'European Parliament Lays Out TISA Demands, Including China Participation Posted: January 16, 2015 World Trade Online The European Parliament rapporteur on the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) has laid out t10 demands that must be met for a final agreement to be acceptable to its members, including having China participate in the negotiations now taking place among selected members of the World Trade Organization. \"China will certainly become one of the main trading partners in services,\"  Viviane Reding, the parliament TISA rapporteur and a member of the European People Party in a Jan. 13 press conference. \"It will be very  to have China on board and I think there is a general agreement in Europe that China should be granted access if it so wants to the negotiation table.\" She  that as negotiations advance, other emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa will join. The European Commission formally backed China membership in March 2014, but has been met with pushback from the United States. The U.S. opposes including China in TISA with the argument that China has not shown a lot of flexibility in the ongoing negotiations to expand the Information Technology Agreement and has failed to implement the adverse World Trade Organization decision on electronic payments. The U.S. opposition is backed only by Japan, and to a lesser extent Canada. In addition to laying out her conditions, Reding also emphasized that the parliament will take a more active interest in the negotiations, after not having been closely involved so far.\" You will hear a lot on this subject [of TISA] in 2015 [from the Parliament],\" she . She dismissed as \"completely wrong\" claims that TISA could be concluded this  and  2015 will be a working  to push the negotiations ahead \"with the contribution on the parliament.\" Parliament will hold a public hearing on TISA on Feb. 24, but Reding did not provide further details. That will be less than two weeks after the first TISA round of 2015, hosted by the U.S. Mission in Geneva from Feb. 913. Parliament will also this  present a report detailing its position on TISA further after consulting with the public and private sectors, NGOs, social partners and national parliaments, according to Reding. She gave no timeline for the release of the report. Reding split her conditions into two groups: five that must be included in the TISA and five that must be excluded from a final deal which she designated as red lines. In the second group, Reding highlighted the need to keep strong protections for personal data, and  she was \"rather nervous when I see what going on so far in the TISA negotiation\" in light of an April 2014 U.S. proposal on the free flow of data leaked late last . \"We will not accept that through the back door our established rules on data protection could be wiped out,\" she . \"So we will be extraordinarily cautious on this chapter and we expect from the European Union that it acts on this in order to defend the basic rules\" of its privacy protection regime. In a Dec. 3 Committee on International Trade hearing, Reding attacked a U.S. proposal on ensuring the free flow of data as seeking to specifically create exemptions to privacy and data protection. The U.S. proposal would seek to establish broad rights for private service suppliers to transfer information including personal data into and out of a party territory, as long as it is in connection with the conduct of the firm business. The language being advocated by the U.S. does not contain an explicit exception for data privacy measures or other reservations, in contrast to the other provisions in the proposal aimed at removing localization requirements. The data transfer provision is contained in \"Article X.4: Movement of Information\" of the leaked text, and appears to be a proposal for TISA ecommerce annex. It would apply across all sectors covered by the agreement. Her demands for TISA exclusions also cited health, education, and water services. \"They are not for sale,\" she . She also  there can be no chapter on the movement of natural persons, as the issue of immigration must be left to member states. There would be a \"tsunami of public opinion if the EU were to remove its rules\" on immigration, according to Reding. The temporary movement of natural persons is known as the Mode 4 of services supply is being raised in the TISA negotiations by the European Commission, which in June 2014 tabled a proposal that would delineate three categories of professionals covered by such commitments Among the items that Reding  must be included, she cited high international standards for doing business in such areas as telecommunications, air and maritime transport sectors. These should reflect the EU existing standards in those areas, she . The agreement must result in foreign services markets becoming as open as the European Union market, Reding . Nontariff barriers drive up the cost of doing business for EU companies an additional 15 percent in Canada and go up to as high as 68 percent additional cost in China, she . An acceptable TISA deal would have to bring those costs closer to the 6 percent additional cost that foreign companies are faced with when operating in the EU, according to Reding. The parliament also expects to see tangible benefits for EU citizens in the areas of online shopping, consumer protection in online banking and when traveling abroad, she . In addition, she  a statetostate dispute mechanism should be included in the WTO framework to ensure that the agreement is enforced.',\n",

Capitanich considered possible to establish bilateral negotiation criteria with the complaining countries, US, Japan and the EU, 'but in a context analysis' WTO rejected Argentinas bid to overturn a ruling that considered Argentine licensing rules were used to unlawfully restrict imports. In his daily message to the press at Government House, President Cristina Fernandez chief of ministers on Thursday considered possible to establish bilateral negotiation criteria with the complaining countries United States, Japan and the European Union , but not without carrying out first an analysis of the context, considering the financial crisis is still hitting hard on the global economy. On Thursday, the WTO rejected Argentinas bid to overturn a ruling in favor of the US, the EU and Japan in a case against Argentine licensing rules that the international body  have been used to unlawfully restrict imports. Furthermore, the cabinet chief blasted media operations that report an alleged lack of certain goods and supplies, something he blamed companies lack of planning or speculative actions for. Shortfall of certain goods or supplies, he affirmed, is not a matter of restriction or import authorizations. Argentina is within the first ten countries that have increased imports the most over the past eleven , the ex governor of the Chaco province  stressing that the nations now battling against Buenos Aires at the WTO are those that receive complaints the most due to their own trade practices. Speculative attacks and foreign currency wars distort growth perspectives of the world economy and trade, the head of ministers continued, denouncing a structural crisis of the financial system that began in 2008 prompting severe consequences since then. Except for 2009, in 2014 the lowest rate of global GDP growth was registered, with 1.8%, while in Latin American it was of 1 percent, the official explained saying such scenario led to difficulties in the financing of global trade.\",\n",
       " 'U.S. Raises Alarm at WTO Dispute Findings in Chinese Countervailing Duties Case By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 19, 2015 Jan. 16 The U.S. further expressed its disappointment with a recent World Trade Organization decision that  U.S. countervailing duty investigations into a range of Chinese products violated international trade rules. Last month the WTO dispute settlement appellate body found that in the 17 investigations at issue, the U.S. violated a number of provisions of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) (244 WTO, 12/19/14). The U.S.  that the appellate body did not adhere to the terms of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) and had issued problematic findings with respect to the treatment of stateowned enterprises (SOEs) in determining market benchmarks, according to comments delivered at a Jan. 16 special meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in Geneva. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body will now urge the U.S. to bring its practices into compliance with international obligations or face retaliatory trade measures from China. The Chinese products at the center of these investigations include solar panels, wind towers, thermal paper, coated paper, towbehind lawn groomers, kitchen shelving, steel sinks, citric acid, magnesia carbon bricks, pressure pipe, line pipe, seamless pipe, steel cylinders, drill pipe, oil country tubular goods, wire strand and aluminum extrusions. WTO Overreach, Problems The U.S.  that it was concerned the appellate body presented new arguments that had not been offered by China and used them to rule in China favor. The appellate body developed legal interpretations of the SCM Agreement, and then sought to apply these interpretations to the U.S. measures without regard to the case made by China through the evidence and arguments it actually submitted to the panel, the U.S.  at the Jan. 16 meeting. In doing so, the appellate body assumed a role more like an investigative authority, the U.S. . This role is not provided for under the DSU. As for the issue of SOEs and public bodies, the WTO appellate panel has departed from its well reasoned finding in U.S.Softwood Lumber IV that private prices from armslength transactions in the country of provision are the primary benchmark, the U.S. . The appellate body reversed an earlier decision that upheld the Commerce Department rejection of setting benchmarks for valuing government benefits that are based on private prices in China. The U.S. had argued that those prices were distorted by the Chinese government influential role in the market as a supplier of the goods in question. The U.S.  that the appellate body provided no meaningful explanation about how a price by a government entity could be used to establish a marketbased benchmark, according to its remarks at the Jan. 16 meeting. The U.S. commended the panel for rejecting the Chinese argument that investigating bodies must determine that SOEs are public bodies before determining its pricing benchmarks. DOC Investigations Unlawful The appellate body decision removed any doubt about the unlawful nature of the USDOC [U.S. Department of Commerce] current approach to its investigation of alleged input subsides, the Chinese delegation  at the Jan. 16 meeting. It is evident that the time has come for the USDOC to fundamentally rethink its entire construct for input subsidy investigations. The decision has a great significance not only for China but also for WTO members more broadly, China . The appellate body findings, as well as the unappealed findings of the panel, constitute an emphatic rejection of the USDOC entire analytical framework for determining the existence of alleged input subsidies. China noted that the lack of legal analysis in the prior panel is indicative of a divergence of quality between the appellate and dispute settlement panels that has become a systemic issue within the dispute settlement process. China has a great concern in this taking into account that Chinese industries have [been] injured by the abuse of trade remedy measures by the United States, it . China believes that this issue is deserving of careful consideration by all WTO members.',\n",

According to officials, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, during his visit to the Vibrant Gujarat summit, brought up the worries over the governments push for use of indigenous technology, calling it the new make in India law. In particular, sources told The Hindu , the U.S. administration is irked over the governments announcement of a series of 1,000MW gridconnected solar photovoltaic (PV) power projects that has a mandatory condition that all PV cells and modules used in solar plants set up under this scheme will be made in India. The announcement, made on December 18, came amid the ongoing dispute at the World Trade Organisation (WTO DISPUTE DS456), where the U.S. has complained against India over the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Missions domestic content requirement (DCR) for solar cells and solar modules in projects that it awards. India maintains that U.S. subsidies on solar products threaten India manufacturers, and the domestic solar industry has accused the U.S. of dumping cheap outdated technology on India. The WTO composed its panel in September 2014, but even as the matter over the UPA governments domestic content requirements was being decided, the NDAs emphasis on Make in India has raised new questions from the U.S. administration. Speaking to The Hindu , Renewable Energy Minister Piyush Goyal, who met Mr. Kerry in Gandhinagar,  he was confident of ironing out the creases with the U.S. officials, while maintaining that India was committed to its recently announced target of 1,00,000MW solar power capacity by 2022. We are going ahead with our new renewable energy policy regardless of who will invest in it, Mr. Goyal .',\n",

The requests represent the shoring up of challenges launched last week by the two companies to a pact finalized by the United States and Mexico to end a dispute over sugar that has plagued the North American marketplace for nearly a . Imperial Sugar and AmCane, both U.S. refiners of raw cane sugar, have requested that the Commerce Department continue its probe, and have simultaneously notified the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) of the requests, according to documents dated Jan. 16. These challenges follow requests from both companies that the ITC review the pact hammered out by the Commerce Department and Mexican officials, saying that it did not eliminate harm to their businesses. Should the ITC decide the deal stands, these requests would require the Commerce Department and ITC to resume their probes, and make a final decision. The two rounds of challenges could hamper the finalization of the deal announced by the Commerce Department on Dec. 19. A spokeswoman for Louis Dreyfus and representatives from AmCane could not immediately be reached for comment, given the late hour. The challenges will likely stoke worries over supplies in the United States, as flows of sugar from its top foreign supplier have dried up after the Commerce Department decided in August and October to levy large duties on Mexican imports. \"It going to get dicey if this goes into April or later,\"  Frank Jenkins, president of the largest raw sugar physical and futures broker in the United States. \"People will be hesitant to bring sugar from Mexico under these conditions.\" Mexico and the United States have been embroiled in a dispute over the sweetener since a coalition of U.S. producer groups asked the U.S. government in March 2014 to investigate dumping of subsidized sugar from Mexico.

       " 'Obama steps up battle to win fasttrack trade deal authority Shawn Donnan, World Trade Editor 18 January 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Barack Obama drew raucous cheers from the left of his Democratic party and powerful unions when the then presidential candidate promised in 2008 to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. But six  after taking office, with the US setting out to close a trade deal with Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim economies in the coming months, the president is drawing jeers from within his own party and big labour unions over trade policy. The encouraging noises these days are coming largely from big business and Republicans in Congress. That dynamic is set to come to the fore with Tuesday State of the Union address and what people within the Obama administration say will be the beginning of a concerted \"whole of White House\" push to secure socalled \"fasttrack\" authority to negotiate trade deals for the president. Getting what is formally known as Trade Promotion Authority from Congress is crucial for the administration and its trade ambitions, which also include reaching a transatlantic agreement with the EU. The US constitution gives Congress jurisdiction over foreign commercial relations. For decades the way around that has been for Congress to delegate authority to presidents to negotiate trade deals and commit to having a simple, speedy up or down vote on trade agreements once they are concluded. But that authority expired in 2007 and Mr Obama has procrastinated since in securing it. Now, the traditionally protrade Republicans who control both houses of Congress after November midterm elections say they are eager to give it to him and hail it as a potential area of bipartisan cooperation. \"The first thing we have to do is pass Trade Promotion Authority,\" Paul Ryan, chair of the House ways and means committee,  last week. Many Democrats, however, oppose granting Mr Obama that power and see it as antithetical to an increasingly bold domestic agenda. They argue that globalisation and US trade policy have contributed to the offshoring of jobs, rising inequality and wage stagnation for American workers over the past 20 . To them Mr Obama trade push and the 12country TransPacific Partnership, or TPP, in particular stand in opposition to his domestic pledges. \"I am sure that Wall Street wants this. The people that are funding the Republican party are big on this thing. But I don\\'t think there is any evidence in the long run that this is going to benefit the workers of this country,\" says Jim McDermott, a longtime Democratic congressman from Washington state. Part of the problem for the Obama administration is that some Democrats like Mr McDermott feel they were burnt by past votes for trade agreements like Nafta. \"I\\'ve been told again and again by Democrats and Republicans that this [trade] thing we are doing is the best thing since sliced bread. But it hasn\\'t always worked out that way,\" he says. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. <>Mr Obama supporters argue his trade push is part of a strategic response to the rise of China and getting ahead of Beijing in setting rules for the global economy. But more ly, they argue, it is about helping open overseas markets for US companies and job creation. During a meeting with US business leaders last month, the president accused Democratic critics of his trade agenda of fighting the \"last war\". By insisting on including chapters on labour and the environment in the TPP, which includes Nafta partners Canada and Mexico, the administration says it is living up to the president 2008 promise to renegotiate the North American deal. It also, officials argue, is delivering something his party left should be happy about. \"This is the most progressive trade agenda in US history. Twenty  ago, labour and environment protections were afterthoughts [and] now they will be core, enforceable parts of our trade agreements,\" says Mike Froman, the US trade representative. Given Republican control of Congress and the likelihood that at least some Democrats will back it, granting the president fasttrack authority ought to be a done deal. People close to the process predict a vote by the end of March. Although they still expect a tough fight, Republicans and the administration are eager to build Democratic support. The president has been personally lobbying labour leaders. Cabinet members have been given the task of convincing Democratic sceptics and aides are circulating a colourcoded target list of some 80 Democrats whose backing they want to secure. The push is on and with good reason. After  of negotiations Mr Obama is, with the TPP, close to securing the biggest regional trade agreement a US president has landed since Nafta went into force in 1994.',\n",

       " 'IMF slashes 20152016 world growth forecast Paul HANDLEY 20 January 2015 Agence France Presse The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday sharply cut its 20152016 world growth forecast of only six months ago, saying lower oil prices did not offset pervasive weaknesses around the globe. The IMF  poorer prospects in China, Russia, the euro area and Japan will hold world GDP growth to just 3.5 percent this  and 3.7 percent in 2016. The forecasts were lower than the 3.8 percent and 4 percent growth for 2015 and 2016 respectively given in the previous World Economic Outlook in October. The cut underscored the steady deterioration of the economic picture for many countries, due to sluggish investment, slowing trade and falling commodity prices. While the United States will remain the one bright spot among major economies, Europe will continue to struggle with disinflation, the IMF . Meanwhile, China growth which Beijing  Tuesday had slowed to 7.4 percent in 2014, its weakest for 24  will decelerate further, hit by poor export growth and a real estate slump, the organization . The IMF forecast that the United States, the world largest economy, will expand by 3.6 percent this , up a halfpercentage point from the previous outlook. But the economy of China, the global number two, is expected to grow 6.8 percent this , the IMF  0.3 percent slower than previously expected and 6.3 percent in 2016. The last time Chinese growth fell below seven percent was in the crunch of 1990, when it slowed to 3.8 percent. \"Lower growth in China will have an adverse effect on its trade partners, in particular on the rest of Asia,\" Oliver Blanchard, the IMF chief economist,  at a briefing in Beijing, as the organisation also downgraded growth prospects for other Asian countries. For the eurozone and Japan, it , \"stagnation and low inflation are still concerns\" requiring sustained monetary easing and other measures to keep interest rates from rising. In the eurozone, where the region central bank is expected to decide to boost stimulus this week, low oil prices and the depreciated euro are a help to growth. But it will also struggle with low investment levels and poorer demand for the region exports from emerging economies. The region is expected to expand 1.2 percent in 2015, and 1.4 percent next . Japan stimulus has not worked as well as expected, and the IMF expects it to expand just 0.6 percent this , picking up to a stillsluggish 0.8 percent in 2016. \"At this stage potential mediumterm growth in Japan is very very low,\" Blanchard . \"So far both private domestic and foreign demand have disappointed.\" Russia, already pressed by sanctions over its support for secessionists in Ukraine, is particularly hurt by lower oil prices. The IMF now says the Russian economy will contract 3.0 percent this  and 1.0 percent in 2016. In October the IMF was still predicting slight growth for the country. The world crisis lender warned that continued volatility in markets, partially a product of the US beginning to tighten monetary policy, pushing the dollar higher, will challenge governments and central banks around the world for some time to come. And while the halving of crude prices is a net positive for the world, the strong dollar partially negates that effect for many oil importers using weakening currencies. And the impact of slower growth in trade, low commodity prices and market turbulence will all but erase the gains from cheap oil. \"New factors supporting growth lower oil prices, but also depreciation of euro and yen are more than offset by persistent negative forces, including the lingering legacies of the crisis and lower potential growth in many countries,\"  Blanchard, the IMF chief economist. It meant \"good news for oil importers, bad news for oil exporters\" he added. \"Good news for commodity importers, bad news for exporters... Good news for countries more linked to the euro and the yen, bad news for those more linked to the dollar.\" The IMF stressed that countries need to persist in restructuring, reform and investment despite the weaker conditions. \"Raising actual and potential output is a policy priority in most economies... There is an urgent need for structural reforms in many economies, advanced and emerging market alike,\" even as they face different choices and needs in their overall economic policies, it . It included in that prescription the need for governments to take advantage of lower oil prices to cut subsidies to strengthen their budgets for the long term.',\n",
       " 'China Economic Growth Is Slowest in Decades 20 January 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News By Mark Magnier, Lingling Wei And Ian Talley BEIJINGChina economic growth slowed to 7.4% in 2014, downshifting to a level not seen in a quarter century and firmly marking the end of a highgrowth heyday that buoyed global demand for everything from iron ore to designer handbags. The slipping momentum in China, which reported economic growth of 7.7% in 2013, has reverberated around the world, sending prices for commodities tumbling and weakening an already soft global economy. China economy grew 7.3% in the fourth quarter from a  earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics , buttressed by targeted moves to ease borrowing. But it continued to face a housing glut, soaring debt and overcapacity in many industries, factors likely to erode growth in 2015. Beijing had  it expected \"about\" 7.5% growth in 2014. The chief of the statistics bureau  Tuesday the rate was within that range. Chinese stocks rose on the news, a day after their largest oneday drop in more than six  following a crackdown on margin trading. While 7% growth would be the envy of most economies, Beijing says at least this level is needed to create enough jobs for China huge population. The Communist Party sees social stability as an essential component in maintaining its grip on power. The results follow decades of growth that has hovered around 10%, one of the broadest, most rapid economic ascents in history that helped raise Chinese living standards and propel global growth and trade to new heights. Slipping economic momentum in China has had farflung implications, squeezing Australian government budgets and Chilean copper mines that grew increasingly dependent on China ascent. The slowdown comes at a vulnerable time for the world economy. The eurozone is at risk of a third recession in six . Abenomics policies have failed to lift Japan out of stagnation. And output in many major emerging marketsthat provided most of the impetus for global growth over the past decadeis slowing faster than expected. The U.S. economy remains the one global bright spot, but it will struggle to make up for growing weakness elsewhere. Economists see the slowdown of 2014 as the prelude to an extended deceleration of growth. The often bullish International Monetary Fund on Monday forecast 6.8% growth for China in 2015, a number below the 7.0% target economists expect Beijing to set. \"The housing slowdown is more serious than we thought earlier,\"  IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard in an interview. Others are even more downbeat. Oxford Economics predicts 6.5% and says it expects this  will be the last time China growth exceeds 6%. Leaders since mid2014 have emphasized a \"new normal\" of slower growth. As the government tries to manage expectations, Premier Li Keqiang signaled Monday the economy would continue to face downward pressure this . How China addresses the slowdown matters to the leadership goal of restructuring the economy so it is powered by domestic consumption and service industries. Reliance on real estate, construction and smokestack industries has reached its limits, as evidenced by rising debt and polluted skies over much of the country. Now President Xi Jinping and other leaders find themselves with constricted options to shore up the economy as they seek to avoid the missteps of large economic stimulus after the 2008 global financial crisis. Then, the leadership opened the credit taps to cushion a falloff in foreign demand and investment. Now, the problems are at home, and many are hangovers from the earlier binge, as are a plethora of whiteelephant projects, such as nearly empty malls, ghost cities and bridges to nowhere. \"This time around, they\\'re not giving money away,\"  ING economist Tim Condon. \"They don\\'t want to do that again.\" \"Sure, they\\'d like to regain economic momentum,\"  Royal Bank of Scotland economist Louis Kuijs. \"But at the moment I don\\'t think anyone expects that.\" It is getting harder for the government to target credit to specific sectors, such as agriculture, and transportation, as banks balk at adding more nonperforming loans and borrowers hesitate. LD Forge, a maker of forged valve components in Wenzhou, is among the companies that say its customers face cashflow problems. \"We are facing quite a lot of delays in payment,\"  Yu Mingliang, the company vice president of business development. \"We ended up suing one company.\" Even if it wants to ramp up spending, Beijing is bumping up against tappedout local governments. That is partly by design: Much of what ailing the economy now is the result of rampant localgovernment borrowing via vehicles created for the purpose with little oversight. New policies have been aimed at reining in such loans. As Beijing tries to speed up investments in airports and other infrastructure projects, these policies could leave the municipalities and provinces unable to find funds to see the plans through. Funding constraints have already forced some cities to slow down bigticket investments. In Wuhan, an industrial city in central China, the city government has halted construction of a bridge across the Yangtze River since last  due to insufficient funds, according to local officials familiar with the matter. The bridge, with a planned investment of about 8 billion yuan, could help ease local traffic congestion. Press officials in the city government didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. An aggressive anticorruption campaign, which the government deems essential to maintaining the Communist Party grip on power, is also dragging down spending and, some analysts say, impeding government decisionmaking. Lu Ting, a China economist at Bank of America Corp., has estimated the austerity push has pared between 0.6 and 1.5 percentage points of growth from China GDP. The World Bank has already downgraded its outlook for the global economy. In a report released last week it estimated the world economy would grow 3% this , compared with the 3.4% projection it made last June. It  a slowdown in business investment in China alone could shave 0.3% to 0.5% from global economic output. Speaking to an investor conference last week, General Motors Co. President Dan Ammann called China \"the major engine of growth\" for the global auto industry for the past decade and a half. He  the auto maker still sees big opportunity in lowerprofile cities in China, but \"we\\'re no longer in an environment where you can just build something and expect to sell it.\" In recent months, as growth in China residential real estate has slowed, United Technologies Corp. has  it is coping thanks to stronger orders for government infrastructure and large commercial projects, like an order for 103 elevators and escalators for a new tower in the northern city of Tianjin. Meanwhile, its Otis Elevator business has also been trying to boost the percentage of service contracts it maintains for elevators already installed in China, which can provide steady earnings even when construction growth slows. The global effects of China slowdown have hit unevenly, with the World Bank projecting that emerging markets, whose economies rely more heavily on trade with China, will be hit the hardest. The World Bank estimates economic output in Brazil will expand just 1% in 2015, down from a June forecast of 2.7%. Commodities importers, on the other hand, might receive some secondhand benefits as the price of imported shipments decline. The U.S. could be among these beneficiaries. The World Bank raised its estimate of U.S. economic growth to 3.2% from 3.0%. Should growth decline precipitously in coming months, economists say Beijing has a number of options, including deeper interest rate cuts, faster spending on infrastructure projects and sequential reductions in the capital that banks must hold on reserve with the central bank. The risk, however, is that if pursued too aggressively such measures could worsen overcapacity and pile up more debt. \"If things start to deteriorate rapidly, they might have to shift their policy approach,\"  Julian EvansPritchard, an economist with research firm Capital Economics. \"But if it doesn\\'t, I don\\'t expect much change in policy.\"',\n",
       " 'Government may challenge World Trade Organization’s order to lift ban on US poultry imports Dilasha Seth 20 January 2015 The Economic Times NEW DELHI: Competitively priced American frozen chicken legs may take longer to hit the India market as the government is set to challenge the World Trade Organization’s October order asking it to lift a ban on poultry imports from the US. Simultaneously, the government is brainstorming with stakeholders on ways to protect the growing domestic poultry industry from the inflow of US chicken legs, which are cheaper by about Rs 100 per kg. India banned US poultry imports on account of avian influenza in 2007, a decision the WTO called ‘unscientific’ in its judgment. “We are ready with our argument and will be filing an appeal in a day or two to the appellate body. We are expecting an improvement in the dispute settlement panel decision, which will help us in future,” a government official . “We are committed to protect the industry with huge employment potential and are looking at various measures to that effect. We have had a meeting with the poultry industry and breeders.” India is the fourthlargest producer of chicken in the world, after the US, China and Brazil, with an annual production of 3.54 million tonnes. Last week, China banned the import of US poultry and eggs after the detection of an avian flu strain in the Pacific Northwest. More than 20 countries, including members of the EU, South Korea and South Africa, have imposed curbs on poultry from certain US states or the entire country. With US consumers preferring chicken breasts, the lessfavoured chicken legs are frozen for export to other markets at highly competitive prices. “As Russia has also banned American poultry, they are really eyeing the India market to sell chicken legs frozen for the last fourfive  at may be Rs 4050 a kg compared to Rs 160 170 a kg price prevailing in India,”  another official privy to the matter. The department of commerce called a meeting that was attended by representatives of the All India Poultry Breeders’ Association and others to suggest ways to protect the domestic industry and assess the grounds on which other countries have banned US poultry. But as per WTO rules, national treatment must be accorded, which means the domestic industry must be subjected to the same rules as the foreign seller. Given that the US will export chicken legs that are four to five  old, India could restrict imports to products that are not more than six months old,  a poultry expert. “For this, FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) can come out with standards,” he . According to experts, India could also look at options such as antidumping duties to curb imports and use the argument that the chicken are fed with genetically modified food. “US chicken is given genetically modified feed, which is not allowed in India. They are also injected with a lot of hormones,”  an expert who asked not to be identified.The EU banned US chicken on account of chlorine treatment. An antidumping case could be possible but difficult.“ If India files an antidumping case, it will have to allow US chicken for a  to assess the dumping margin or else dumping analysis can be done by apprehending the price at which US sells to different markets, which will be difficult,”  the expert.',\n",
       " 'WTO membership a major contributor to exports and economic growth of Vietnam 19 January 2015 Vietnam News Summary In a recent interview granted to a Radio Voice of Vietnam (VOV) reporter, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Representative in Vietnam Sanjay Kalra touched upon limitations and challenges facing Vietnam in its international integration process after it joined the WTO eight  ago. The results achieved after 8  of Vietnam’s entry to the world largest trade body are of paramount importance as the nation has become an attractive destination for foreign investors. More and more major foreign enterprises and groups are bent on investing in Vietnam to take advantage of incentives investment policies. Increased foreign investment has significantly contributed to export growth and economic stability of Vietnam over the past . On a more positive note, Vietnam’s drastic changes in laws and institutions have helped simplify procedures and improve the business and investment environment, he . The Southeast Asian nation’s underway commitments after its admission to the WTO such as cutting taxes, opening the market for goods and services have offered Vietnamese consumers plentiful opportunities to enjoy better products at cheaper prices, the IMF official noted. Regarding Vietnam’s sustained efforts for international integration by conducting negotiations and signing bilateral and multilateral agreements, Sanjay Kalra  the international economic integration process is an inevitable trend for Vietnam. Free trade agreements provide a wealth of opportunity for both consumers and businesses, helping Vietnamese goods and services have easier access to the most demanding and potential markets. “I hope that Vietnam will speed up negotiations and is likely to conclude  free trade agreement (FTA) agreements and the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement in the time ahead and the international economic integration is a long process.” he added. Concerning measures to cope with challenges and capitalize on the advantages presented by the WTO, Sanjay Kalra underlined the need to reform and improve the competitiveness of Vietnamese enterprises both domestically and internationally in a bid to make better use of the advantages of the WTO. There is much that needs to be done in connection with institutional and procedural reforms, infrastructure improvement and investment cost reduction for businesses. But the forefront is the necessity to improve the capacity and skills of Vietnamese workers, enabling them to grasp better employment opportunities and keep pace with the waves of foreign investment coming to Vietnam. Talking about prospects for Vietnam economy in 2015, the IMF representative  the national economy would continue its steady growth since 2014 with low inflation, relatively stable exchange rates and deeper economic integration. However, future challenges require the Vietnam Government to make stronger reforms for 2015 2016. For example, banking reform will help stabilize the financial market while reform and equitization of Stateowned enterprises (SoEs) will help attract more capital and improve business governance and reduce the burden on the state budget. It is essential take into account the impacts of the global economy in 2015 as declining oil prices benefit the economy but will affect Vietnam’s budget revenues. Generally, the outlook for 2015 is positive but the nation needs to spare no effort to maintain macroeconomic stability and improve infrastructure facilities, he noted. (VOV News – January 18)',\n",
       " 'China 2014 cotton imports hit five low By Dominique Patton BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) China imported 264,500 tonnes of cotton in December, down 57 percent from the same month a  ago, while full imports dropped 41 percent to 2.4 million tonnes, a five low. The annual number is the lowest since 2009 when imports for the  came to 1.5 million tonnes. Demand for cotton in the world top consumer of the fibre is a major driver of global prices. A government stockpiling scheme from 20112013 pushed domestic prices well above the international market, causing imports to surpass 5 million tonnes in 2012. But an overhaul of that policy pressured domestic prices, reducing the premium over New York futures and undercutting the incentive for imports. Beijing gave out fewer import quotas last  as well, further tempering demand. \"Since September some imports have also been replaced by domestic cotton,\"  a trade source, who declined to be identified. Chinese cotton prices plunged in September, tracking a drop in the international prices to five lows. Demand has picked up recently, with U.S. sales figures showing strong buying from the world No. 2 economy last week, surprising the market. Still, traders expect full imports for 2015 to drop further as the government keeps a tighter grip on import quotas. Beijing will issue 894,000 tonnes of low tariff import quota for 2015, according to its WTO commitments, but it will not issue additional quotas unless the market falls short of supply, officials have . China cotton imports in 2015 will fall to around 1.5 million tonnes, according to the latest estimate by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.',\n",

More than 212 million people will be jobless by 2019 against the current level of 201 million, the International Labour Organization . \"The global economy is continuing to grow at tepid rates and that has clear consequences,\" ILO head Guy Ryder told reporters in Geneva. \"The global jobs gap due to the crisis stands at 61 million jobs worldwide,\" he , referring to the number of jobs lost since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. The ILO World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2015 report  an extra 280 million jobs would have to be created by 2019 to close the gap created by the financial turmoil. \"This means the jobs crisis is far from over and there is no place for complacency,\" Ryder .

The UN agency  the steep fall in oil and gas prices would hit the labour market hard in producing countries in Latin America, Africa and the Arab world. But one of the rare bits of good news was that the middle class comprised more than 34 percent of total employment in developing countries from 20 percent in the 1990s, Ryder . However extreme poverty continues to affect one out of 10 workers globally who earn less than $1.50 a day, he added. A widening chasm between the haves and have nots and an uncertain investment climate have made it difficult for countries to rebound from the crisis, the report . Cutting wages has been a key element in the international bailouts of eurozone members.

       " 'Swiss franc fallout claims more casualties Philip Stafford, Caroline Binham and Miles Johnson in London Financial Times Last updated: January 19, 2015 6:14 pm A leading European foreign exchange broker filed for administration on Monday and a Danish bank conceded it faced heavy losses as the UK’s market regulator stepped in to assess the damage wreaked on the industry by last week’s violent swing in the Swiss franc. The Financial Conduct Authority sent letters to an unspecified number of currency brokers on Friday asking them to update the regulator about any impact the Swiss move could have had on their balance sheets, according to a person familiar with the situation. Global markets were left reeling last Thursday when Switzerland unexpectedly abandoned its currency ceiling against the euro. In one of the most damaging currency swings in the modern trading era, the Swiss franc soared in value, leaving investment banks across the world with big losses and hitting foreign exchange brokers particularly hard. Alpari became one of the biggest casualties when a lastminute rescue ended in failure. Meanwhile, Denmark’s Saxo Bank was forced to admit on Monday that it was likely to suffer losses. The fallout of the Swiss franc’s move has heightened scrutiny of a lightly regulated industry in which customers are often offered large amounts of leverage by companies to entice them to trade. London has been the venue for many of these brokers as it remains the world’s main hub for currency trading. Punters deposit money with the broker and use it as collateral to borrow a much larger amount and magnify their trading positions. In London it is customary to offer 100200 times the amount deposited into an account, although higher sums are available. Some brokers had a policy of covering client losses beyond their deposit in the short term, thus allowing customers to gear up their accounts. Violent market moves — such as that of the Swiss franc last week — mean investment prices fluctuate substantially and can trigger immediate calls for large payments of margin from customers, who may not be able to pay immediately. Some brokers such as IG Group, CMC Markets, Swissquote, Oanda and Interactive Brokers, survived the Swiss franc’s violent gyrations, but sustained losses. USbased FXCM, which handled a record $1.4tn in trades made by individuals last quarter, took a $300m cash lifeline from Leucadia National, owner of investment bank Jefferies, to ward off fears it would breach its capital requirements while New Zealand’s Global Brokers was forced to close. Saxo Bank  it would fulfil all of its regulatory capital requirements though it would also be likely to incur some losses from customers unable to pay their debts. The group doubled its margin requirements for Swiss franc trades last September to 8 per cent, which effectively halved the amount of leverage available to customers to around 12.5 times. Meanwhile KPMG was appointed as special administrator to Alpari (UK) Ltd after the group failed over the weekend to agree a rescue takeover deal. “We have had a number of enquiries from interested parties in relation to the company’s business,”  Richard Heis, one of the KPMG administrators. “We will be speaking with these parties and others over the next few days, and hope to secure a deal to preserve the business and jobs as far as possible.” Alpari, which employs about 170 people in London, has nearly $100m in client money which has been segregated under FCA rules. The FCA is in the middle of a rootandbranch review of the retail forex sector, still under wraps. Its socalled thematic review last  looked into 40 banks, brokers and asset managers, including providers of contractsfordifference. It found that firms were failing to get the best terms on client trades, leaving customers millions of pounds out of pocket. It shares similar concerns, according to FCA insiders, to France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers, which published a paper last  outlining that 85 per cent of customers lost money through retailforex trading. It is still unclear what proposals, if any, might result from the FCA’s ongoing review, and whether it may result in action. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'WTO informal talks to ascertain positions NAYANIMA BASU New Delhi 21 January 2015 Business Standard The World Trade Organization (WTO) is to hold an informal meeting on Wednesday with the heads of delegations, including of India, in Geneva. The aim is to ascertain the positions of countries on the postBali work programme, an  element being a solution to the food stock issue. “The informal meeting is to kick off the negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement on the postBali work programme and wider Doha Round in the near future. This meeting will outline the countries’ positions on how to proceed and where there could be difficulties,” an official told Business Standard. The outcome is expected to “feed into the ministers’ discussions in a way” when they meet in Davos on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Saturday for a ‘miniministerial’. The official added that negotiations on a permanent solution had started and should intensify in the next couple of months. A WTO ministerial is the highest decision making body. A miniministerial refers to a meeting of ministers from some key countries like America, Germany, Canada, Australia, India, China and Brazil. India will be represented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Developed countries are increasingly worried that developing countries such as India and China might be “reluctant” to negotiate a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue, now that they have a concession in a ‘Peace Clause’ that will be in perpetuity until a permanent solution, officials . India and China run massive public stockholding schemes, resulting in huge subsidies. WTO director general Roberto Azevêdo recently stated they’d put a mandate on the 160 membercountries to identify their negotiating stance on the entire Doha package by July. It has also set a deadline of December this  for a permanent solution to the food stock issue. In December, the WTO is going to hold its 10th ministerial meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. Under pressure from India, the WTO membership agreed to change what was agreed in Bali, Indonesia, during the ninth ministerial. Instead of four , India obtained a permanent ‘Peace Clause’ that gives it freedom to grant unlimited subsidies to its poor and marginal farmers. This interim measure also gives immunity to India from challenges by other countries even if it exceeds the limit prescribed under earlier WTO norms.',\n",

It did so in a 5346 vote in favor of tabling the amendment. The U.S. steel industry had opposed the amendment and expected it to fail. In a Jan. 20 conference call with reporters, American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) President Thomas Gibson  his group supports the underlying bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and wants the Senate to approve legislation that is as close as possible to the version passed by the House on Jan. 9. The Housepassed bill does not include the \"Buy American\" requirement. Gibson also indicated that while his group supports Buy American requirements for public projects like highways and bridges, imposing them on a private construction project like the Keystone XL pipeline is not viable because it could violate U.S. trade obligations. \"The pipeline is a private project, not a government procurement project, so the same rules can\\'t apply,\" he . Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Lisa Murkowski (RAK)  during floor remarks opposing the amendment that she worried it would lead to a \"slippery slope\" of the government directing a private company to use specific materials for a project. She  \"this would be the first time that Congress has directed or forced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials.\" One trade expert  that applying a blanket \"Buy American\" requirement to a private construction project could violate the national treatment obligations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Specifically, GATT Article III:4 requires signatories\\' laws and regulations to accord imported goods treatment that is \"no less favorable\" than that accorded to domestic products. Government procurement is excluded from the GATT, although the U.S. has committed to open up some public contracts to foreign suppliers under the Government Procurement Agreement. The Senate amendment, which was offered by Sen. Al Franken (DMN) and had four Democratic cosponsors, included language stating that the Buy American requirement should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the U.S. obligations under international trade agreements. Asked whether this would effectively nullify the Buy American requirement, Gibson  this question was speculative because he did not expect the amendment would pass. The White House has threatened that President Obama would veto the Keystone bill. The Club for Growth, a conservative group focused on freemarket issues, on Jan. 19 issued a key vote alert against the Franken amendment, meaning the vote will be included on its legislative scorecard. According to the alert, the amendment would \"invite retaliation from other countries, as has happened in the past when Congress has approved \\'Buy American\\' language.\" The Franken amendment, which was cosponsored by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (DWI), Joe Manchin (DWV), Barbara Mikulski (DMD) and Debbie Stabenow (DMI), would have required that, \"to the maximum extent consistent with the obligations of the United States under international trade agreements,\" iron, steel and other manufactured goods used for the pipeline and facilities approved by the bill be produced in the U.S. It also provided two specific exceptions to the Buy American requirement, the first of which would have applied if iron, steel and the applicable manufactured goods are \"not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities with a sufficient quality.\" The other exception would have applied if using U.S. goods increases the cost of the construction by more than 25 percent. The Keystone bill authorizes TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, the company behind the pipeline, \"to construct, connect, operate, and maintain the pipeline and crossborder facilities specified in an application filed … to the Department of State.\" On Jan. 7, the White House issued a veto threat to the House version of the Keystone bill, saying in an Office of Management and Budget statement that it would \"circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether crossborder pipelines serve the national interest\" by preempting the administration permitting process.',\n",

       " 'OfficePaper Makers Allege Dumping, Seek Import Duties 21 January 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News By James R. Hagerty Four paper manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union are asking the U.S. government to impose duties on imports of office paper that they say are priced unfairly low. Their claim, due to be filed with the U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday, alleges that rivals in China, Indonesia, Brazil, Portugal and Australia are dumping certain types of uncoated paper on the U.S. market, including that used for such things as computer printers, book publishing, junk mail and envelopes. Dumping involves selling at prices deemed less than \"fair value,\" which can mean below the price in the exporter home country or less than the cost of production plus a reasonable profit. The companies also say producers in China and Indonesia are benefiting from government subsidies that allow them to reduce prices. The U.S. market for the type of uncoated paper involved in the complaint is estimated at $4.5 billion a , according to Domtar Corp., one of the companies calling for duties. In the first nine months of last , imports of such paper from the five countries named were up 40% from a  earlier, even though U.S. demand for it is declining, the companies say. Imports of such paper accounted for more than 16% of the U.S. market in last  first 11 months,  Chip Dillon, a partner at Vertical Research Partners in New York, up from 12.7% a  earlier. As U.S. paper makers have retired old plants, he , importers have rushed in. The Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission will have up to about 14 months to determine whether trade laws have been violated, U.S. producers have been harmed and duties should be levied on the imports. Over the past 15 , U.S. paper makers have persuaded the government to put duties on a variety of products from China and other countries, including tissue paper and some coated paper. The Commerce Department generally has taken a tougher stance against Chinese exporters in dumping disputes in recent ,  William Perry, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney in Seattle. Mr. Perry, who often represents importers in trade cases,  the trend is worsening trade tensions with China, provoking more retaliation. \"We\\'re throwing a rock; they\\'re throwing a rock back,\" he . In addition to Domtar, the companies filing the latest complaint are Packaging Corp. of America, Lake Forest, Ill.; Finch Paper LLC, Glens Falls, N.Y., and P.H. Glatfelter Co., York, Pa. International Paper Co., Memphis, Tenn., declined to participate, a spokesman . He  the company manufactures in 10 countries and relies on the flexibility of a global network. The steelworkers union, which represents about 130,000 paper, pulp and forestry workers in the U.S. and Canada,  eight U.S. paper mills that made uncoated paper have closed or curtailed operations since 2011, eliminating thousands of jobs. Domtar, a Montrealbased company that makes paper in the U.S. and Canada, plans to convert a paper production line in Ashdown, Ark., from uncoated paper to fluff pulp, used in diapers. \"These jobs are too valuable to let go to people who aren\\'t following the same set of rules we are,\"  Jon Geenen, the union international vice president. The U.S. market for uncoated paper has been shrinking 3% to 4% annually in recent  as more documents are handled electronically and companies shave costs,  Mike Garcia, president of Domtar pulpandpaper division. He  the market appeared likely to continue contracting gradually in the next few  but should eventually level off. U.S. imports of uncoated paper in rolls or sheets, a broader category than covered by the trade petition, totaled $2.71 billion in last  first 11 months, while exports came to $1.05 billion, according to Global Trade Information Services.',\n",
       " \"World Trade to Grow 4.7 percent in 2015; U.S. Exports Expected to Rise 5.3 Percent By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 21, 2015 Jan. 20 — Global trade will increase at a moderate 4.7 percent rate in 2015 compared to 3.3 percent in 2014, according to a report published by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). “While this will be an improvement, the ratio of the growth of world trade to that of the [world gross product] will still be only 1.5, not a full recovery to the precrisis trend” of 2 to 1, DESA 2015 World Economic Situation and Prospects report . The continued recession among some of the developed countries in Europe has led to weak import demand that has negatively affected trade flows in developing countries, the report . “Growth of world trade is projected to pick up some momentum from the subdued pace of the past few  in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but the dynamism of the two decades before the crisis may not return soon,” it . Doha Letdown The World Trade Organization scant progress in advancing the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations is “failing to provide new impetus to trade growth,” the report . The WTO 160 members are planning to prepare a work program this  to address the remaining issues of the Bali Ministerial agenda and establish a road map to conclude the Doha Round. The WTO members  they want to address the specific agricultural and development issues that have stalled negotiations over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the proliferation of proposed regional trade agreements (RTAs) “may generate new trade flows in some regions, but the overall effects of RTAs on world trade in the long run are not certain and cannot replace the role of the multilateral trading system,” the report . As of June 2014, some 585 regional trade agreements notifications were made to the WTO, of which 379 were in force. Trade Protectionism Trend The growth of trade protectionist policies stemming from the 2008 financial crisis remains a concern, the report . The Group of Twenty (G20) countries adopted 1,244 traderestrictive measures since October 2008, but only 282 of these had been removed by midOctober 2014, according to WTO data. Between midMay and midOctober 2014, G20 members put in place 93 new traderestrictive measures, the WTO found. “This highlights the importance of renewed global efforts to reduce trade restrictions by refraining from the imposition of new measures and eliminating existing ones,” the DESA report . U.S. Trade Forecast U.S. exports are expected to grow by 5.3 percent in 2015 based on an increased foreign demand for capital goods and industrial supplies, the report . The “substantial strengthening” of U.S. trade projected for this  would build on a “relatively weak” 2.7 percent growth rate in 2014, it . Two other factors likely to affect U.S. trade prospects in 2015 are the “significant” increases in U.S. oil production and the increased value of the dollar versus other global currencies. “The degree to which the rising dollar will have an impact on export growth remains to be seen; it will depend on the level at which exchange rates stabilize as well as the situation among the trading partners,” the report . Regional Trade Analysis Trade in the Russian Federation and the European Union have suffered from the ongoing sanctions stemming from Russia annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, the report . Looking ahead, the risk of geopolitical tension around Ukraine could “further dampen trade prospects if there is a significant flareup or further tightening of sanctions,” it . Trade in developing countries, particularly tourism and commodity exports, have suffered from effects of the Ebola outbreak, terrorist attacks, and domestic and political turmoil, among various African nations. Such trends are expected to reverse in 2015, the report , as North Africa seeks to reach positive export growth, East and Southern Africa experience “continued robust growth” and West African trade improves, the report . Overall, export growth in developing nations is expected to increase from 3.9 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015, the report . Growth in exports among East Asian nations is expected to improve to 4.8 percent in 2015, up from 4.0 percent last . The strong export growth of South Asian economies in 2014 is expected to drop from 8.6 percent to 8.5 percent in 2015. Western Asian economies are expected to have stagnant export growth at 3 percent in 2015, the same as the  prior. The DESA report  trade in Latin America and the Caribbean will be mixed this  with slight improvements in export rates in some countries.\",\n",
       " 'Shoppers bombarded by discounts after franc shock Swissinfo Jan 20, 2015 16:52 Retailers are rushing to offer bargains to Swiss shoppers after a shock surge in the franc, taking advantage of lower import costs but also fearful of losing custom to cheaper rivals over the border in France and Germany. Until last Thursday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had capped the value of the franc at 1.20 per euro. The surprise decision to remove that limit has left the currencies virtually at parity, with one euro buying 1.01 francs on Tuesday. The rise in the franc is expected to have a painful impact on Swiss exports and tourism, but it is a boon for Swiss residents buying imported goods or tempted to shop over the border in eurozone countries – Germany, France, Austria and Italy – and Swiss retailers are scrambling for their custom. Chic clothing store Grieder in Zurich, near the headquarters of banks Credit Suisse and UBS, has knocked a fifth off its prices. Watchmaker Roger Dubuis is lowering prices by up to 6% while rival Audemars Piguet may follow. A new Mercedes has now been discounted by 18% in Switzerland. Rival Audi is also considering an “adjustment” for its Swiss customers. Swiss media say furniture stores, travel agents, supermarkets and petrol stations have all cut prices too. Burgernomics But rather than expecting a sales boom, many retailers may simply be worried about Switzerland haemorrhaging retail demand to the eurozone, where prices have long been cheaper – and just got cheaper still. Even at 1.20, the franc was highly valued compared with before the 2008 economic crisis, when one euro would buy around 1.55 francs. A survey by Deloitte found about 80% of chief financial officers regarded a rate around parity as a disadvantage for their firm, while 1.20 was neutral and 1.30 would help them. At IKEA in Switzerland, a Frostig refrigerator costs CHF1,299. The same model costs €599 across the border in Germany or France. McDonald’s Big Mac costs CHF6.50 in Switzerland, roughly 50% more than in France. For residents of Geneva or Basel, it is little more than a drive across town to take advantage of such discounts. “Companies are barely out of crisis mode, yet now they will need to focus on coming to terms with the appreciation of the franc,”  Michael Grampp, chief economist at Deloitte in Switzerland.',\n",
       " \"Simplifying the Rules of Origin Wasi Ahmed 20 January 2015 The Financial Express (Bangladesh) Bangladesh, Jan. 20 There is, apparently, no debate over the positives from relaxed rules of origin (RoO) on increased exports. The case is more aptly so when it comes to the least developed countries (LDCs) which, for the most part, are constrained to raise their exports to desired levels due to difficulties in complying with RoO norms often found too stringent by such economies. This is precisely why, LDCs have been clamouring on the issue given a chance in the multilateral forum of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Recognised as one of the key tools of market access, the rules meant to determine the origin status of products from exporting countries are not just about tracing where (the country) the products originate from. In respect of the bulk of the natural agricultural and aquatic products, it is the source of origin that fulfils the RoO requirements by way of recognising these as wholly obtained products. But in case of the manufactured products, it is by way of determining the required value addition that constitutes the compliance norms. Depending on the nature and terms of trade agreements among countries bilateral or regional the requirements of the RoO vary. However, because of supplyside constraints in most LDCs, especially in respect of manufactured products requiring inputs from thirdcountry sources, these countries are generally offered comparatively relaxed conditions for their products to qualify for market access and preferential duty in the desired overseas destinations under the Genearlised System of Preferences (GSP) or Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). The reason why RoO features as one of the longdrawn issues of the LDCs is that many of these countries contend that the developed and developing countries alike often resort to using the RoO as protectionist barriers to shield their domestic markets from competition. At a discussion meeting jointly organised by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) and the Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI) in the capital recently on 'Bali Decision on Preferential Rules of Origin for LDCs: Issues for Bangladesh', speakers spoke of RoO as traderestrictive, denying access of the country products to various overseas markets, and called upon the government to team up with the LDC group in a concerted way towards further liberalising and relaxing the qualifying norms under the rules of origin regime. In recognition of the fact that RoO is crucial to the LDC exports, the Committee of Rules of Origin at the WTO reviews the developments time to time in line with proceedings of the global trading practices. The issue came up prominently at the WTO Bali Ministerial. It was agreed there that in line with the WTO Work Programme, subsequent negotiations on RoO will require a proactive engagement on the part of the LDCs. This goes to imply that much of the ongoing demands for simplified and flexible rules of origin will depend on how the LDCs themselves pursue and advance their common cause through future trade negotiations on the matter. Rules of Origin have been under consideration by the WTO since its inception in 1995, but a consensus is yet to be arrived at. The main reason for lack of consensus could well be that different Members of the WTO expect RoO to serve different functions. Now, looking at the issue too simplistically might offer misleading results. True, simplified rules of origin (with no twists to be abused otherwise by importing countries) will immensely benefit LDCs like Bangladesh. In fact, it is the relatively relaxed rules of origin (in the European Union, for example) that has helped countries like us over the past decades to thrive, despite the looming threats to prospects of export growth. Further relaxation of RoO has ramifications that are to be taken into account. There can be no denying that given an environment of minimum value addition, say of 1520 per cent, exports, including of manufactured products, will definitely be easier for many countries. But in the process, there may be little or no expansion in the linkage industries. This is believed to be the general principle governing the whole issue, and truly so. On the other hand, simplification of RoO is not about lowering value addition only. There is a definite need for simplification in other aspects as well as demonstrated in the EU GSP scheme. It has been found that as a fallout of the simplification of the EU GSP, exports from Bangladesh to the EU grew around 16 per cent between 2011 and 2013. It has also helped the growth in the export of diversified products. Given the dynamics governing RoO, there is the definite need for the LDCs to get together in order to firm up their stand on how to go about in future negotiations on the issue for their collective benefit. Bangladesh, needless to say, has a key role to play in this.\",\n",
       " 'Turning 20 marks time for the WTO to grow up Patrick Low South China Morning Post 21 January, 2015 Many would be tempted to say that the World Trade Organisation can only mark, not celebrate, its 20th anniversary this . Shot negotiating deadlines, dashed hopes and endless reiterations of entrenched positions have punctuated the WTO’s two decades of existence with a tedium that has tried even the institution’s strongest supporters. A succession of anni horribiles has pundits wondering “if” the WTO’s multilateral goals can be reached, rather than “when”. Yet no government, or serious commentator for that matter, has suggested that a moribund WTO is an acceptable new normal. The gap between words and deeds has persisted for far too long. One can only hope that repeated assertions of fealty to a system based on universality and inclusiveness is stubborn, if frustrated, realism and not a cynical game of blame and responsibility avoidance. Unlike trade liberalisation, global rulemaking cannot be achieved outside a multilateral setting But to deny the WTO a record of achievement is much too harsh a judgment. For  the institution has tried to sell itself on erroneous grounds instead of playing to its strengths. The greatest achievement of the WTO is not trade liberalisation. That record is restricted largely to a coordinating role in reducing tariffs on manufactured goods among industrial countries over several decades after the second world war. Limited progress has been made in agriculture and services. And the WTO is not the chosen venue for developing and emerging economies to liberalise. The considerable degree of trade openness embraced by these countries in recent decades is understated and uncommitted in the WTO. If 2015 is not going to add to the musty sense of WTO decline, progress is needed on at least three fronts. First, while not excluding itself from trade liberalisation, the WTO should acknowledge more honestly its limitations in that field. It needs to focus more on making and enforcing rules, where it has been far more successful. Moreover, it is there where the WTO can make its unique contribution as a multilateral institution. Unlike trade liberalisation, global rulemaking cannot be achieved outside a multilateral setting. The institution’s  gift to global order and predictability through its work as a rule keeper is usually below the radar. Nearly 20 WTO committees and working parties meet regularly, without ceremony or fanfare, to work through the minutiae of trade policy. These committees do many things. They provide a forum for transparency and nonlitigious exchange. Some committees also play compliance monitoring and review roles. Governments might use them to hint at the possibility of future litigation where they are unhappy with a partner’s policy stance. They help shape opinion and advance mutual understanding. Their work is the lubricant of the system, but rarely considered worthy of media coverage. The WTO should make a lot more of this contribution to trade governance and change perceptions of what it actually does. Second, despite the multiple pronouncements of outside observers that the Doha Round is dead and the WTO should move on, governments are hardwired not to make public acknowledgements of failure. Capitulation would weaken the institution and further corrode credibility. Something has to be done to close the Doha Round, albeit in more modest terms than were initially envisaged in the shadow of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States. This is the greatest immediate challenge. Perhaps the Doha negotiations could be facilitated by engagement on a longer view aimed at updating and completing the content of the WTO’s work. This is the third challenge for 2015. In a world deeply integrated through globalised production and consumption, the WTO needs to move away from the “them and us” focus of many of its rules. The virtual economy, investment and perhaps competition policy are just some of the issues that could receive closer attention. Progress or the lack of it on these matters in the WTO’s 20th  will shape the institution’s fortunes for the next decade. The WTO will hold its 10th ministerial summit in Nairobi, Kenya, in midDecember. The venue is symbolic of change and the future. Will the institution, and above all the governments that populate it, live up to the challenge of looking ahead? Much needs to be done this  for that to happen.

       " \"WTO Chief Urges Members to Focus on Realistic, Precise Goals to Conclude Doha Round By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 22, 2015 Jan. 21 — The top delegates of the World Trade Organization renewed their efforts this week to resolve the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement and conclude the Doha Round of trade negotiations. Members met for two hours on Jan. 21 to discuss their goal of producing a highly developed and precise work program by July 31. The meeting marked a departure from past Doha negotiations in that members appeared to be serious and engaged at a level that had not been seen in , a participant at the meeting told Bloomberg BNA. The meeting represents the first of what will be many among WTO members between now and the July 31 deadline set by members last . The next meeting will be held Jan. 29 in Room W of the WTO building. Sense of Urgency WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo urged members to maintain a sense of urgency in order to avoid getting bogged down in issues that could further delay the development of a detailed work program. “We must maximize the time we have available to us before July—and maintain the momentum that we regained at the end of 2014,” Azevedo told members. Last , India opposition to the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) bogged down the organization work and forced members to extend, by seven months, the deadline to deliver a work program to address the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). It was only after India and the U.S. negotiated a separate agreement related to domestic food security programs that members agreed to seek TFA ratification from their capitals and resume discussions for a postBali work program. Prioritization, ‘Doability.’ Members should prioritize those issues that are of the most substantive importance, target outcomes that are doable for all parties, maintain a high level of engagement and tackle all issues concurrently, Azevedo . “We need to have a detailed, substantive discussion that includes agriculture, nonagricultural market access, services and all of the other DDA issues, including development and issues of interest to LDCs [leastdeveloped countries],” he . Azevedo  that he expects members will primarily focus on issues related to agricultural and nonagricultural market access (NAMA) negotiations, according to Geneva trade officials. Though agriculture cannot be discussed in isolation, it will be the one issue that sets the pace and tone in terms of members' level of ambition, trade officials at the Jan. 21 meeting . 2008 Time Capsule Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke  that the discussions felt like opening up a time capsule from 2008, when the Doha negotiations last faltered. Negotiations broke down in 2008 because emerging and developing countries did not offer sufficient concessions to facilitate an agreement, Punke . In order to move forward, members of large and emerging countries like India and Brazil need to ask themselves what they can do differently from 2008, he . Punke added that trade is at the heart of the U.S. national agenda in 2015 and cited President Barack Obama State of the Union commitment to seek trade promotion authority from Congress in order to better negotiate regional trade agreements. India Ambassador Anjali Prasad  that she had not seen any indication that the U.S. is interested in getting out of a time capsule mode, according to one attendee. India  that the logical starting point for negotiations is consideration of the 2008 revised draft modalities for agriculture, also known as Rev.4, and the 2008 revised draft modalities for NAMA, also known as Rev.3. India further urged members to focus on addressing inequities in the multilateral trade system and to support growth and development, particularly for the poorest nations.\",\n",
       " 'WTO kicks off intensive work to advance Doha POLITICO 1/21/15 5:17 PM EST World Trade Organization members have embarked on an intensive effort to jumpstart the Doha round of negotiations, which has been stalled since 2008. Ambassadors held an informal meeting this morning, the first of many planned highlevel gatherings, to discuss advancing the talks. They will meet next on Jan. 29. The current goal is to develop a socalled “postBali work program,” which aims to provide a roadmap on how to conclude the Doha round. The round would liberalize services, reduce tradedistorting agricultural subsidies and lower tariffs on agricultural and nonagricultural goods. The work program is scheduled to be finished by the end of July. One of the major points of contention the extent to which emerging economies like China, India and Brazil will take on more ambitious disciplines, according to diplomatic sources in Geneva. The Doha round is already designed to have those nations take on more ambitious commitments than other developing countries. But WTO members will have to agree how similar those disciplines should be to the commitments of rich economies like the United States and the European Union. One Genevabased source  it would be useful in developing the work program to understand the scope of exceptions that will be sought by various countries. For example, it probably wouldn’t be politically feasible for the U.S. to cut agricultural subsidies below what is allowed in the new farm bill, the source . Countries will also have to agree on how much to excise from the 2008 texts that failed to garner agreement. — Victoria Guida',\n",
       " 'United States says trade holdouts can\\'t keep global deals hostage WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) New world trade talks had to level the playing field between developed and developing economies on farm support and avoid being held hostage by countries unwilling to open markets, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in an opinion piece to be published on Thursday. As a group of World Trade Organization members prepares to meet in the Swiss resort of Davos to discuss the 2015 agenda, Froman called for \"soulsearching\" about the next steps for the 20old institution, which late last  clinched the first global deal in its history. In an opinion piece to be published on Reuters, Froman  success in cutting customs red tape, which was hardwon after strong opposition from India, could be a \"brief blip\" unless countries could start afresh on the broader Doha round agenda, which seeks to lower trade barriers and set common rules in a range of areas. Officials had to consider the \"tectonic shifts\" in the global economy as emerging markets gained economic muscle, while avoiding double standards in giving emerging markets easier treatment on agricultural subsidies, and ask whether a small group of trade laggards should dictate the agenda, he . \"Put simply, many of the Doha Round primary goals will remain inconceivable as long as a subgroup of countries are dogmatically opposed to the whole concept of liberalization,\" he . The Doha Development Round, launched in 2001, was originally meant to help developing economies and was strongly supported by India, Brazil and China. A deal to cut tariffs on information technology products has been held up because of opposition by China and South Korea. Doha negotiations have effectively been on hold since 2008, giving way to smaller, piecemeal deals and discussions of \"plurilateral\" agreements forging coalitions of the willing rather than those that include all WTO members. Bilateral and regional agreements outside the WTO, such as the TransPacific Partnership the United States is pursuing with 11 other trading partners, have also proliferated. Froman  the United States still wanted an ambitious Doha deal, opening markets to manufactured goods and services and discussing the \"full array\" of farm trade issues, but it was possible not all members would be on board. \"In that event, a more focused and tailored agenda, one that is balanced to reflect the world we all live in today, could present an alternative path forward,\" he . \"While no country should be subject to obligations without its consent, we cannot allow a small group of countries to hold back all those who are prepared to move forward.\" His comments could open the door to cutting some countries out of agreements one option discussed during the standoff last  with India over customs reform or to diluting goals for agreements covering all members. Froman  the United States was prepared to pick up the thorny issue of support for domestic agricultural production and exports, but only if emerging markets did the same. A proposal in 2008 was for developed countries to cut subsidies while developing countries did not but Froman  such a \"double standard\" made no sense in a global market.',\n",
       " 'WTO talks: India says won\\'t accept attempts to introduce differentiation D. Ravi Kanth 22 January 2015 Mint Geneva, Jan. 22 India says it will not accept any attempts by rich nations to introduce \"differentiation\" among developing countries as a \"gateway\" issue for attempts to conclude the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations this . The India position was stated by its Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Anjali Prasad at a closeddoor meeting of trade envoys on Wednesday, according to several participants familiar with the meeting who declined to be named. WTO directorgeneral Roberto Azevedo signalled his intention to finalize a clear work programme with precise modalities by endJuly to conclude the Doha trade negotiations at the upcoming 10th ministerial conference in Nairobi, Kenya, by the end of this . Modalities, in trade jargon, imply reduction commitments in tariffs and subsidies in agriculture and tariff cuts in industrial products. The Doha trade negotiations, aimed at laying down the rules of world trade, were launched in 2001 in Doha, Qatar, and ought to have been concluded by end2004. But the talks have remained deadlocked since 2008 because of fierce opposition from the US to what are called the 2008 revised draft modalities in agriculture and industrial goods. The modalities provided clear benchmarks for reduction of tradedistorting domestic subsidies and export subsidies and export credits, an architecture of commitments for industrialized and developing countries to reduce farm tariffs, including special products and special safeguard mechanism to ward off unforeseen surges in imports of agricultural products and a formula with flexibilities to reduce industrial tariffs for developing countries. A large majority of developing countries, including India, want the 2008 modalities to conclude the Doha trade negotiations. Developing countries reiterated their demand at the closeddoor meeting. The envoy for the US, which remains opposed to the 2008 modalities, asked whether WTO members, particularly emerging economies, have moved away from the socalled time capsule of 2008, or stick to the same benchmarks. The US sought to know whether emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, and Argentina are willing to undertake higher commitments in agriculture and industrial goods. The US  Washington never accepted the 2008 revised draft modalities because emerging economies were not prepared to accept ambitious cuts in agriculture and industrial goods commensurate with what the envoy described as their status in the global trading system. In response to the US demand that emerging economies undertake higher commitments to conclude the Doha trade negotiations, India WTO ambassador Prasad maintained that the outcome in the Doha negotiations will not be determined on what the emerging economies are going to pay. She underscored the need to address the inequities and imbalances in the global trading system which arose from the previous Uruguay Round, according to trade envoys familiar with the meeting. The European Union, Norway and Switzerland also wanted the emerging countries to pay more because of what they called the changed realities in the global trading system. Several developing and least developed countries also demanded that the goal posts of the socalled Doha Development Round must not be altered.',\n",

The meeting is scheduled for Jan. 26 and will be overseen by Committee Chairman Ambassador Pierre Claver Ndayiragije of Burundi. The purpose of the meeting is to allow members “to see where we are in our work in relation to the CTD mandate on trade and development stemming from the Eighth Ministerial Conference,” according to an unofficial committee document authored by Ndayiragije. “In this regard, a number of proposals from members remain on the table,” it . The WTO Eighth Ministerial Conference in 2011 acknowledged the link between trade and development and urged members to “fully operationalize” the mandate of the committee as a focal point for development work. Preferential Trade Arrangements The committee plans to discuss its ongoing review of the Transparency Mechanism for Preferential Trade Arrangements (PTAs), the unofficial document . The goal of the mechanism is to enhance the transparency of PTAs under consideration by requiring members to publish on the Internet the full text of the PTA legislation and any related instruments. “In particular, after the overview I provided last November of the status of implementation of the Transparency Mechanism, I would welcome any suggestions from members about ways forward on this issue,” Ndayiragije wrote. The WTO CTD handles notifications of preferential arrangements among developing countries. PTAs are generally considered to be nonreciprocal preferential schemes that are distinct from regional trade agreements.

       " 'Taiwan to take legal challenge to WTO over Canada steel dumping duties (By Milly Lin and Ted Chen) Taipei, Jan. 21 (CNA) Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Wednesday that it will take a legal challenge to the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Canada for levying antidumping duties on steel exports, a move expected within two day time. The action marks the first time Taiwan has been a sole plaintiff in a challenge lodged via the Genevabased body. Due in part to its diplomatic isolation, Taiwan efforts in securing bilateral and multilateral trade agreements have suffered setbacks amid growing protectionism following the global financial crisis of 2008. Antidumping probes in particular have been a tactic taken against Taiwanese exports. Taiwan last June launched a WTO challenge against Canada over what it deemed irregular antidumping investigatory practices on the part of Canada. In accordance with WTO regulations, the two countries conducted bilateral consultation as an initial stage of formal dispute settlement, but efforts since then have not yielded an accord. About US$14 million in trade revenues is at stake, according to Jack Hsiao (???), a negotiator from the Economics Ministry Office of Trade Negotiations. Ministry statistics show that following the sanctions, revenues from steel exports to Canada plummeted from the US$19 million recorded in 2011 to US$11 million in 2012 and around US$5 million in 2013. If victorious in its legal challenge, Taiwan would create profound spillover effects for other ongoing cases such as Canada other antidumping duties levied against Taiwanese oil country tubular goods and metal screws and nuts, worth about US$10 million in revenue, according to Hsiao. The negotiator  that when Taiwan ran into similar disputes with India, it avoided fullblown legal challenges as the two nations were able to reach an accord during the initial bilateral consultation phase. Court hearings in the Canada case may begin as early as March or April, with a court decision possible by the end of this  or early in 2016. Hsiao, however,  that Canada would be able to file for an appeal that would delay a conclusion in the case for up to two .

According to Enrico Brivio, the spokesperson for Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European commissioner for health and food safety, the upshot of this contact should enable “the resumption, for some [agricultural] products,” of European exports to Russia. Work is under way on how these arrangements can be implemented. In February 2014, Moscow declared an embargo on European pork the official reason being the discovery of several cases of African swine fever in dead boar in Lithuania and Poland. The EU appealed to the WTO against this embargo. Since August 2014, Russia has also been applying an embargo on numerous other European foods (meat, fruit and vegetables, milk) amid the Ukrainian conflict.

As well as holding bilateral talks, the leaders of the world two largest democracies will address CEOs, appear on a radio phonein and watch a spectacular parade together in a visit that underscores their closeness. The US president and wife Michelle will also travel to the Taj Mahal, with hundreds of photographers on hand to snap the first couple visit to the ultimate monument to love. Obama courtship of Prime Minister Modi is evident from his threeday itinerary, the first time an incumbent president has returned to India. While recent swings through Asia have included multiple stopovers, India is Obama only destination this time, despite the risk of offending neighbouring Pakistan. \"There no question this is a defining time in the USIndia relationship,\" US Ambassador Richard Verma  in New Delhi Wednesday. \"Things not only feel different, they are different.\" Modi election in May 2014 was a potential headache for the US, which had blacklisted the Hindu nationalist for more than a decade after deadly communal riots in Gujarat when he was state chief minister. He was only brought in from the cold last February when Verma predecessor travelled to Gujarat once it appeared Modi was likely to end the centreleft Congress party 10 rule. The transformation since has been spectacular, with both men heartened by their meeting of minds on a range of issues in Washington in September. The US website Politico described their summit as a \"lovein\" and predicted Modi could become \"America new best buddy\". Modi November invitation \"to have a friend over\" was issued via Twitter and Obama quickfire acceptance underlined a sense of coordination. One cloud was lifted in November when the two governments resolved a row over food subsidies that had been blocking a global trade agreement. Obama top diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry, even called Modi a \"visionary\" on an advance visit last week. Obama will be the main VIP at Monday Republic Day parade when India military showcases everything from tanks to its camels. \"For President Obama to be invited as the first US president to attend as the chief guest sends a very  message to the world,\" US Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters in Washington. \"There is extraordinary potential in this relationship... Our goal is to lead this relationship in a fundamentally different place than it was when President Obama took office and when Prime Minister Modi took office. \"We believe we have a unique moment of opportunity to have that type of breakthrough.\" Observers are not expecting major policy announcements, although a deal on intelligence sharing is on the cards and decadeold defence cooperation pact is expected to be upgraded. \"I think strengthening our ties with US, with the already existing framework enhancing its scope, is definitely beneficial to the country,\" Defence Minister Manohar Parikar told India television. Speaking at a conference organised by the Brookings India thinktank, former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal  there were unlikely to be other big breakthroughs in Sunday talks as \"we have not given ourselves enough time since September.\" Climate change and Afghanistan are expected issues on the agenda, while particular focus will be on the economy after Modi pledged to make India \"the easiest place\" to do business. Obama and Modi will make a joint address to company bosses on Monday in an event organised by the USIndia Business Council. \"With business sentiment at an alltime high, the timing could not be better,\"  the organisation acting head Diane Farrell. US Ambassador Verma  bilateral trade was now running at around 100 billion dollars a  five times the level of a decade ago and saw no reason it couldn\\'t grow by another five times. Officials in Washington have admitted a certain degree of surprise over the upswing in ties. The rapid escalation of a row over the stripsearch of an India diplomat in New York in late 2013 which saw the Stars and Stripes torched on the streets of Delhi hinted at a latent antiAmerican sentiment in a country that still sees Russia as its most reliable ally. But both sides share a common goal in wanting a counterbalance to China, even if President Xi Jinping beat Obama to a Modi invite.

       " 'Michael Froman: Twenty  in and bogged down, what’s the way forward for the WTO? By Michael Froman January 22, 2015 Financial Times Blogs Having marked its 20th anniversary earlier this month, the World Trade Organization must move quickly from celebrating to soulsearching when some of its members convene in Switzerland this week. Hanging in the balance are negotiations that began in 2001, and if approached with a new perspective, could boost global growth. To be sure, there is one recent achievement that is worth toasting: the Trade Facilitation Agreement. By streamlining customs procedures, that agreement could add hundreds of billions of dollars to the global economy, with developing economies gaining the most. But this is the first and only deal that all WTO members have signed during the organization’s twodecades of existence. Whether it represents a brief blip or the beginning of broader trend toward enhanced cooperation and greater gains for the global economy depends on the answer to three tough questions. First, can we update our discussions to reflect the realities of today’s global economy? The current negotiations, known as the “Doha Round,” began in 2001 and haven’t kept pace with tectonic shifts in the global economy, most notably the rise of the emerging economies. Take the example of agriculture, the subsidies for which have proven one of the toughest issues to tackle. In 2008, the proposed solution was that developed countries would cut their agricultural subsidies while developing countries would not. But much has changed since that time. Just last , a group representing agricultureexporting countries, developed and developing alike, published a report listing the top four users of tradedistorting agricultural subsidies in today’s world, with India first, followed by China, the European Union, and the United States. In a global commodities market, this doublestandard makes no economic sense. In reality, tradedistorting subsidies from emerging economies have the same impact on global commodity prices as tradedistorting subsidies from developed countries. The United States is willing to wade back into the complex thicket of agricultural trade negotiations, but only if the discussion reflects today’s reality. Second, what’s the best way to support development? As President Obama has made clear, the United States believes that sustainable development is ultimately grounded in trade and investment. That’s why the administration is working hard to secure seamless renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is the cornerstone of U.S. trade policy with subSaharan Africa. Not everyone agrees that trade and investment are central to development, and there is a sharp debate on this issue among developing countries themselves. Some of the most successful developing economies are pursuing a range of market opening initiatives, including reducing or eliminating their tariffs. Others stand in staunch opposition to further liberalization and have even raised new barriers to trade and investment. We need a debate about trade, investment, and development in Geneva that is just as robust as the debate among developing countries. Put simply, many of the Doha Round’s primary goals will remain inconceivable as long as a subgroup of countries are dogmatically opposed to the whole concept of liberalization. Third, can we handle the truth? Depending on the answers to the questions above, the United States can still envision an ambitious outcome to the Doha Round. Certainly, this is the outcome we seek. But if the debate over the next few weeks makes it apparent that others will not support an ambitious outcome – in opening markets to manufactured goods, services, as well as the full array of agricultural issues – the time has come to deal with that reality. In that event, a more focused and tailored agenda, one that is balanced to reflect the world we all live in today, could present an alternative path forward. While no country should be subject to obligations without its consent, we cannot allow a small group of countries to hold back all those who are prepared to move forward. As the Doha Round has dragged on, devolving into stalemate, many countries have logically explored alternatives for achieving results. In the absence of further progress on the multilateral front, the trend toward bilateral, regional, and other initiatives will surely intensify and, if done right, can add momentum to the multilateral system itself. One way or another, the time has come for the WTO to move forward. Those who care about promoting sustainable development must not only act, but also take on responsibility commensurate with their current role in the global economy. At a time of uneven global economic growth and uncertainty, we cannot afford to squander more .',\n",
       " 'The grain mountain Our Editorial 22 January 2015 Business Standard India’s foodgrain policy takes some steps forward The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved a revised buffer stocking policy for foodgrain which, even while requiring holding of higher strategic food reserves than stipulated earlier, nevertheless provides a window for shedding excess stock — through domestic sales and exports. The central grain pool, according to the new norms, should have 41.1 million tonnes of rice and wheat on July 1 and 30.7 million tonnes on October 1 every . These limits were, respectively, 32 million tonnes and 21 million tonnes earlier. The stocking norms for the quarters beginning January 1 and April 1 have been altered only marginally. The food ministry has been authorised to dispose of any surplus stock through open sale in the domestic market or export without seeking the Union Cabinet’s approval. This marks a welcome departure from the earlier practice of maintaining excessive, unmanageable and fiscally burdensome food inventories created by purchasing all the grain on offer at the minimum support price. Under this system, the government had ended up buying, on average, 33 per cent of the rice and 30.4 per cent of the wheat produced in the country between 200809 and 201314. Besides bloating the food subsidy bill to unsustainable levels – the carrying cost of each tonne of foodgrain works out to nearly ~5,000 at current prices – this had seriously distorted the country’s food market. The new policy can iron out these distortions, restore the relevance of private trade in the food sector and rein in food inflation by augmenting grain supplies in the open market. The old buffer limits were fixed almost a decade ago when the requirement of foodgrain for the public distribution system (PDS) was lower. However, after the enactment of the National Food Security Act, 2013, which seeks to provide 5 kg of foodgrain every month to some twothirds of the country’s entire population at highly subsidised rates, this requirement has risen sharply. When this law becomes fully operational – at present it is being implemented only in 11 states – the annual foodgrain requirement for PDS and welfare schemes may swell to over 61 million tonnes. This apart, changes in the food stocking policy and an increase in the size of the needed grain reserves have become necessary also to enable India to show better compliance with the public stockholding norms for food security laid down by the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). New Delhi is also seeking an amendment in the grain stockholding and food subsidy caps stipulated in the AoA. However, the anticipated gains from the new policy will accrue only if it is implemented earnestly and is supported by more reforms in food management. Though the government has already taken some steps – such as discouraging states from offering bonus on top of the minimum support price – to reduce needless acquisition of foodgrain for the central grain kitty, but these alone may not suffice. The current practice of openended food procurement, which is the root cause for excessive stock accumulation, may need to be curbed by making a distinction between procurement and market support operations. Otherwise, food sector reforms may remain incomplete. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'USTR Froman Says WTO Faces Do or Die Moment During Doha Round Negotiations By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 23, 2015 Jan. 22 — U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman urged members of the World Trade Organization to seek an “ambitious outcome” to the Doha Round or risk unraveling the multilateral trade liberalization effort. “Many of the Doha Round primary goals will remain inconceivable as long as a subgroup of countries are dogmatically opposed to the whole concept of liberalization,” Froman wrote in a recent blog post. “In the absence of further progress on the multilateral front, the trend toward bilateral, regional, and other initiatives will surely intensify,” Froman . Froman blunt assessment of the state of the 2001 Doha Round of trade negotiations comes as WTO members consider a way forward against the backdrop of U.S. free trade deal talks in Asia and Europe. July 31 Deadline The U.S. will join delegates from more than 30 WTO members at a “miniministerial” meeting on Jan. 24 in Davos, Switzerland, aimed at resolving the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement and the Doha Round. In November, WTO members separately agreed to ratify the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) and produce a detailed work program for the postBali agenda by July 31. Between now and then WTO representatives in Geneva will meet regularly at informal heads of delegation and trade negotiation committee meetings to achieve the July 31 goal. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo asked members during a Jan. 21 “Room W” meeting to quickly seek actionable and realistic goals that address issues related to agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services. India and U.S. delegates at the meeting traded barbs about whether members are truly interested in departing from the 2008era disagreements that hindered progress on the Doha Round negotiations (14 WTO, 1/22/15). Agricultural Subsidies Froman criticized developing nations like China and India for seeking outdated trade goals, particularly with respect to agricultural subsidies, according to his blog post. The 2008 revised draft modalities for agriculture, also known as Rev.4, no longer make sense in a world where India and China have become the top two users of tradedistorting agricultural subsidies, Froman . “In 2008, the proposed solution was that developed countries would cut their agricultural subsidies while developing countries would not,” Froman . “But much has changed since that time.” “Tradedistorting subsidies from emerging economies have the same impact on global commodity prices as tradedistorting subsidies from developed countries,” Froman . “The United States is willing to wade back into the complex thicket of agricultural trade negotiations, but only if the discussion reflects today reality,” he wrote. Plurilateral Progress If WTO members are unable to advance trade negotiations related to manufactured goods, services and agricultural issues, willing members will seek a “more focused and tailored agenda,” Froman wrote. “While no country should be subject to obligations without its consent, we cannot allow a small group of countries to hold back all those who are prepared to move forward,” he . Prior to the November TFA agreement, the U.S. and EU had considered adopting trade facilitation rules on a plurilateral basis in line with the terms of the Information Technology Agreement. Froman comments indicate that members may now consider alternative agriculture, NAMA and service agreements outside of the WTO multilateral umbrella. The U.S. is negotiating broad free trade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The conclusion of these deals may accelerate if the U.S. Congress grants President Barack Obama increased trade promotion authority via legislation.

       " 'Global trade won\\'t return to precrisis levels, says Maersk CEO By Christian Oliver in Brussels 22 January 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) The chief executive of the world biggest shipping group has warned that global trade will never return to scorching precrisis growth rates, in part because western companies are looking to manufacture more goods closer to home. Nils Andersen of AP MøllerMaersk  that many of the world most  trade routes were suffering from a crippling over capacity because shipping lines were holding out in vain for the return of a precrisis golden era, which had been fuelled by spectacular growth in Asia and Latin America. \"Before, [trade growth] used to be doubledigit globally, but we don\\'t see that coming back. Four to 5 per cent is a realistic longterm trend. Provided the capacity is adjusted, this is a nice market to be in,\" he  in an interview with the Financial Times. \"It only when shipping companies have been investing, hoping that the good old days will come back, that we have had issues. And the good old days will most likely not come back,\" he added. Denmark Maersk, which carries 15 per cent of seaborne trade, is the most profitable container line and stands out in an industry that has been severely undermined by over capacity during 2013 and 2014. Of the 13 rivals that Maersk tracks, it says 10 were lossmaking in the first half of last . Mr Andersen  that shifts in trade patterns from Asia would have a particularly significant impact on container ships, which carry 90 per cent of all trade in goods. Rather than depending on manufacturing in Asia, western European companies were moving production to eastern Europe and US companies were investing either at home or in Mexico. \"You already have a lot of rescoring or nearshoring taking place,\" he . He also made the observation that the consumer goods western countries most wanted from Asia particularly electronics were rapidly declining in size and required less container space. While trade from Asia to Europe had still grown a \"healthy\" 6 per cent last , he cautioned that the industry had to steel itself for continuing falls in freight rates over the coming . \"We plan on a gradual decline in rates over time and then you make your cost adjustments,\" he . Overall, he predicted that global trade would grow a \"rather sluggish\" 4 per cent this , a similar level to 2014. This chimed with the outlook from the World Trade Organisation, which has revised down its growth forecast to 4 per cent from an earlier estimate of 5.2 per cent. Last week, China announced that its trade with the rest of the world grew only 3.4 per cent over 2014, undershooting a national target of 7.5 per cent for a third consecutive . By contrast, between 2005 and 2012, China exports grew an average of 14 per cent annually, while imports grew 15 per cent, according to the WTO. Mr Andersen  the worsening crisis over Russia and Ukraine represented the biggest strategic concern for shipping lines. He denied that the conflict was a net gain for the shipping industry, even though Russia was looking further afield to buy commodities after banning EU food imports. \"It may occasionally be quite good for shipping because the further you go away for your supplies, the better for us, but, in general, this is a negative trend. This is a regrettable situation,\" he . \"We have uncertainties in our relationship with a big supplier of energy to global markets. This is not a good situation.\"',\n",
       " 'ECB launches 1 trillion euro rescue plan to revive euro economy * ECB launches bondbuying programme with new money * Amounts to 60 bln euros a month together with existing schemes * Programme to run until endSeptember 2016 * National central banks to shoulder bulk of risk * Euro tumbles in response By Jonathan Gould and John O\\'Donnell FRANKFURT, Jan 22 (Reuters) The European Central Bank took the ultimate policy leap on Thursday, launching a government bondbuying programme which will pump hundreds of billions in new money into a sagging euro zone economy. The ECB  it would purchase sovereign debt from this March until the end of September 2016, despite opposition from Germany Bundesbank and concerns in Berlin that it could allow spendthrift countries to slacken economic reforms. Together with existing schemes to buy private debt and funnel hundreds of billions of euros in cheap loans to banks, the new quantitative easing programme will release 60 billion euros ($68 billion) a month into the economy, ECB President Mario Draghi . By September next , more than 1 trillion euros will have been created under quantitative easing, the ECB last remaining major policy option for reviving economic growth and warding off deflation. The flood of money impressed markets: the euro fell more than two U.S. cents to $1.14108 on the announcement, and European shares hit seven highs. \"All eyes were on Mario Draghi and he has delivered a bigger bazooka than investors were expecting,\"  Mauro Vittorangeli, a fixed income specialist at Allianz Global Investors, adding that the news marked \"an historic crossroads for European markets\". The ECB and the central banks of euro zone countries will buy up bonds in proportion to its \"capital key\", meaning more debt will be scooped up from the biggest economies such as Germany than from small member states such as Ireland. The prospect of dramatic ECB action had already prompted the Swiss central bank to abandon its cap on the franc against the euro. Denmark cut its main policy interest rate on Thursday for the second time this week after the ECB announcement, aiming to defend the Danish crown peg to the euro. Draghi has had to balance the need for action to lift the euro zone economy out of its torpor against German concerns about risksharing and that it might be left to foot the bill. WILL IT WORK? Economists noted that Draghi had  only 20 percent of purchases would be the responsibility of the ECB. This means the bulk of any potential losses, should a euro zone government default on its debt, would fall on national central banks. Critics say this casts doubt over the unity of the euro zone and its principle of solidarity, and countries with already high debts could find themselves in yet deeper water. \"It is counterproductive to shift the risks of monetary policy to the national central banks,\"  former ECB policymaker Athanasios Orphanides. \"It does not promote a single monetary policy. This path towards Balkanisation of monetary policy would signal that the ECB is preparing for a breakup of the euro.\" A German lawyer who has been prominent in attempts to halt euro zone bailouts  he was already preparing a legal complaint against the bondbuying programme. Draghi  the ECB Governing Council had been unanimous in agreeing that the step to print money was legally sound. There was a large majority on the need to trigger it now, \"so large that we didn\\'t need to take a vote\". \"There was a consensus on risksharing set at 20 percent and 80 percent on a norisksharing basis,\" he added. One euro zone central banking source  five policymakers opposed the expanded assetpurchase plan: the central bank chiefs of Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Estonia, along with Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger, a German. Guntram Wolff, head of the Bruegel think tank,  the plan size was impressive. \"But the ECB has given the signal ... that its monetary policy is not a single one. That a bad signal to markets and a bad signal to everybody in the euro zone.\" The ECB is trying to push euro zone annual inflation back up to its target of just below two percent; consumer prices fell last month, raising fears of a Japanesestyle deflationary spiral. But there are doubts, and not only in Germany, over whether printing fresh money will work. Most euro zone government bond yields are at ultralow levels and the euro had already dropped sharply against the dollar. Lower borrowing costs and a weaker currency could both help to boost economic growth but there is a question about how much further either can fall. The ECB could create the basis for growth, Draghi , but he put the onus on governments to follow. \"For growth to pick up ... you need structural reforms,\" he . \"It now up to the governments to implement these structural reforms. The more they do, the more effective will be our monetary policy.\" Draghi was echoing the view of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who : \"Regardless of what the ECB does, it should not obscure the fact that the real growth impulses must come from conditions set by the politicians.\" The ECB has already cut interest rates to record lows and left its refinancing rate, which determines the cost of euro zone credit, at 0.05 percent. Greece and Cyprus, which remain under EU/IMF bailout programmes, will be eligible for the ECB programme but subject to stricter conditions. In practice, Greek debt does not currently qualify as another rule stipulates that a maximum 33 percent of the bonds issued by any country may be bought. The ECB and other euro zone central banks already own more than this, although they may start purchases once enough of their Greek bonds have matured to take the total below the 33 percent threshold. Greece votes on Sunday in an election where antibailout opposition party Syriza is on track to emerge as the biggest party in parliament. ($1 = 0.8752 euros) (Writing by Mike Peacock and Paul Carrel.

After a vote, the U.S. International Trade Commission announced that PV products from China mainland and Taiwan had impaired the U.S. PV industry and it decided to levy a tax on these products. The MOC  the vote and investigation on Chinese PV products had ignored and disobeyed the WTO rules. The U.S has abused its power with the Trade Remedy Laws, caused losses for Chinese enterprises and American customers and hindered global cooperation in new energy, the MOC . The ministry urged the American side to follow the rules and adopt proper and responsible measures to cope with trade frictions China is considering safeguarding its rights under the WTO framework and American judicial system, the MOC added.',\n",
       " 'China says US tyre duty ruling has \\'multiple flaws\\' 23 January 2015 Agence France Presse A US ruling slapping heavy duties on Chinese tyres was flawed, Beijing , urging Washington to handle the case \"prudently\". The US Commerce Department on Wednesday announced a preliminary judgement levying antidumping duties of between 19.17 and 87.99 percent on car and lighttruck tyres made in China. A final decision is due in June. Dumping occurs when a product is sold in a foreign market at less than its domestic price or cost of production. China commerce ministry responded that the ruling had \"multiple flaws\" and the government is \"seriously concerned\". \"Data showed that the US domestic tyre producers have good profits and imported products from China did not cause harm to the US domestic industry,\" an unnamed ministry official  in a statement late Thursday. Chinese tyres have previously had punitive tariffs imposed on them by the US, for three  from 2009. The rate started at 35 percent and was reduced by five percentage points each . Those duties \"caused severe harm to ChinaUS trade relations\", the official  in the statement. \"(We) hope the US will draw a lesson from that and handle this case in a prudent way to avoid once again undermining cooperation between the two countries\\' relevant industries and generating unharmonious elements for ChinaUS trade,\"  the official. The US ruling came on the same day a trade panel cleared the way for duties on certain solar cell products made in China and Taiwan allegedly being unfairly subsidised and dumped.',\n",
       " 'Market status for China is \\'political\\' issue Niu Yue in New York 23 January 2015 China DailyUS Edition China marketeconomy status, which is vital in antidumping investigations, is more political than economic, according to an attorney who represents Chinese enterprises and American importers in antidumping cases in the United States. \"This is a political decision,\" William Perry, partner of Dorsey and Whitney LLP,  Wednesday during a seminar on ChinaUS trade disputes at Brooklyn Law School. \"Understand that. That the reality.\" Perry has been representing Chinese exporters and manufacturers in antidumping cases since 1991 and has worked with the International Trade Commission and the US Department of Commerce (DOC). The comment comes at a time of heated debate on whether China will be automatically recognized as a market economy. China agreed that other members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) could regard it as a \"nonmarket economy\" for 15  from Dec 11, 2001, as a condition of joining the WTO in 2001. As the deadline of Dec 11, 2016, draws near, there have been disputes on whether China would be automatically recognized by other WTO members, based on different understandings of China accession agreement. China has been negotiating with other WTO members one by one to win market economy status before 2016. Dozens of countries, including Russia, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore, have granted China that status. Meanwhile, some of China major trading partners, including the US and the European Union (EU), have not, saying that China has not met their criteria. \"Some of the bigger problems with China right now [are] the extensive industrial planning in China,\"  Christopher Cloutier, partner of King & Spalding LLP, which filed and prosecuted the first successful antisubsidy case against China in 2007. \"There are some elements that are not very marketoriented, for example, preventing foreign ownership,\" he , citing an industrial plan to develop China iron and steel industry. But Perry insisted the issue is more political, giving Russia and Ukraine as two examples. Russia and Ukraine won US recognition, respectively, in 2002, after the Afghan War, and in 2006 after the Orange Revolution. If a country regards China as a nonmarket economy, investigators will not use prices in China to calculate whether Chinese exporters are dumping, as prices in China are considered governmentcontrolled and do not reflect the actual cost of production. Instead, investigators will turn to a surrogate country with a marketeconomy status as a reference. The practice could \"provide countless distortions that affect the final dumping margin,\" wrote K. William Watson, trade analyst with Cato Institute, in a report. It also left Chinese firms unable of knowing what the normal value is until the DOC gets a result through surrogate values, making it difficult to avoid antidumping duties, according to the report. China, if recognized as a market economy, may not see a decline in trade disputes, because \"there is no reason to believe people file cases because China is a nonmarket economy,\"  Cloutier. However, he  Chinese companies would be confident of more fairness in trade disputes because China own data would be used. \"Ultimately, I think China will litigate this, if the US government practice continues,\"  Thomas Lee, a law professor with Fordham University. \"They will definitely litigate it before the WTO, and the likelihood is that they will probably win before the appellate body.\" Perry agreed that China eventually will receive marketeconomy status from the US.',\n",
       " 'Modipicked panel wants India to get nimble on grains exports By Mayank Bhardwaj and Ratnajyoti Dutta NEW DELHI, Jan 22 (Reuters) India needs to become more nimble in allowing wheat and rice exports from overstocked government silos if it wants to cut waste and get the best price for its grains, a panel appointed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommended. Despite stocks that are often more than double the government target, India exports only about 10 percent of its wheat and rice output of 195 million tonnes. The Food Corporation of India (FCI), a government behemoth set up 60  ago after acute food shortages forced India to import, sits on mounds of rice and wheat thanks to bumper harvests since 2007. \"Because of bureaucracy, we take a long time to agree on exports and market dynamics change by then, thwarting our efforts to make the best out of attractive prices abroad,\" Shanta Kumar, chief of the panel,  after unveiling the report on Thursday. Currently the government takes a call on exports and local sales after a lengthy consultation process. The panel would like the FCI to abolish regional offices, focus on key states for procurement, invest in computerisation and bring in technical and managerial expertise from the private sector. \"A nimblefooted FCI will help us earn precious foreign exchange and save a lot of money that is blocked in terms of extra grains stocks that is prone to pest attack and wastage,\"  Ashok Gulati, a noted economist and a member of the panel. Modi, who formed the panel in August to suggest an overhaul of India theftprone food distribution network, has asked the food ministry to examine the recommendations before acting on the report. India, the world biggest rice and wheat producer after China, runs a mammoth $18.64 billion food welfare programme. But nearly half of the ultracheap rice and wheat meant for the poor is either wasted or stolen, according to various experts. The panel also suggested the government scale down its food distribution programme by covering only 40 percent of the population, instead of 67 percent. However, it favoured a higher monthly allocation of 7 kg per person against 5 kg now. Lowering the number of beneficiaries could save India 330 billion rupees ($5.35 billion) a  in subsidies,  Kumar, a former food minister. But the move could potentially anger millions of voters enjoying cheap grains and would require the approval of India partisan parliament. \"It not an easy task to reduce the level of beneficiaries as a host of procedural hurdles will have to be crossed before accepting the latest recommendations,\"  B.C.

       " 'India to put restrictions on import of US chicken legs Dilasha Seth 23 January 2015 The Economic Times NEW DELHI: India is set to tighten norms for imports of American chicken legs by proposing to keep out frozen chicken older than six months and those that have consumed hormones or genetically modified feed as the country prepares to contest a WTO order to lift a ban on purchases of US poultry. The new standards, which may kick in within six months, could offer some protection to the growing domestic poultry industry from competitively priced American chicken legs. While the India industry will also have to meet these food safety norms, being brought in as part of the government’s quality initiative, it has an advantage since it largely consists of fresh poultry and does not rely on GM feed. The World Trade Organization asked India in October to lift a ban on American chicken, imposed on account of avian influenza in 2007, calling it ‘unscientific’ and noncompliant with the global trade body’s rules. India will challenge the WTO order in the appellate body in a couple of days, citing domestic food safety concerns. The new import norms are being prepared by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India in consultation with the department of commerce and the department of animal husbandry, dairying & fisheries. “We are working out standards for poultry and are discussing banning the sale of chicken older than six months. Also, poultry must not be fed with genetically modified feed, growth hormones and antibiotics,” a government official . US frozen chicken legs are stored for about four to five  and its poultry consume growth hormones and GM feed, a significant concern in India. FSSAI has put out a draft order for meat and poultry products, inviting public comments. It has proposed that poultry birds should not be given feed containing meat, bone and blood. Besides, the use of antibiotics in feed and growth hormones will not be allowed. It also  that slaughtering or processing of bovine meat will be prohibited where poultry meat is produced for human consumption. “The order will come into effect from July 2015,” FSSAI  in the draft order. US consumers prefer chicken breasts and the lessfavoured legs are frozen for export to other markets at highly competitive prices. Chicken legs, which are popular in India, are priced locally at about Rs 150170 per kg, while the US sells them at Rs 4050 per kg. The FSSAI will work with the department of animal husbandry to modify health certificates for meat and poultry sold to India. “It will require competent authority of the exporting country to provide certifications to India in compliance with requirements to allow for placing of meat and poultry in India market,” it  in the draft order. More than 20 countries, including members of the EU, South Korea and South Africa, have imposed curbs on poultry from certain US states or the entire country. China halted imports of US poultry and eggs after an avian flu strain was detected in the Pacific Northwest. The EU banned US chicken on account of chlorine treatment.',\n",
       " 'New study makes case that COOL didn’t hurt cattle imports By Bill Tomson POLITICO 1/22/15 6:32 PM EST Canadian and Mexican claims that the U.S. is importing less cattle from the two countries and U.S. companies are paying less money for the animals because of the USDA’s countryoforigin labeling rule just aren’t true, according to a new study being lauded by COOL proponents. The National Farmers Union, the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association and other COOL supporters  Thursday they hope U.S. trade officials will be able to use the study by Auburn University professor C. Robert Taylor in an appeal to the latest World Trade Organization decision against COOL. A WTO panel hearing on the appeal is scheduled for Feb. 1617, though a decision is not expected until fall. Pressure has been building in Congress and at USDA to tweak its rule for identifying where meat and poultry originates, as mandated by the 2008 Farm Bill, since a WTO panel found, on Nov. 28, in favor of Canadian and Mexican claims that the regulation created an unfair trade environment for their livestock industries. Intrinsic to the Canadian and Mexican claims are estimates that their ranchers are losing big money because COOL requires that foreign cattle be segregated at feedlots and packing houses in the U.S. Buyers then make up for those added costs by paying less for the foreign animals by as much as $90 per head. The latest estimate of damages being claimed by Canada is roughly $1.4 billion per , lawyers involved in the WTO case told POLITICO, but that number also includes damages the country is claiming from losses by Canadian swine exporters. Live hog exports from Canada have dropped by nearly 50 percent since COOL was first implemented in 2009, according to USDA data. Canada’s hog exports to the U.S. reached a record level of 9.3 million head in 2008, USDA data shows, but by 2013 Canada was shipping only 4.9 million. But when it comes to the $90perhead estimates for Canadian losses on cattle, that’s mostly based on research by University of California, Davis, agricultural economist Daniel Sumner. And it’s dead wrong, Taylor . Sumner’s numbers are based almost wholly on secretive data collected by the Canadian Cattlemen’s Association and is not publicly available, Taylor . The Auburn professor  his study, by contrast, is based on an examination of publicly available information collected from the USDA, including massive amounts of data from U.S. packers and feedlots on cattle purchases and prices. Taylor  his study was partially funded by the NFU but stressed that the group had no control over the results. While the Canadians and Mexicans argue that the price basis between their cattle and U.S. cattle has widened since COOL began — further pushing up discounts paid for foreign cattle — Taylor  the USDA data he sourced shows the average price basis actually narrowed. Taylor and others, like NFU President Roger Johnson, don’t deny that Canadian and Mexican cattle exports shrunk when COOL was implemented in 2008, but they stressed that U.S. consumers were eating less beef all around because of a sluggish economy. “COOL did not cause the declines in livestock exports to the United States, which largely coincided with a substantial global economic downturn that sapped demand for more expensive meat products,” Taylor . Johnson  the Taylor study could become very  if the U.S. loses its current WTO appeal and Canada and Mexico move to the next stage of the process, asking for the right to retaliate against the U.S. with tariffs on U.S. exports. In order to get damages, the plaintiffs have to show damages, he . “Today’s study casts significant doubt on the likelihood of any tariff penalties, since the COOL labels did not harm Canada or Mexico’s ability to export livestock to the United States,” Food & Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter  Thursday in a statement.',\n",
       " 'Senator preparing new push against currency cheats in trade By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON (Reuters) U.S. lawmakers are preparing a new push to stop trading partners unfairly manipulating their currencies to gain an export advantage, a senior Democrat  on Thursday. Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow  she was working with colleagues from both parties on a possible standalone bill to stop currency cheats and also aimed to ensure that an ambitious Pacific trade pact includes strict currency rules. \"We are talking about the right time to introduce a bill,\" Stabenow  in an interview with Reuters. \"Our message is that we should not agree to any trade agreement that does not have strong currency enforcement.\" The planned push is a further complication for U.S. officials already fighting opposition to fasttracking trade deals through Congress and worries about the TransPacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP deal covers 12 countries representing 40 percent of the world economy, including Japan, whose yen currency has weakened due to the country economic stimulus measures. Fresh demands from Congress would come at a delicate time for the TPP, which officials hope to wrap up within months after nearly five  of discussions. But U.S. auto makers fear increased competition from Japan, and the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Chrysler, Ford and General Motors all based in Michigan has  it will oppose a deal without strong currency rules. Democrat Sherrod Brown, who has introduced similar legislation in the past, is coordinating bipartisan work on a bill in the Senate and House lawmakers have also been consulted. Brown has championed U.S. steel producers such as Nucor Corporation and AK Steel Corporation in trade cases against China, which companies also accuse of currency manipulation. Republican Pat Tiberi, who chairs the trade subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways and Means,  the possibility of a separate bill was still under discussion but the issue had traction from both parties. More than half the lawmakers in the last Congress signed letters calling for tough TPP currency provisions, including 199 current House members and 50 current Senators. \"I think there bipartisan concern about currency manipulation,\" Tiberi , although one had to balance the risk that including such rules would upset TPP partners. A Mexican official familiar with the negotiations  it looked too late to include a currency measure in the pact. But another senior TPP country official  a currency clause might be acceptable if it mimicked existing international covenants, like International Monetary Fund rules committing countries to eschew currency manipulation for competitive advantage. \"If it is just going be a copypaste of something else it less serious,\" he . Stabenow  lawmakers were still working out how best to push the issue in Congress, including the option of amending planned fasttrack legislation, which allows Congress to set negotiating goals in exchange for a yesorno vote. \"The push regarding Japan is to make this one of the criteria in the trade agreement and the broader issue is that we would be doing something legislatively that would more broadly impact China and other countries,\" she .',\n",
       " \"U.K. Plans Plain Cigarette Packaging Starting in May 2016 By Eddie Buckle and Matthew Boyle WTO Reporter, January 23, 2015 Jan. 22 — Cigarettes and handrolling tobacco will have to be sold in standardized packs in England starting in May 2015, the U.K. government announced, bringing the country into line with practice in Australia. Parliament will be asked to pass the relevant legislation before May general election, Public Health Minister Jane Ellison  in a statement Jan. 21. The extension of tobacco plain packaging beyond Australia, where it was implemented in December 2012, threatens a $783 billion industry that already grappling with declining smoking rates and the introduction of ecigarettes. The legality of removing brand imagery is still in question, with challenges moving through the World Trade Organization. France, New Zealand and Ireland have  they want similar legislation, yet most countries have held off, awaiting the WTO ruling. The proposed rules in the U.K. specify mandatory colors for packaging—dull brown for the outside, white for the inside—and permit only specified text, such as the brand and type. The packs would continue to carry health warnings. “It an election  and plain packaging has taken on political football status,”  James Bushnell, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London. “Amid all the rhetoric, plain packaging implementation is yet to reach the acid test. Once the U.K. government passes legislation, it is likely the tobacco companies will sue.” Five countries, including Honduras and Indonesia, have opposed Australia plainpackaging rules, filing various disputes with WTO committees. The opponents argue that the law imposes restrictions on the use of trademarks, geographic indications and other markings in violation of international trade rules. Australian trade officials  at a Nov. 18 WTO meeting that those challenges “instill a form of regulatory chill, which is a wellknown tactic of the tobacco industry to avoid countries implementing tobacco control measures.” ‘Justified Response.’ The WTO decision isn't expected until the second half of 2016, yet Britain is plowing ahead. “The policy is a proportionate and justified response to the considerable publichealth harm from smoking tobacco,” Ellison, the U.K. minister,  in the statement. “Almost 80,000 people in England alone die every  from ill health caused by smoking. It places an enormous strain” on the statefunded National Health Service. Pediatrician Cyril Chantler, who conducted a review of standardized packaging for the U.K. government,  last  it was likely it would lead to “a modest, but  reduction” in the uptake and prevalence of smoking in Britain. The smoking rate in the U.K. has fallen below 20 percent, the lowest in 80 , scientists at University College London  last . Across Europe, a third of people smoke. Mixed Results The British government has responsibility for health care only in England, the largest of the four nations making up the U.K., so ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be asked to give consent to applying the same regulations. Litigation may delay implementation, Exane Bushnell . Since Australia introduced uniform cigarette packaging in 2012, results have been mixed. The 2013 Australia National Drug Strategy Household Survey found that daily smoking among people aged 14 and older declined from 15.1 percent in 2010 to 12.8 percent. Yet 3.4 percent of people aged 12 to 17  they smoked daily in 2013, up from 2.5 percent in 2010. A study by the Universities of Zurich and Saarland, funded by Philip Morris International Inc. and released last , found no evidence that plain packaging affected youth smoking prevalence. The academics surveyed 41,438 youths aged 14 to 17 between January 2001 and December 2013. Tobacco companies also say plain packaging leads to an increase in illicit smokes. “The data from Australia do not support plain packaging as a way to reduce smoking prevalence,”  Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg, adding that the policy will be challenged in the European Union. His comments were echoed by Imperial Tobacco Evans. “More than two  into the failed plain packaging experiment in Australia there simply no reason to think it will work,” Evans . According to a BAT statement, the move is a “serious error of judgment” given that evidence from Australia shows plain\\u2002packaging hasn't achieved its public health objectives and has led to an increase in illicit trade. Japan Tobacco Inc., the maker of Camel and Silk Cut in the U.K.,  it considers plain packaging would be unlawful. “It would deprive us of assets worth billions of pounds at a time when the U.K. economy appears to be turning the corner,” spokesman Jeremy Blackburn  by email.

       " 'U.S. Pushing For TPP Deal At March Ministerial; Timeline Aligns With TPA Inside U.S. Trade 01/23/2015 Posted: January 22, 2015 The United States is pushing to conclude the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) talks at a ministerial meeting slated to take place in midMarch, and sees next week informal negotiating round in New York City as a chance to resolve all but the most politically sensitive issues that will be taken up by ministers, according to informed sources. One source  the majority of TPP countries appear to be on board with that timeline. But some sources expressed doubt that the Jan. 26Feb. 1 informal round in New York will really be the last meeting involving only technicallevel negotiators, noting that this goal has been set for previous rounds and not been met. The TPP ministerial had been previously planned for Feb. 28March 1 but was subsequently pushed back to midMarch. The timing now roughly aligns with the Obama administration expectations for congressional consideration of a bill to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), as U.S. officials are indicating they expect movement on TPA legislation in Congress in March, sources . The administration seems to be banking on the idea that even if a TPA bill is not passed before the ministerial, the fact that there would be momentum in Congress toward passage would be sufficient to convince TPP ministers to conclude the negotiations, according to one informed source. In a related development, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (RUT) this week  he aims to introduce a TPA bill by the end of January and have the committee mark it up by the end of February (see related story). He did so in remarks to reporters after participating in a Finance Committee hearing on the economy. Sen. Charles Grassley (RIA)  after leaving the hearing that a TPA bill could come to the Senate floor in March, but stressed that this is an ambitious timeline because the Senate will be focused on budget issues during that month. The midMarch target for wrapping up the TPP talks was already suggested by U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in conversations with senators, according to Sen. John Cornyn (RTX) (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan. 16). The informal round taking place next week will involve chief negotiators as well as working groups on stateowned enterprises, intellectual property, rules of origin, financial services, legal issues and investment (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan. 9). Negotiators are also likely to meet bilaterally on market access issues, sources . The round is taking place at the Sheraton Times Square hotel. By some accounts, 15 of the 29 TPP chapters have been closed, according to informed sources. The round comes on the heels of intense bilateral engagement between the United States and several other TPP countries to try to make progress on outstanding issues. For instance, a U.S. negotiating team led by chief TPP negotiator Barbara Weisel traveled to Vietnam earlier this month to discuss outstanding issues, including labor, stateowned enterprises, market access and other issues, according to a USTR spokesman. U.S. teams also traveled to other TPP countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Peru, Chile and Mexico, the spokesman . In addition, Froman met with trade ministers from Peru, Chile and Mexico this month to discuss TPP. Industry sources  they now expect Froman to travel to Vietnam in early February to hold talks on outstanding TPP issues, including textiles and apparel. Matthew Schewel',\n",

       " 'Saudi King Abdullah dies, new ruler is Salman By Angus McDowall RIYADH, Jan 23 (Reuters) Saudi Arabia King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world top oil exporter and birthplace of Islam  in an official statement. King Salman has named his halfbrother Muqrin as his crown prince and heir, rapidly moving to forestall any fears of a succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders. The rise of Islamic State in wartorn Syria and Iraq has brought to the kingdom frontiers a militant group that vows to bring down the Al Saud dynasty. In Yemen, the Iranallied Shi\\'ite Houthis have all but seized power and plunged the country to the brink of total chaos, opening space for al Qaeda, which waged an insurgency in Saudi Arabia from 200306 and nearly killed a top prince in 2009. The problems in all those countries are being played out against an overarching backdrop of bitter rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and its arch regional foe Shi\\'ite Iran and bumps in Riyadh key relationship with the United States. Meanwhile the oil price has more than halved since June, leaving the kingdom likely to face its first budget deficit since 2009 and navigating difficulties with other OPEC members that disagree with its strategy not to defend prices. \"His Highness Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and all members of the family and the nation mourn the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who passed away at exactly 1 a.m. this morning,\"  the statement carried by state television. Abdullah,  by the Saudi embassy in Washington to have been born in 1924, had ruled Saudi Arabia as king since 2005, but had run the country as de facto regent for a decade before that after his predecessor King Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke. President Barack Obama expressed condolences and saluted the late king commitment to close U.S.Saudi ties. \"As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions,\" Obama  in a statement. \"One of those convictions was his steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the U.S.Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond.\" President George H. W. Bush who sent an American army to Saudi Arabia to help repel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 199091, described Abdullah as \"a wise and reliable ally, helping our nations build on a strategic relationship\" in a statement. In contrast, radical Sunni Islamist militants who want the kingdom destruction rejoiced on Twitter and on hardline online forums, with some praying that God make the death of a man they see as a \"tyrant\" the beginning of the end for Saudi Arabia. Abdullah pushed cautious changes in the conservative Islamic kingdom including increased women rights and economic deregulation, but made no moves towards democracy. At stake with the appointment of Salman as king is the future direction of the United States\\' most  Arab ally and selfappointed champion of Sunni Islam, which has played a pivotal role in the messy aftermath of the Arab spring. Abdullah played a guiding role in Saudi Arabia support for Egypt government after the military intervened in 2012, and drove his country support for Syria rebellion against President Bashar alAssad. LONG TERM CHALLENGES King Salman, thought to be 79, has been part of the ruling clique of princes for decades and is thought likely to continue the main thrusts of Saudi strategic policy, including maintaining the alliance with the United States and working towards energy market stability. During his five decades as Riyadh governor he was reputedly adept at managing the delicate balance of clerical, tribal and princely interests that determine Saudi policy, while maintaining good relations with the West. \"I think he will continue with Abdullah reforms. He realises the importance of this. He not conservative in person, but he values the opinion of the conservative constituency of the country,\"  Jamal Khashoggi, head of a news channel owned by a Saudi prince. \"King Abdullah was willing to challenge the conservatives, but not to crush them. Salman respected the status quo. He wanted reform but was very much connected to the tribal mentality, the conservative nature of his constituency,\" he added. Crown Prince Muqrin was placed firmly in the line of succession by Abdullah a  ago after serving as the kingdom intelligence chief and later an adviser to the king on foreign and security policy. He promised to continue Abdullah reforms, but has also demonstrated a populist edge by demanding banks serve the interests of Saudi citizens more fairly. In the long term Saudi rulers have to manage the needs of a rapidly growing population plagued by structural unemployment, and an economy that remains overly dependent on oil revenue and undermined by lavish subsidies. Saudi Arabia, which holds more than a fifth of the world crude oil, also exerts some influence over the world 1.6 billion Muslims through its guardianship of Mecca and Medina, Islam holiest sites. Incoming kings have traditionally chosen to appoint new ministers to head top ministries like oil and finance. In a country where the big ministries are dominated by royals, successive kings have kept the oil portfolio reserved for commoners and insisted on maintaining substantial spare output capacity to help reduce market volatility.',\n",

He later became trade secretary but his government career crashed in January 1986 when he was forced to resign amid intense public and political pressure after he became embroiled in the Westland helicopter affair that rocked the Conservative government. But he hit the front pages once more last . In July, lawmaker Simon Danczuk queried what Brittan had done with a dossier implicating public figures in child abuse that had been given to him in the early 1980s. The following day, Brittan issued a statement saying he had dealt with them correctly by passing them on to police and officials for examination. However the current top civil servant at the home office has revealed that 114 files handed to officials had gone missing, fuelling allegations of a highlevel coverup. A subsequent review concluded last November that there was nothing to substantiate these claims although the missing dossier could not been found. The current home secretary, Theresa May, has ordered a wideranging inquiry into child abuse, but it has been dogged by problems, with two chairmen being forced to resign before it has even got under way, her second choice quitting because of her links to Brittan',\n",

Atlanta, Jan. 22, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) The following is an article written by David Abney of UPS: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once wrote that poverty is \"the greatest of evils and the worst of crimes.\" While Shaw penned those poignant words more than a century ago, the reality is that too many people still lead lives filled with hunger and hardship. Most unjust is the number of children who grow up in poverty. According to UNICEF, more than 160 million malnourished children under the age of five suffer from stunted growth, and 22,000 children die each day from starvation or other health issues caused by poverty. Most die quietly, never able to fight for themselves. The good news is that gains have been made in reducing poverty. Between 1990 and 2010 a period when communism fell and markets opened the percentage of people living in extreme poverty in developing economies dropped by half, to 21 percent. Still, that still leaves more than 1 billion people surviving on $1.25 or less a day. As Nelson Mandela once , poverty is not an act of nature it a manmade problem that can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of us all. The World Bank has set an ambitious goal of bringing the last billion people out of extreme poverty by 2030, and it an endeavor we all should support. It truly will \"take a village,\" because the World Bank can\\'t end poverty solely through its development work. The question then is what more can be done and, not surprisingly, there are reasonable differences on the other tactics we should employ. For instance, some call for forgiving the debts of poor countries, while others advocate for microfinancing programs that provide loans at the grass roots. There another solution that has gotten little attention, yet is sitting right before us: enacting trade reforms that make it easier for every artisan, every entrepreneur, and every peasant farmer to sell their goods freely in other markets. An Undeniable Impact At UPS, we\\'ve always believed in the enabling power of trade, and I\\'m heartened this sentiment is gaining currency in development circles. For instance, the World Bank noted in a 2009 report that \"sustained longterm poverty reduction depends on stimulating economic growth, which in turn depends on trade policy reform.\" History shows that nations that open their economies to trade become more prosperous over time. Liberalizing trade creates the supply and demand that prompts businesses to hire more employees, which in turn enables these workers to feed their families. Opening economies also forces businesses to become more competitive. The ones that rise to the challenge are often able to then export their goods and services to other countries as well. But first we must enact the trade initiatives that are currently on the table. These include the Trade in Services Agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), and the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). Collectively, these initiatives would further reduce tariff and nontariff barriers, would liberalize services and public procurement, and promote greater cooperation among regulators. And they would bring jobs and hope to regions where these are in short supply. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the Trade Facilitation Agreement alone would create 21 million new jobs, with 18 million of those coming in the developing economies. Too Powerful to Ignore Of course, these initiatives have encountered their share of political resistance. This resistance was to be expected, because trade pacts have always inflamed passions. Nearly 200  ago, British historian Thomas B. Macaulay observed that \"free trade one of the greatest blessings which government can confer on its people is in almost every country unpopular.\" But recent history has shown how trade can lift developing economies and their people. We only have to contrast the China of today prosperous and globally engaged with its preliberalization days to see the benefits of opening markets that were long walled off. History has also shown the need to help economies make the transition to an open market. For instance, while the benefits of trade are undeniable, there a reasonable argument for providing assistance to displaced workers who need time to learn new skills. These issues aside, all of us have a moral obligation not to waver in our support because the benefits of trade economic and humanitarian are too powerful to ignore. But it will take an ongoing commitment by nations and their people, along with the efforts of public and private sectors, to end the injustices that poverty bestows on the least advantaged. David Abney is chief executive officer of UPS. END ________________________________',\n",

On Thursday 22 January, it called for the introduction of a European framework for ensuring the resumption of exports of certain products, according to a statement by Enrico Brivio, the spokesperson for the Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis The Commission does not want any bilateral agreements but rather, a European framework that is applied in the same way by Russia for all EU member states, explained the spokesperson (see EUROPE 11234). France has adopted an agreement of principle, which is expected to allow for the resumption of exports of live pigs from France to Russia, over the next few weeks (see EUROPE 11233). The Commission repeated that it had recently had technical discussions in Berlin between the Commission services and the Russian veterinary services to discuss sanitary and phytosanitary subjects involving pork meat products and potatoes (products subject to the Russian embargo). Enrico Brivio explained, however, that there was not as yet any formal agreement. The Commission had believed that it had detected a certain opening up from the Russians but the Commission has insisted on the need to have European certificates. Brivio indicated that the Commission is waiting for a response from the Russians and is hoping that the sanitary and phytosanitary barriers will be able to be lifted on these products. Russia has also requested that certain highvalue products are added to the list of products that can be exported. In February 2014, Russia imposed an embargo on European pork products (the EU filed a complaint at the  WTO). Since August 2014, Russia has imposed a ban on many different European food products (meat, fruit and vegetables, milk). (LC) Agence Europe SA',\n",

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. Business executives are rallying support in Davos for a controversial transatlantic trade deal, after being caught on the hop by popular and political protests against a possible agreement. Leading business figures admit they were slow to make the case for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which  Michael Froman, the US trade representative,  on Friday was strategically, political and economically . In an interview with the  Financial Times at the  World Economic Forum,  Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL, the German logistics group,  that business leaders were open to criticism \"for not explaining why this is very beneficial for Europe and the US\". Ahead of this week conference,  John Cridland, directorgeneral of the CBI, the British business organisation,  TTIP was his priority for the summit. \"We\\'ve got to get back on the front foot with the business community on TTIP,\" he told the FT. Unions and lobby groups have caught freetrade advocates by surprise with the strength of their protests against the TTIP investor protection clauses, which they say give too much power to big business to sue national governments. Mr Appel  on Friday that \"the claim [TTIP] undermines European laws is a completely factfree statement, but it popular\". Even if the problems can be ironed out, a TTIP deal is unlikely before 2016. But on the back of  Barack Obama State of the Union speech earlier this week, in which the US president stressed the  of free trade, Mr Froman is meeting a series of counterparts in Davos to thrash out a joint strategy to break through the logjam. He was due to speak on a panel with Mr Appel and Roberto Azevdo, the  World Trade Organisation directorgeneral, later on Friday, with the theme \"Rebooting global trade\". In a briefing, Mr Froman argued a TTIP deal was  because it would support small companies on both side of the Atlantic, boosting growth. It would also display Europe and America shared liberal values \"when there are a lot of [alternative] models out there\". The TTIP would also provide a bulwark to Europe in the face of Russia resurgence. \"At a time when there is geographical instability a [transatlantic trade deal] could help,\" he argued. This last view is also shared by  Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, where public opposition to TTIP is very vocal. She sees it as a strong anchor for the transatlantic alliance in a time of uncertainty and has made clear while at Davos that it will also be one of her priorities for 2015. Despite President Obama enthusiasm for free trade, such deals do not have the support of all Democrats. Democrat senators attending the Davos forum have pointed out that only Republicans applauded the trade passages of the State of the Union address. They  it would need a \"change in the weather\" to get trade through the Democrats, though with the Republicans in charge of both houses of Congress, not many would have to back such deals for the administration to gain approval.

       " 'FROMAN TAKES ON CRITICS CHARGING FAST TRACK RUSHES CONGRESS ON TRADE DEALS 23 January 2015I nside U.S. Trade U.S. Trade Representative  Michael Froman on Jan. 21 took on critics of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), or fasttrack legislation, who have charged that it serves to limit public scrutiny of future trade agreements, congressional debate of such deals and the ability to amend them. Fasttrack bills lay out a general blueprint for future trade agreements as negotiating objectives, but also the exact timeline for congressional consideration of a completed deal. \"Under previous TPA bills, the president was required to provide three months\\' 90 days\\' notice before signing an agreement,\" Froman told a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. \"Even when Congress begins its work, the process is designed to take up 90 legislative days, those are legislative days, different than calendar days.\" Froman  that 90 legislative days typically amount to five calendar months or more. \"So five calendar months, and three months advance notice this is hardly \"rushing to ram something through in the dead of night,\" he . \"The one thing about socalled \\'fast track\\' is that there is nothing fast about it.\" But Froman defense of fast track seemed limited to the argument that it allows ample time for public and congressional scrutiny. He did not address the key objection raised last  by 151 House Democrats that Congress has little say in whether agreements are eligible for fasttrack procedures since the administration determines whether it has met the conditions that make a trade agreement eligible for fast track (Inside U.S. Trade, Nov. 15, 2013). Under previous versions of TPA, as well as under the bill introduced last January by the chairmen of the congressional trade committees, a trade agreement is fasttrack eligible if it makes \"progress\" toward achieving the stated negotiating objectives and the administration has satisfied the conditions for congressional consultation, oversight and reporting requirements. Froman message comes the same week as key fasttrack critic Rep. Rosa DeLauro (DCT) charged publicly on Jan. 20 that TPA is \"designed to limit public scrutiny, to limit Congress ability to debate and amend the negotiated text, and it gives up congressional constitutional authority to carefully review the [Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)] and make changes if necessary to protect American workers and consumers.\" TPP is likely to be the first trade agreement that will be considered under a new fasttrack bill since it is further along than the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The \"contours\" of a TPP agreement are coming into focus, Froman told the conference of mayors. He also made the general point that the administration trade policy is a key part of its effort to \"restore\" America as a nation that manufactures products. He highlighted President Obama comments during his Jan. 20 State of the Union address that he is looking to Congress to pass a TPA bill. Similar to Obama, Froman  TPP is an alternative to a trade and investment model advocated by China that he charged is not consistent with American values. \"We can set clear, consistent rules about how to sell goods in markets abroad or we can allow corrupt bureaucrats in foreign capitals to continue picking winners and losers,\" Froman . He made three points that expressly contrasted TPP with the terms of the \"network of agreements\" that China is seeking to create in the Asia Pacific. The first is that TPP will include the \"highest and most enforceable\" labor and environmental standards in any trade agreement, while China alternative has none. He also  that TPP for the first time will put disciplines on stateowned enterprises and ensure a free and open Internet, while China alternative would not. This language echoes a White House fact sheet released alongside Obama speech, which  the president would work with Congress to promote U.S. jobs and workers \"by signing new trade deals so the United States, not China, sets the fair wage, safe workplace, and clean environment rules of trade.\" Froman did not expressly say that senior officials in Obama economic team, led by National Economic Council Director Jeff Zients, have been working to secure more votes for a TPA bill (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan. 16). He did that the administration is \"working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, underscoring what at stake, as the president did last night,\" and that this effort would continue to ensure the administration has the necessary support. Froman also  the TPP provisions on labor and environmental obligations are making good on Obama promises in the first presidential campaign to renegotiate the  North American Free Trade Agreement. \"What that meant was take labor and environment from being side issues not fully enforceable and making sure that they are treated just as seriously,\" he . \"And that exactly what we\\'re doing in TPP.\" Inside Washington Publishers',\n",
       " 'FINANCE, WAYS & MEANS SET JAN. 27 HEARINGS ON TRADE AGENDA WITH FROMAN 23 January 2015 Inside U.S. Trade. U.S. Trade Representative  Michael Froman will testify before the Senate Finance and House Ways & Means committees in separate Jan. 27 hearings on the administration trade policy agenda, both panels announced this week. The timing of the hearings is unusual, as the Ways & Means and Finance committees typically hold their annual hearings with USTR on the trade policy agenda in the spring after the agency delivers a written version of the president trade agenda. For instance, last  Ways & Means held its hearing with Froman on the trade policy agenda on April 3. Under Section 163 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, USTR is required to submit to Congress by March 1 of each  a report that includes \"the national trade policy agenda for the  in which the report is submitted.\" A spokesman for Ways & Means Chairman  Paul Ryan (RWI)  on Jan. 20 that the committee scheduled an early hearing because \"there is a lot moving quickly on the trade issue and we want to get started right away.\" He also  it is \"very possible\" that Ways & Means would hold additional trade hearings in the months to follow. The announcements come as Republicans on Ways & Means and Finance are pressing for quick action on a bill to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), and for President Obama to build support for the legislation among congressional Democrats. They are doing so even though TPA legislation has not yet been introduced in this Congress. Staff for Ryan, Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (RUT), and Finance Ranking Member Ron Wyden (DOR) have been holding discussions on potential changes to the TPA bill introduced in the last Congress by Hatch, former Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp and former Finance Chairman Max Baucus. Hatch referred to these discussions in a Jan. 20 speech to the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"I\\'m currently working with Ranking Member Wyden and Chairman Ryan to see if there are improvements that might be made to TPA so that we can introduce a bipartisan, bicameral bill in this Congress that we can move in short order,\" he . Hatch also  he plans to move \"carefully but quickly to introduce and mark up a TPA bill\" in the Finance Committee. But the Ryan spokesman  he does not expect a bill from those conversations to be introduced before the two hearings next week. Sources have  congressional Republicans hope to release a new TPA bill in early February. The Finance hearing is titled \"President Obama 2015 Trade Policy Agenda\" and will be held at 10 a.m. in Room 215 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, an advisory . The Ways & Means hearing, which is titled \"U.S. Trade Policy Agenda,\" will be held at 2 p.m. in Room HVC 210 of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. In addition to TPA and ongoing trade negotiations, other issues that could come up are the lapsed Generalized System of Preferences, which expired in 2013, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which will expire on Sept. 30 if Congress does not renew it. Froman will be the only witness at the hearings, though any individual or organization may submit a written statement for consideration by the committee and for inclusion in the printed record, according to the committee announcements.

       " 'EDITORIAL: Give Obama authority on trade deals The Wisconsin State Journal Tribune Content Agency, LLC 23 January 2015 The Wisconsin State Journal (Tribune Content Agency) Jan. 23You don\\'t often hear U.S. Rep.  Paul Ryan say he \"agrees with every word\" of something the president says. So let highlight and encourage this moment. It a big opportunity for Wisconsin economy and jobs. Ryan, RJanesville, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means,  this week he backs President  Barack Obama views on trade, as outlined in the president State of the Union address. \"I agree with every word he  in the speech with respect to trade and Asia and getting in there and helping write the rules instead of China writing the rules,\" Ryan told  MSNBC \"Morning Joe.\" \"The president is in the middle of negotiating a trade agreement with Asian nations, representing 40 percent of global GDP. This means more jobs for America. This means more exports for us. This is something we have to get on top of, and I agree with him on that.\" That good to hear, because Congress needs to approve trade promotion authority for the president, giving the administration a stronger hand when negotiating with global partners. During his speech Tuesday night, Obama stressed that more American exports will increase jobs and pay here. The Obama administration is pursuing a TransPacific Partnership with Japan and other nations. The president also hopes to seal a deal with the  European Union. Freetrade zones across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans would lower tariffs and smooth commerce for all while encouraging higher environmental and labor standards. Past trade agreements \"haven\\'t always lived up to the hype,\" Obama acknowledged. But \"95 percent of the world customers live outside our borders. We can\\'t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\" No, we can\\'t especially in a top manufacturing and dairy state such as Wisconsin, where research and technology are strong. Half of manufacturing executives say they\\'re actively looking to bring jobs back from China, Obama , \"So let give them one more reason to get it done.\" America needs one person not 535 members of Congress negotiating trade deals. That way, other nations know a deal is a deal after carefully balancing demands with concessions. Congress would still get the final say. By granting trade promotion authority to the president, Congress merely agrees to vote for or against a trade package without amendments. Some progressive Democrats and tea party Republicans have objected to the speed and secrecy of trade promotion power. But as  Michael Froman, the president trade representative, pointed out this week, the TransPacific Partnership has been \"under negotiation for five , during which we\\'ve had more than 1,600 briefings in Congress.\" The White House must notify Congress 90 days before an agreement is concluding and give lawmakers 90 legislative days to debate and vote on a bill. We trust Obama to negotiate trade deals that respect American workers and the environment. Wisconsin Democratic lawmakers should, too. At the same time, Ryan has to convince more of his peers not to reflexively vote against giving Obama more authority. The U.S. is running a trade surplus in manufacturing, agriculture and services with the 20 countries it has bilateral agreements with. Wisconsin should welcome more deals like that.',\n",
       " 'EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT LAYS OUT TISA DEMANDS, INCLUDING CHINA PARTICIPATION 23 January 2015 Inside U.S. Trade The  European Parliament rapporteur on the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) has laid out 10 demands that must be met for a final agreement to be acceptable to its members, including having China participate in the negotiations now taking place among selected members of the  World Trade Organization. \"China will certainly become one of the main trading partners in services,\"  Viviane Reding, the parliament TISA rapporteur and a member of the European People Party in a Jan. 13 press conference. \"It will be very  to have China on board and I think there is a general agreement in Europe that China should be granted access if it so wants to the negotiation table.\" She  that as negotiations advance, other emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa will join. The  European Commission formally backed China membership in March 2014, but has met with pushback from the United States. The U.S. opposes including China in TISA with the argument that China has not shown a lot of flexibility in the ongoing negotiations to expand the Information Technology Agreement and has failed to implement the adverse  WTO decision on electronic payments. The U.S. opposition is backed only by Japan, and to a lesser extent Canada (Inside U.S. Trade, May 16, 2014). In addition to laying out her conditions, Reding also emphasized that the parliament will take a more active interest in the negotiations, after not having been closely involved so far.\" You will hear a lot on this subject [of TISA] in 2015 [from the Parliament],\" she . She dismissed as \"completely wrong\" claims that TISA could be concluded this  and  2015 will be a working  to push the negotiations ahead \"with the contribution on the parliament.\" Parliament will hold a public hearing on TISA on Feb. 24, but Reding did not provide further details. That will be less than two weeks after the first TISA round of 2015, hosted by the U.S. Mission in Geneva from Feb. 913. Parliament will also this  present a report detailing its position on TISA after further consulting with the public and private sectors, NGOs, social partners and national parliaments, according to Reding. She gave no timeline for the release of the report. Reding split her conditions into two groups: five that must be included in the TISA and five that must be excluded from a final deal which she designated as red lines. In the second group, Reding highlighted the need to keep strong protections for personal data, and  she was \"rather nervous when I see what going on so far in the TISA negotiation\" in light of an April 2014 U.S. proposal on the free flow of data leaked late last . \"We will not accept that through the back door our established rules on data protection could be wiped out,\" she . \"So we will be extraordinarily cautious on this chapter and we expect from the  European Union that it acts on this in order to defend the basic rules\" of its privacy protection regime. In a Dec. 3 Committee on International Trade hearing, Reding attacked a U.S. proposal on ensuring the free flow of data as seeking to specifically create exemptions to privacy and data protection. The U.S. proposal would seek to establish broad rights for private service suppliers to transfer information including personal data into and out of a party territory, as long as it is in connection with the conduct of the firm business (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 19, 2014). The language being advocated by the U.S. does not contain an explicit exception for data privacy measures or other reservations, in contrast to the other provisions in the proposal aimed at removing localization requirements. The data transfer provision is contained in \"Article X.4: Movement of Information\" of the leaked text, and appears to be a proposal for TISA ecommerce annex. It would apply across all sectors covered by the agreement. Her demands for TISA exclusions also cited health, education, and water services. \"They are not for sale,\" she . She also  there can be no chapter on the movement of natural persons, as the issue of immigration must be left to member states. There would be a \"tsunami of public opinion if the EU were to remove its rules\" on immigration, according to Reding. The temporary movement of natural persons known as the Mode 4 of services supply is being raised in the TISA negotiations by the  European Commission, which in June 2014 tabled a proposal that would delineate three categories of professionals covered by such commitments Among the items that Reding  must be included, she cited high international standards for doing business in such areas as telecommunications, air and maritime transport sectors. These should reflect the EU existing standards in those areas, she . The agreement must result in foreign services markets becoming as open as the EU market, Reding . Nontariff barriers drive up the cost of doing business for EU companies an additional 15 percent in Canada and go up to as high as 68 percent additional cost in China, she . An acceptable TISA deal would have to bring those costs closer to the 6 percent additional cost that foreign companies are faced with when operating in the EU, according to Reding. The parliament also expects to see tangible benefits for EU citizens in the areas of online shopping, consumer protection in online banking, and when traveling abroad, she . In addition, she  a statetostate dispute mechanism should be included in the  WTO framework to ensure that the agreement is enforced. Inside Washington Publishers',\n",

Follow her on  Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. ( CNN) During the 2004 presidential election, I spent time near Canton, Ohio, trying to turn out votes for John Kerry. I visited neighborhoods around the struggling Rust Belt town, knocking on doors and repeating a campaignprepared script about Senator Kerry plans to put the middle class back on track. The voters scoffed at me, surveying their decaying porches with the decaying economy all around them. They blamed trade deals, especially the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for the loss of good manufacturing jobs in the area, and laws giving steel and auto plants the chance to move jobs overseas. One after another, each voter reminded me that both parties supported the crappy NAFTA deal that got us into this mess. How could we trust any of them to get us out? A decade later, just after the 20th anniversary of NAFTA, President  Obama is marking the disastrous legacy of free trade policies by working with Republicans to push for even more bad trade deals that would benefit big businesses at the expense of America economy and workers. President  Obama has outlined an ambitious agenda to help the middle class. But his eagerness to find some area of compromise with Republicans in the form of trade policy risks undermining all his other plans. \"I\\'m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\\'t just free, but fair,\" President  Obama  in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night as Republicans stood and applauded while Democrats rightly stayed in their seats. Trade promotion authority is a new synonym for \"fasttrack authority\" which would give the president authority to negotiate international trade agreements on his own. Congress could veto such deals, but could not amend or filibuster them. Fasttrack trade authority removes  checks and balances not only in our legislative process but in our economy as a whole. This is a bad idea for two reasons. In recent history, trade deals enacted by Washington have been bad for American workers and our economy. President  Obama and Republicans promote trade deals as good for economic growth and job creation. \"Ninetyfive percent of the world customers live outside our borders, and we can\\'t close ourselves off from those opportunities,\" President  Obama . However, government data analyzed by the nonprofit  Public Citizen shows that under two decades of fasttrack trade agreements, U.S. trade deficits have gotten worse increasing by over 440%. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs in America have been lost since fasttrack deals like NAFTA and related agreements. While President  Obama has emphasized that he wants to reduce income inequality, numerous studies say such trade deals have contributed to the rise in income inequality. In fact, wages in the United States have remained mostly stagnant, adjusted for inflation, since the mid1970s when fasttrack trade authority was first enacted even though worker productivity has doubled in the same period. All of this suggests we need more scrutiny on these trade deals, not less. Given the evidence of the destruction of previous trade deals, we need giant caution signs, speed bumps and roadblocks not a fast track. The other problem with fasttrack trade authority is that it allows our trade negotiators to unilaterally undermine democratically passed legislation. For instance, the TransPacific Partnership, an 11nation deal championed by both President  Obama and top Republicans in Congress, is not really about trade. Of the partnership 29 chapters, only five address trade issues. The other chapters do things like create new monopoly patent extensions for pharmaceutical companies that would raise medicine prices for average Americans, and create a right for foreign firms to import food to the U.S. exempt from our current food safety standards. The TransPacific Partnership would even restrict certain \"buy local\" and \"buy American\" initiatives in other words, preventing American consumers from protesting the trade deal with their own votes and wallets. I should add that this is what watchdogs think is in the TransPacific Partnership deal because of document leaks. We don\\'t know for sure, because while 600 private corporations have been involved in negotiating the terms of the trade deal behind closed doors, even Congress won\\'t get to see the terms of the deal until after it signed. That why many Democrats oppose the deal, and similarly disastrous trade deals like it. If more crummy jobkilling trade bills are what comes from bipartisanship, I would rather take more bitter acrimony. Cable News Network LP.',\n",
       " 'Commentary: ChinaSwitzerland FTA sets example for ChinaEU cooperation liuyue 23 January 2015 Xinhua China Economic Information Service BEIJING, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between China and Switzerland has brought concrete benefits to both sides and set a good example for ChinaEU cooperation. When meeting with President of the Swiss Confederation Simonetta Sommaruga in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on Wednesday, Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  that both sides should further implement the FTA, expand twoway investment and deepen cooperation in highend manufacturing and modern agriculture so as to benefit the two countries. Switzerland has become China first free trade partner in the world 20 leading economies. Under the trade agreement, almost all Chinese exports to the European country are exempt from tariffs, while nearly 85 percent Swiss exports to China are dutyfree. There is no doubt that the ChinaSwiss FTA has yielded fruitful achievements. Under the FTA framework, Switzerland and its competitive industries, including medicine, machinery, watch making and tourism, benefited from the vast Chinese market. Meanwhile, China imported cuttingedge technology from Switzerland, which helped accelerate industrial transformation and upgrade, and Chinese consumers are enjoying more tarifffree Swiss products. According to statistics, bilateral trade rose steadily and the trade structure has been optimized. From January to November 2014, trade volume between the two countries reached 38.86 billion U.S. dollars. The FTA between China and Switzerland serves as a model for economic cooperation between China and Europe as a whole. China and the  European Union (EU), two world economic giants, have been involved in a series of trade disputes. However, Beijing is committed to resolving economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultations and expressed its willingness to start a joint feasibility study on a ChinaEU FTA. China, which is going through a structural economic slowdown, and the EU, which is struggling for recovery, need each other. An FTA between China and the EU, the largest trading partner of China, will definitely promote the economic development of both sides and help fuel the world economy. South Korea has signed an FTA with the EU and Japan is also itching to get involved. Thus, it is high time for China and the EU, which together account for nearly 33 percent of the global economy, to start FTA negotiations as soon as possible to give full play to their respective advantages.

       " 'OpEd Columnist : Opinion :Dont Blame Nafta By JOE NOCERA 24 January 2015 NYTimes.com Feed On Wednesday, the day after President Obamas State of the Union address, a handful of Democratic House members, along with one senator, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, held a news conference to denounce one of the very few proposals the president put forward that actually has a chance of passage. The objects of their displeasure were the new trade agreements currently being negotiated by the administration. Since Ive been in Congress, Ive never seen a trade bill that in any way benefited U.S. manufacturers and workers,  Representative Louise Slaughter, who has represented the Rochester area for 28 . She pointed to  Kodak as an example of a company harmed by trade accords, especially the landmark  North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Since the deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico went into effect in 1994,  Kodaks Rochester work force has shrunk to 2,300 from 39,300. We are fighting for the future of middleclass families,  Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. These trade deals make it much easier for corporations to send American jobs overseas. Over the past 20 , Connecticut has lost more than 96,000 manufacturing jobs, she , because of agreements that failed to protect American workers. Sanders told the assembled media that while he liked the presidents speech, he was wrong on one major issue, and that is the TransPacific Partnership. He added, I do not believe that continuing a set of bad policies, policies that have failed, makes any sense at all. The TransPacific Partnership is a trade agreement currently being negotiated between 12 countries, including Japan, Canada, Vietnam, Mexico, Australia and Peru; the countries involved in the negotiations represent nearly 40 percent of HYPERLINK \"javascript:void(0)\" global gross domestic product. It is as complex as it is ambitious. Yet, while the Republican leadership has vowed to work with President Obama on the TransPacific Partnership (as well as on another deal being negotiated with the  European Union), the Democrats have been vocal in their opposition. In the short term, they dont want to give the president socalled fasttrack authority, which would allow the administration to negotiate the deal and then hand Congress a finalized agreement that it could only vote up or down, with no amendments. (Fasttrack procedures have been used to conclude 14 trade agreements since 1974.) Youd need a heart of stone not to be sympathetic to the concerns of the Democrats. Over the last two decades, lots of manufacturing jobs have vanished in the United States, inflicting a great deal of pain on workers. During those same 20 , Nafta has been in force. Linking those job losses to the existence of Nafta is a leap the Democrats and progressives in general have made. The question that needs to be asked, however, is whether that link is justified. I am skeptical of definitive judgments on Nafta,   Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the  Council on Foreign Relations. We started offshoring television assembly in the 1960s decades before Nafta. Yes, many assembly plants have been built in Mexico since Nafta went into effect. But HYPERLINK \"javascript:void(0)\" China, where millions more manufacturing jobs have migrated and with which we have a huge trade deficit doesnt even have a trade agreement with the United States. Edward Gresser, the executive director of Progressive Economy, a leftleaning think tank, noted that other factors were taking place at the same time as Nafta: the growth of container ships, the lowering cost of communications, the rise of global industries. With or without trade deals, globalization is an unstoppable force. What Nafta really is, Gresser told me, is a proxy for globalization. One mistake the Nafta negotiators made more than two decades ago was taking worker rights and environmental protections out of the agreement itself and putting them into a side letter. They were never effectively enforced. Those negotiating the TransPacific Partnership expect to rectify that error this goround. They are also aiming to pry open the Japanese auto and agricultural markets to American producers, and include protections for a free and open Internet. It has, in other words, a lot more potential to do good than harm. When I spoke to Slaughter on Thursday afternoon, she was still riled up. These crazy trade agreements, she called them at one point. She added, Rochester really suffered. She told me about all the jobs lost at  Kodak. I think Nafta brought down  Kodak, she . But of course it didnt. HYPERLINK \"javascript:void(0)\" Kodaks problems came about because digital photography made film unnecessary and  Kodak didnt shift course in time. She was blaming Nafta for  Kodaks selfinflicted wounds. But then her tone brightened. She told me about all the new companies 55 in all, she  that had taken space in the old  Kodak buildings. Some were even run by former  Kodak engineers. Which, of course, is precisely the way globalization is supposed to work. The New York Times Company',\n",

The sources  Prime Minister\\' Additional Secretary Fawad Hasan Fawad, a very powerful bureaucrat in the present setup, was also one of the short listed candidates for this very attractive post but he did not appear before the interview committee headed by Commerce Minister Engineer Khurram Dastgir and comprising four Federal Secretaries.

       " 'Foreign firms in China: You\\'re still welcome 24 January 2015 The Economist The country leaders seek to reassure nervous foreign businesses THE bosses of foreign firms with operations in China grumble that their lives have got harder of late. China used to be a frontier market offering endless doubledigit growth. Officials put out the welcome mat, and were open to wining and dining. Regulators were no more bothersome than in other emerging markets. Now, growth is slowing: official data released this week confirm that the economy grew by 7.4% last , the slowest rate in 24 . A crackdown on official corruption has made it impossible to win friends in government. And antitrust authorities have taken a tough line with foreign carmakers, drugmakers and other firms that had hoped their guanxi (connections) offered them protection. Many foreign bosses are now convinced that the golden age for multinationals in China is over. That may explain the charm offensive the government launched this week. The prime minister,  Li Keqiang, led a delegation of Chinese worthies to the  World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. He promised the assembled global business elite his country would \"treat Chinese and foreign companies as equals\" and \"rigorously reject protectionism\". Ahead of his speech the government unveiled a dramatic proposal to ease its restrictions on foreign investment. Over the past two decades, China has maintained a highly restrictive, complex set of rules on how foreigners can invest on the mainland. In the many industries deemed \"strategic\", for example, they must invest only through a joint venture and must transfer technology to the local partner. Flows of funds in and out of the country are also tightly controlled. The draft reforms, which are now open for comment, include scrapping almost all of these cumbersome controls. Foreign firms would supposedly be treated the same way as national ones. The clunky system of casebycase approvals will be replaced by a simpler \"negative list\": if your industry is not on it, you do not need permission to invest. Daniel Roules of the Shanghai office of Squire Patton Boggs, an American law firm, believes the new lawif and when it comes into forcecould usher in a significant and welcome change in the climate for foreign firms. Mr Li is also pushing for bilateral investment treaties with the United States and the  European Union, which could further reassure foreign investors worried about putting more money into China. His boss,  Xi Jinping, agreed a sweeping freetrade agreement with Australia on the heels of the recent G20 summit in Brisbane. This provisional deal, which must now be ratified, goes much further than previous accords in opening up China service industries to foreign investment. Taken together, say optimists, there could yet be another golden age for foreign direct investment (FDI) into China. A recent report by King & Wood Mallesons, China biggest law firm, forecasts that FDI could reach $188 billion in 2020, up from about $120 billion last . Nevertheless, foreign businesspeople should not break out the champagne yet. The proposed reforms are a strong signal that foreign money will continue to be welcome in China. However, they may do nothing to help foreignowned firms compete on equal terms with politically wellconnected domestic ones, to end the subsidies lavished on statebacked enterprises, or to rein in regulators keen on bashing outsiders. The areas of business most tempting for foreigners, such as finance and the internet, will still have restrictions on foreign ownership. If China leaders were to take on all these distortions, then they would get a far warmer round of applause at their next Davos appearance. The Economist Newspaper Limited (The Economist)',\n",

       " \"Modi determined to make Obama visit a 'landmark event' for food security and nuclear deal MAIL TODAY BUREAU 25 January 2015 Most observers are expecting US President  Barack Obama’s New Delhi visit to achieve little and be merely of symbolic importance. In their view, all that will happen is that the two countries will take decisions to push ahead some of the outstanding issues in the agenda. However, sources in the Government say that that could be an inaccurate reading of the situation. The sources say that Prime Minister  Narendra Modi is determined to make the visit a landmark event. As for the Americans, they have been waiting for an India leader with whom they could do business. Modi showed this by getting the India bureaucracy to move swiftly, after his first meeting with Obama, to resolve the dispute over food security issues to pave the way for the trade facilitation agreement under the  WTO. The key breakthrough expected is in easing the deadlock arising from India’s nuclear liability act which has prevented foreign companies from investing or providing technology for civil nuclear trade with India. Insurance pool The draconian provisions relating to suppliers’ liability, well in excess of international norms, is likely to be taken care of by creating an insurance pool backed by the government of India. The sources say that there will be no change in the legislation, something which would have required the cooperation of the Opposition in the Upper House. Another area where we could see forward movement is in the defence relationship between the two countries. New Delhi and Washington will renew the Framework Agreement and could move swiftly in several of what are termed “foundational agreements” that would allow US forces to access India facilities and build interoperability with the India armed forces. WikiLeaks cables relating to the issue revealed a pattern of delaying tactics in relation to the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) and the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange for Geospatial Cooperation (BEGC). These have been laid at the door of former defence minister A.K. Antony who was dead against deepening cooperation with the US who was afraid that such agreements would imply that India had become an American ally. Having put the Congress era to an end, Modi also intends to give a final burial to its defence and foreign policies. These foundational agreements are a logical outgrowth from the decision of India and the US to establish a strategic partnership. While some elements of the partnership such as easing of military sales as well as joint exercises have progressed, India has not been able to push the US into higher levels of technology transfer and joint technology development. Of course, there is another outstanding problem here — India is not a member of the four key western technology denial cartels, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Missile Technology Control Regime. But once the two countries clinch an agreement in the nuclear liability issue, the way will be open for the US to push for India to be made a member of these cartels. Only when this happens will there be a qualitative movement in the Defence Trade and Technology Initiative where the Americans have identified 17 items for coproduction and codevelopment. Progress in this area has been slow, but the Obama visit has given the opportunity for the two sides to accelerate the process of moving ahead. Climate change As far as the economic relations are concerned, the two countries haven’t applied themselves with the kind of effort that has gone into untangling their strategic ties which were hit by the nuclear liability act. But the one area where Obama is pushing hard is that of a bilateral treaty on controlling emissions as a prelude to Paris Climate Change Conference later this . For Obama, getting a treaty is a legacy issue. The gap between US and India positions is wide, but perhaps the Modi magic may cover it. Muchtalked about visit to Taj Mahal cancelled US President  Barack Obama’s muchpublicised visit to the Taj Mahal has been cancelled. Just before he boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base with his wife Michelle for India, the White House  in a statement that the visit has been cut short as the US president will be flying to Saudi Arabia on January 27 instead of Agra. Obama was scheduled to visit Agra to see the Taj with Michelle on Tuesday. A White House statement on Saturday : “We adjusted the schedule in coordination with the India government so that the president would be able to depart India following his speech on Tuesday to stop in Riyadh during the return trip to meet King Salman (new Saudi ruler) and other officials and offer his condolences.” Obama, meanwhile, expressed regret for being unable to visit Agra. However, there were strong rumours that the US president’s programme was cancelled due to security reasons. Associated Newspapers\",\n",
       " 'Smoking stuck in the last chance saloon Matthew Goodman 25 January 2015 The Sunday Times The tobacco giants could see their brands wiped out with plain packaging. They will fight back hard, says Matthew Goodman How hard would it be to go for six months without trying a cigarette? Millions of German schoolchildren have faced that challenge, under the slogan \"Be Smart, Don\\'t Start\". Pupils aged 12 to 15 take part in an annual competition designed to discourage them from picking up the habit. It is one of several initiatives set up to educate youngsters about the dangers of cigarettes. According to  Imperial Tobacco, the FTSE 100 company behind brands including Lambert &Butler and Gauloises, schemes such as this offer a model for how the government should tackle the takeup of smoking by young people. The ideas have fallen on deaf ears. Last week, ministers announced a much blunter plan to stop tobacco companies in their tracks. Manufacturers will be forced to drop all branding from cigarette packs, thus denting the appeal, particularly to impressionable teens. The desert camel and the distinctive red Marlboro logo will disappear. Instead, smokes will come in plain boxes bearing only health warnings. Parliament will vote on the proposal before the general election in May and it could become law a  later. Other recent proposals include making it illegal to smoke in a car with children inside. Jane Ellison, the public health minister, described the longmooted packaging plan as \"a proportionate and justified response\" to the risks associated with smoking. The manufacturers reacted with fury. British American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strike, described it as a \"serious error of judgment\", while Marlboro maker  Philip Morris International  it was \"legally questionable\" and amounted to \"government censorship\". To date, just one other country has imposed restrictions on cigarette packaging. In 2012 Australia ordered manufacturers to use identical olivegreen boxes. The only way to spot one brand from another is to check the name typed on the box in small letters underneath an explicit health warning. There are also gruesome photographs. The law is the subject of a number of legal challenges. Several countries, including Indonesia, Cuba and Ukraine, have appealed for the  World Trade Organisation ( WTO) to take action against it. They argue that restricting the use of trademarks is a violation of international trade agreements. The  WTO is expected to give its ruling during the second half of next . Britain has decided that it cannot afford to wait. The policy has been on and off the agenda for several . It is now expected to garner enough support to become law, despite opposition from some Conservative MPs who argue that it and the other proposals smack of the nanny state. If the changes are voted through, there will inevitably be legal challenges here too. In a submission to the government,  Philip Morris  it was \"prepared to protect its rights in the courts and to seek fair compensation for the value of its property\". Imperial has not ruled out taking legal action against the government — Britain accounts for about a fifth of its sales. Analysts at the investment bank  Citigroup predicted that tobacco companies could potentially seek compensation running to \"hundreds of millions and possibly billions of pounds\". The manufacturers have also warned that the packaging ban would be an open invitation to cigarette smugglers. The illicit trade is  to account for about 10% of cigarette sales in Britain already, a figure likely to increase if standardised packs become the norm. Manufacturers point out that those peddling contraband will not worry whether the buyers are legally old enough to smoke. A report published last  by  KPMG, which was commissioned by  Philip Morris and the Australian arms of Imperial and  British American Tobacco,  that consumption of illegal cigarettes rose down under after the branding ban started. It concluded that black market products had grown from 13.5% to 14.3% of total consumption, depriving the Australian government of more than £630m in tax revenues. Tobacco companies and the government appear to be at odds over the impact of the Australian ban on smoking levels. The country health department stated that consumption \"fell by 3.4% in 2013, relative to 2012 when plain packaging was introduced\". In the first quarter of last , the most recent figures available, consumption was  to be the \"lowest ever recorded\". Some argue that this is the continuation of a trend already under way, reflecting life style changes and tax increases on tobacco products. The industry supporters point to other data to support their argument that plain packaging has had no effect, such as a survey that found 3.4% of Australians aged 12 to 17  they smoked daily in 2013, up from 2.5% in 2010. The big players in Britain insist there is no proof that plain packaging has had any useful impact. \"There no evidence that it will have any benefit to public health,\"  Imperial. So far, the markets have remained relatively sanguine about the likely impact on the two listed manufacturers. Imperial shares closed up 0.4% on Thursday, having earlier fallen just 1% when the market opened the morning after Ellison statement to parliament about the new measures. The share price of  British American Tobacco climbed 1.2% on Thursday. Partly, this was a reflection of the market already having factored in the prospect of tougher regulation on the industry. Mark Barnett, head of UK equities at  Invesco Perpetual, a leading shareholder in Imperial and British American, : \"[A ban on branded packs] has been on the fringes of the political landscape for a while so it not something we have not had a chance to think about.\" Analysts pointed out that the branding ban does not necessarily spell bad news for all. Martin Deboo, consumer goods specialist at the investment bank Jefferies,  that Imperial had won market share in Australia because plain packaging helped to fuel sales of cheaper brands such as its JPS. \"Imperial has demonstrated it can be a winner in a plain packaging environment,\" he . The question remains as to whether the company could repeat the trick in this country, where it has a much larger slug of the market than in Australia. There is also the worry that if legal action fails to overturn the ban in Australia, and Britain follows suit, other countries around the world will be encouraged to do likewise. Analysts at  Citigroup : \"We expect the policy to spread to many markets over the following five , just as graphic health warnings and smoking bans have.\" Countries such as Ireland, France and New Zealand have already stated that they favour the introduction of plain packs. The battle is only just beginning. News UK & Ireland Limited',\n",

       " 'Junk food, booze may follow tobacco in plainwrapper push Matthew Boyle 24 January 2015 Postmedia Breaking News Plain packaging laws for cigarettes have thrown the Marlboro Man off his horse in Australia and now the U.K. is set to follow. Junk food and alcohol could be next. The U.K. plan to force tobacco companies to sell their wares in standardized packs starting next  has revived concern among consumerproduct makers that other goods deemed unhealthy by health campaigners could face similar legislation. Alcohol in Indonesia, infant formula in South Africa, and fatty foods in Chile are among the items already being targeted. The food and drink industries may have to consider adopting new marketing strategies for wellknown international brands if the  World Trade Organization rules in Australia favour in cases challenging the country 2012 plain packaging law for cigarettes. Such a development would be far reaching for consumergoods makers, one industry group has . \"I think it highly likely that plain packaging extends into other categories, especially alcohol and junk food,\"  Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Germany  Berenberg Bank. \"By the time tobacco plain packaging is established, it will be too late for the others to push back as the precedent will be set.\" Food and beverage companies are aware of this. In 2012, closely held candy maker  Mars Inc. wrote to the U.K. Department of Health, saying the consequences of tobacco plain packaging would be \"dramatic\" as it would \"set a key precedent for the application of similar legislation to other industries.\" A spokeswoman for Mars, the maker of MMs and Snickers chocolates, declined to comment further. The U.K.based Consumer Packaging Manufacturers Alliance, which represents brand owners and packaging companies, has  plain packaging would have \"catastrophic effects,\" shifting investment and manufacturing jobs outside of Britain. Marques, a European body representing companies such as  Unilever and  AnheuserBusch InBev NV,  \"any plainpackaging requirements would be setting a precedent for other products.\" \"Tobacco was the focus of regulators and now there will be more attention on the next wave of products seen as less healthy,\" Richard Webster, a partner at management consultancy Bain Co.,  in an interview in London. \"Plain packaging would remove the incentive to innovate, if all the packages looked the same. It would be a race to the bottom.\" Companies also contend that plain packaging violates their intellectual property rights, which are laid out in an international treaty commonly known as Trips. While Article 20 of Trips says the use of trademarks \"shall not be unjustifiably encumbered,\" a separate part of the agreement, Article 8, says countries can amend laws to \"adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition.\" \"If you can come up with a justifiable reason for public health, that will give a government allowance to restrict intellectual property,\" says Sarah Wright, a partner specializing in intellectual property at law firm Olswang in London. \"Article 8 is an exception to Article 20.\" Governments are already acting upon that exception. Indonesia, Southeast Asia largest economy and home to the world biggest Muslim population, last  proposed legislation that would require alcohol manufacturers to either use plain packaging or place graphic warnings on labels to curtail consumption. Indonesia, a big exporter of cigarettes, is one of the five countries challenging Australia plain packaging of tobacco at the  WTO. A decision is expected next .  Diageo Plc, the world biggest distiller, has targeted Indonesia as a key growth market, and net sales there last  grew by more than 10 per cent, boosted by growing demand for Guinness stout. \"Alcohol and tobacco are very different products and warrant different approaches,\" Diageo spokeswoman  Cecilia Coonan  in an email. \"But plain packaging strips legitimate companies of their ability to brand and market their products. In the case of alcohol, there is no evidence that it would reduce harmful drinking.\" In December 2012, South Africa prohibited \"aggressive or inappropriate marketing of breast milk substitutes\" such as formula milk. The regulations allowed company and brand logos, as long as they did not contain a picture of an infant \"or other humanized figure.\" That would prohibit the logo of  Nestle SA Gerber brand, which depicts an infant with mouth agape. The world biggest food company does not sell infant formula in South Africa due to \"the recently revised codes that govern\" the industry, spokesperson Ravi Pillay  via email. Chile has proposed regulations that would place images of \"Stop\" signs on food high in fat, sugar and salt. Higher taxes, additional nutrition information and restrictions on the marketing and display of products are among other measures governments can impose short of plain packaging. The U.K. in 2007 banned the advertising of unhealthy foods during children television programs, and the U.S. has removed such ads from schools. Advocacy groups including the U.K. Alcohol Health Alliance have proposed minimum pricing for a unit of alcohol, not plain packaging. \"Plain packaging is a very extreme course there is a whole range of possible interventions legislators could take,\" Wright, the intellectual property lawyer, . \"It unlikely they would go there unless they have exhausted other options.\" Â© Copyright (c) The Regina LeaderPost Canwest News Service END ________________________________',\n",

SchneiderAmman . The Swiss official, who chaired the two days of talks held on the sidelines of the 2015 World Economic Forum,  ministers held \"good and open discussions\" This marks the first time since the talks dramatically collapsed in summer 2008 that a concerted political push has been given to jumpstart them. The talks, sponsored by the World Trade Organization, broke down mainly because of differences between the US and EU and emerging powers such as China and India. \"We were encouraged by the consensus on the need for a more honest and realistic discussion on the Doha talks in Geneva,\" Michael Punke, deputy U.S. Trade Representative, who attended the meeting along with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, told WWD. Cecilia Malstrom, EU trade commissioner, , \" it was a good meeting, but there still a lot to be done to try and define a road map to move” ahead. The objective is to come up with a blueprint by July on how to slash tariffs and other barriers to trade on industrial goods, agriculture and services. Tim Groser, New Zealand trade minister, , \"There is a high level of understanding we need to recalibrate\" the level of ambition, but noted it should not be meaningless because some negotiations on regional agreements are producing real substance. Groser  ministers also strongly backed WTO chief Roberto Azevedo’s attempts to intensify discussions. \"He can\\'t do it by himself, he needs major developed and developing countries to get behind him,\"  Groser. Azevedo, who attended the talks,  negotiators need to be \"creative and openminded.\" \"We decided we needed to change the conversation,\" Azevedo , adding the world economy is in need of good news. SchneiderAmman  what matters is \"to achieve results \" by the WTO trade ministerial conference to be held in Nairobi in December.',\n",
       " 'WTO ministers in Davos back efforts to conclude Doha Round negotiations 25 January 2015 Middle East North Africa Financial Network (MENAFN) (MENAFN Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) Ministers in charge of WTO affairs and WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo met on Saturday in Davos, at the invitation of Swiss minister of economic Johann SchneiderAmmann. \"The purpose of the informal gathering was to discuss the negotiating agenda for 2015 in view of a conclusion of the Doha Round,\"  SchneiderAmmman in a press conference. Some 21 WTO members, represented at the ministerial level, attended the meeting on the fringes of the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos. Ministers stressed the importance of achieving progress on the \"Doha Development Agenda,\" issues that had remained unsolved at the Bali Ministerial Conference in December 2013, notably in the areas of agriculture, industrial products and services, he added. SchneiderAmmann noted that ministers underlined their readiness to engage constructively towards a realistic and clearly defined \"work programme\" by July, framing the negotiations on the remaining Doha issues. \"In this context, they recalled the central development dimension of the Round and its particular focus on issues relevant for least developed countries.\" Furthermore, ministers welcomed the hosting by Kenya of the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in December 2015. \"Twenty  after the Organization establishment, the ministers shared an understanding that very  objectives are on the WTO agenda in 2015, and we expressed our confidence that Members will succeed in meeting these objectives in a timely way,\" he added. They also reiterated their commitment to implementing all decisions taken at the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, including on public stockholdings for food security purposes as amended in November 2014. A sense of urgency must be instilled to the work in Geneva. Intensive efforts will be required in the three main areas of negotiations agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services but also in other fields. Furthermore, the development dimension, and in particular aspects relevant to least developed countries, will have to remain at the centre. The key issues will need to be identified rapidly and addressed in a transparent and inclusive way. We should be aware of each other interests and constraints, focus on what is doable, consider new ways of engaging in order to move ahead more efficiently, and be prepared to review longstanding negotiating positions. The ministers welcomed the process set in motion in Geneva towards reaching these objectives and concurred that this shift in gear has to be sustained by a high level of engagement by all Members, also in capitals. Some of them also mentioned the importance of delivering concrete outcomes in plurilateral initiatives, on a most favoured nation (MFN) basis, such as the amendment of the Information Technology Agreement.',\n",
       " \"Trade Leaders Urge WTO to Seize ‘Critical Moment’ in Doha Negotiations By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 26, 2015 Jan. 23 — International trade negotiators must take a fresh look at the 2001 Doha Round and be realistic about what needs to be achieved, World Trade Organization DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo . “We cannot just resume this conversation by getting the old discussions, dusting the books and reading the old positions—the world has changed,” Azevedo  during a Jan. 23 panel discussion at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). If WTO members are able to agree to a detailed work program by July 31, “we will be well positioned to conclude the [Doha] round in a short period of time,” he . On Jan. 24, Azevedo will meet with 30 WTO members at a “miniministerial” meeting in Davos, Switzerland, aimed at resolving the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement and the Doha Round. ‘Honest, Frank Discussion.’ The WTO is facing a “critical moment” where members need to have an “honest, frank discussion” about what they are able to agree to, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in his WEF panel remarks. “Members need to evaluate the state of the Doha Round of trade negotiations and decide whether they will take into account the changes that have taken place over the past decade or two,” he . Froman comments echo his recent blog post that called on WTO members to coalesce around common principles in the Doha Development Agenda or risk unraveling the multilateral trade liberalization effort (15 WTO, 1/23/15). Froman  that no one should be able to block the goal of trade liberalization as long as there are willing partners. The U.S. is simultaneously negotiating broad free trade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that could provide for many of the goals of the Doha Round. The conclusion of these deals may accelerate if Congress grants President Barack Obama increased trade promotion authority via legislation. Plurilateral Prospects Azevedo  that the WTO is not threatened by regional and megaregional trade agreements like the TPP and the TTIP. “They complement, not substitute what we do,” he . “The real threat to the WTO system is the WTO itself,” Azevedo . “We have to begin to deliver results that are meaningful and have significance to all members.” As for the Doha Round, members need to be realistic about what can be achieved, Azevedo . “If at the end of the conversation if members agree this is unachievable then they have to handle that and they have to decide what do we do.” Core Disagreements “The problem with the WTO is the number of countries—160 is tough,”  Mustapa Mohamed, Malaysia minister of International Trade and Industry. Mohamed  that members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are becoming anxious and will continue to seek plurilateral trade deals in the absence of a broad multilateral accord. “We have been stuck in Doha for 10 ,” he . “We don't want to be stuck forever.” Azevedo  that the size of the WTO membership is not an obstacle to dealmaking. “If there were 12 members, it would be same,” he . “There are deep differences in the core group. If you help resolve the differences in the core group, you could help multilateral trade liberalization.” U.S. Accepts TFA Froman subsequently presented Azevedo with the U.S. letter of acceptance for the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in a press conference following the WEF panel. The TFA aims to simplify customs procedures by streamlining customs formalities and issuing advanced custom duties rulings, which proponents claim will provide a nearly $1 trillion boost to the global economy. The U.S. becomes the third WTO member to ratify the TFA, following Singapore and Hong Kong. The TFA will enter into force after twothirds of the WTO 160 members ratify the deal. Although members would like to see full TFA ratification before the end of 2015, U.S. and European Union officials previously  that it could take up to five  to reach the twothirds threshold.\",\n",

Rachmat  some of the member countries were giving an impression to conclude the Doha Development Round at the 10<sup>th</sup> WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairoby, Kenya, in December 2015. Meanwhile, Rachmat added, other countries wanted to focus the attention on postBali working program. \"We pointed out that the Bali Package should not be left out. All of its elements must be implemented to maintain trust,\" Rachmat . Rachmat claimed that the Bali Package was a winwin solution for developed and developing countries after the Doha Round was in a deadlock in 2001. The trade agreement, set forth in the Bali Package, covers three sectors, namely trade, agriculture and less developed countries capacity (LDC). Indonesian Ambassador to the WTO, Iman Pambagio, added that one of the reasons for insisting on the Bali Package was that there was a new confidence to continue the world trade system initiated by the WTO. \"The Bali Package that was urged to be implemented accounts only 78 percent of the issues at the Doha Development Round,\" he .',\n",

The CS says ratification of the agreement will be an  step in setting the stage for a successful conference in Nairobi. “By the time of MC10, Kenya and Africa would like to see that members of the WTO have completed their domestic ratification processes and deposited their instruments of ratification with the WTO DirectorGeneral,” she stated. “As host of the WTO Conference, I will communicate personally and directly with all WTO members, and reach out to African ministers in particular, with an appeal that they ratify before Nairobi.” To facilitate the delivery of substantive outcomes during the 10th ministerial conference in Nairobi, the Cabinet Secretary stressed the need for consensus on a broadbased, balanced PostBali work programme that responds to the imperatives of the global economy by July. The Cabinet Secretary was speaking in Davos, Switzerland, during the WTO informal miniministerial meeting hosted by the Swiss Federal Chancellor, Schneider Amman, and WTO Director, General Roberto Azevêdo. She assured trade ministers attending the meeting that preparations are on top gear for the MC10 in Nairobi saying that all relevant government departments are fully engaged in order to ensure a successful conference. “Our Mission in Geneva is fully engaged with other African missions and is working in full coordination with the WTO Secretariat Team – some of whom will be in Nairobi very soon – to engage with the Kenyan MC10 taskforce in the capital,” she .',\n",
       " 'India, US to enhance engagement on IPR New Delhi, Jan 25 (PTI) India and the US today agreed to enhance their engagement on intellectual property rights, a vexed issue between the two countries. Visiting US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reaffirmed the importance of providing transparent and predictable policy environment for fostering innovation. \"Both countries reiterated their interest in sharing information and best practices on IPR issues, and reaffirmed their commitment to stakeholders\\' consultations on policy matters concerning intellectual property protection,\" a joint statement issued after the meeting of the two leaders . Recognising the progress made in constructive engagement on intellectual property under the last round of the IndiaUS Trade Policy Forum held in November last , the two sides also looked forward to enhance \"engagement on IPR in 2015 under the High Level Working Group on IP, to the mutual benefit of both the countries,\" the statement . The statement assumes significance as the US companies have alleged that India IPR regime is discriminatory, particularly for pharmaceutical industry. India has consistently maintained its stand that its laws are compliant with global and WTO norms. India is also in the process of formulating a comprehensive policy on IPR. A sixmember think tank has already submitted the first draft report on that. Under the Trade Policy Forum, India and the US have set up a highlevel working group on intellectual property. The TPF is the principal trade dialogue body between the countries. It has five focus groups: Agriculture, Investment, Innovation and Creativity, Services, and Tariff and NonTariff Barriers. On April 30, the US had brought out the Special 301 report, an annual review of the global state of IPR protection and enforcement, in which it has classified India as a \\'priority watch list country\\'. On the report, India had  that the Special 301 process is a unilateral measure taken by the US under their Trade Act, 1974 to create pressure on countries to increase IPR protection beyond the TRIPS agreement. Earlier, the US industry had also raised the matter of India rejection of patents for BristolMyers Squibb Sprycel and Novartis AG Glivec. It expressed concerns over issuance of a single compulsory license (CL) by India. The concern identified in the USA report are based on the inputs provided by the American industry on their perception of the level of protection provided by India to Intellectual Property. Issues that have been flagged in the report include, concerns over the provision of section 3(d) of the Patent Act, CL, inclusion of a statement relating to CL for green technologies in India National Manufacturing Policy and challenges relating to enforcement of IP Rights. Section 3(d) of the India Patent Act 1970 does not allow patent to be granted to inventions involving new forms of a known substance unless it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.

       " 'Ukraine crisis: Obama threatens more Russia sanctions Roman Olearchyk in Kiev and Victor Mallet in New Delhi Financial Times January 25, 2015 4:47 pm President Barack Obama has signalled that he was prepared to significantly increase US sanctions against the Kremlin, saying Saturday’s attack by separatist rebels on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol was clearly backed, equipped and financed by Russia. Mr Obama’s statement, made on Sunday at a news conference in New Delhi with India prime minister Narendra Modi, came as Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, met his security council in Kiev and urged the international community to increase pressure on Russia. Mr Obama  the US was “deeply concerned” about the latest break in the ceasefire and the separatists had received “Russian backing, Russian equipment, Russian financing, Russian training and Russian troops”. He added: “I will look at all additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation and try to address this issue.” Despite the strong rhetoric from the White House, it was unclear whether the EU — the Obama administration’s most  ally on Russia policy — was prepared to follow suit. According to EU diplomats, capitals were divided over whether to pursue more sanctions. Federica Mogherini, the high representative, has called an emergency meeting of foreign ministers for Thursday. Some diplomats had balked at the idea of convening an earlier meeting for fear it would result in little more than a further condemnation of the Mariupol attack. “To call it just to adopt another statement makes no sense,”  a Polish diplomat. Among those reluctant to call a quick meeting without “deliverables” was Donald Tusk, the European Council president, who  on Twitter that Mariupol showed that “appeasement encourages the aggressor”. Still, the feverish diplomacy over whether to move towards new sanctions reflected a shift in tenor for the west, particularly in Europe, where some leaders had started the  openly discussing lifting sanctions on Russia because of the crumbling Russian economy, which had been brought low by tumbling oil prices and value of the rouble. “We have no interest in seeing Russia weakened or its economy in a shambles,” Mr Obama . “We have a profound interest, as I believe every country does, in promoting a core principle, which is: large countries don’t bully smaller countries, they don’t encroach on their territorial integrity, they don’t encroach on their sovereignty. And that’s what’s at stake in Ukraine.” The attack on Mariupol included multiple salvos of rocket fire by proRussia separatists, which pounded civilian neighbourhoods in the Ukrainiancontrolled port city, killing 30 and injuring nearly 100. The assault has heightened fears that Russia, through separatist proxies, aims to secure a land bridge stretching along the Azov Sea to Crimea, which it annexed early last . ProMoscow separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated the political turmoil that threatens to tear the country apart Further reading The attack came a day after a senior separatist leader ruled out further ceasefire talks and vowed to recapture additional cities in Ukraine’s industrial east. The escalated fighting along the entire perimeter of separatistheld territory in past weeks threatens to plunge the 10month conflict that has claimed more than 5,000 lives back into fullscale warfare. On Sunday, Russia showed no sign of backing down. In statements put out by the Kremlin after Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, spoke with his US and EU counterparts, Moscow pinned blame for the heightened violence on Kiev for refusing to engage directly with separatist leadership. The Russian foreign ministry accused Kiev of violating the September Minsk ceasefire agreements and of pursuing a “course towards further militarisation”. In addition to Mr Obama publicly citing Russian involvement in the Mariupol attack, security chiefs in Kiev claimed to hold evidence implicating Russian operatives in the rocket fusillade.

Azevedo met with highlevel trade ministers from 21 WTO member countries at a Jan. 24 “miniministerial” meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss ways to advance a detailed workprogram by the July 31 deadline set by WTO members last . The ministers are interested in forging new agreements on thorny trade issues—like agriculture, nonagricultural market access and services—that have bogged down the organization work for , Azevedo told reporters after the meeting. “I heard things in recent days that I have not heard in many ,” he . Participants in the meeting included trade ministers from Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, the European Union, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and the U.S. Azevedo next plans to hold an informal heads of delegation meeting Jan. 29 in Geneva. ‘Cards on the Table.’ “Ministers now fully understand that we can't continue to dust off tired positions on the issue of agriculture, industrial goods and services,” Azevedo told reporters. “We need to understand that it is not enough to say what you want, you also have to say what you are ready to give,” he . “This is crucial for us to move forward.” Azevedo told the trade ministers to instruct their ambassadors in Geneva to “stop speaking in general terms and to engage on the specifics.” Azevedo also urged them to give their ambassadors the “green light to take risks and to put their cards on the table,” he . “Our goal is to prepare a very detailed work program,” Azevedo . “We want it to be as specific as possible so that if we deliver that we should be in a position then to conclude the negotiations in a short period of time.” ‘Change the Conversation.’ The trade ministers agreed that there is a need to change the course of the 2001 Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and consider the realities of today, Azevedo . “Up to now the conversations were mostly about who was or who was not in a position to do what we had agreed in 2008,” he . “There was a lot of finger pointing and a lot of accusations from one side and the other about who was doing this and who was doing that.” “We decided to change the conversation,” Azevedo . “We are going to have to now look at the world today and say ‘Where are we? What are the things that are actually doable, the things that are feasible at this time? What can we do? How far can we get? How ambitious are we in the different areas?’\\u2009” “I think that people are open minded and at this point we don't know what that conversation is going to yield,” he . No Plan B Azevedo left the door open to further negotiations if members fail to deliver by July 31 a detailed work program, as they failed to do by the Dec. 31, 2014, deadline set by ministers at the Bali Ministerial Conference. “If we don't get to formal modalities by July we will have to see how far we are and then decide what the next step will be,” Azevedo . Members have no plans to abandon the Doha Round despite their inability to find much common ground since 2008, he . “This is not about throwing all the work that we have done out the window. It is never going to happen,” he . “On the contrary what we want to do is build on what we have done already—preserve as much as possible the work we have done and developed over the .”\",\n",
       " \"WTO Members to Consider Proposals on Agriculture, Public Stockholding By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 27, 2015 Jan. 26 — World Trade Organization members will convene this week to discuss the latest negotiations regarding agricultural market access and public stockholding for food security purposes. On Jan. 28 WTO Agriculture Committee Chairman John Adank of New Zealand will hold an informal meeting followed by a dedicated session to discuss the public stockholding issue. The meetings come as WTO members aim to deliver a detailed work program on the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement and the Doha Development Agenda by July 31. Members are seeking to resolve the thorny issues of agriculture and public stockholding rules that have contributed, in part, to the breakdown of the 2001 Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Agriculture Negotiations Adank  he hopes attendees of the informal agricultural negotiations meeting will focus on the issues of market access and domestic support in their effort to achieve the July 31 goal. Members are considering a proposal, known as the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev.4), from the group of 33 developing nations (G33) that seeks flexibility for developing countries to initiate a more limited opening of agriculture markets. Countries such as India insist that Rev.4 is the logical starting point for any negotiations aimed at resolving the Doha Round (14 WTO, 1/22/15). In contrast, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  such an offer no longer makes sense in a world where India and China have become the top two users of tradedistorting agricultural subsidies (15 WTO, 1/23/15). Members are considering a proposal on special products whereby developing countries are given extra flexibility in market access for food, livelihood security and rural development. Members are also considering matters related to a special safeguard mechanism that would allow developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily in special situations. Public Stockholding The Jan. 28 session on public stockholding for food security purposes will focus on how members can find a permanent solution to the matter by the end of 2015. Members are seeking to update the WTO 19861988 pricing benchmark used to calculate trade distortion measures related to agricultural subsidies. Disagreement over an interim agreement forged at the 2013 Bali Ministerial led India to oppose the Trade Facilitation Agreement last July. A November 2014 agreement forged by U.S. and India trade officials resolved the impasse by extending indefinitely a socalled “peace clause” on developing countries' stockholding programs and setting a Dec. 31, 2015, target to arrive at a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue (230 WTO, 12/1/14).\",\n",

       " 'India, US to battle it out at WTO over solar policy D. Ravi Kanth 27 January 2015 Mint Geneva, Jan. 27 Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama signed an agreement on Sunday to promote clean energy and expand solar energy initiatives, a move widely seen as giving US companies access to the lucrative India market, the two countries are preparing to slug it out in the World Trade Organization (WTO) over India solar policy. Next week, a dispute settlement panel of the WTO will commence hearings on a trade dispute between Washington and New Delhi over the India government imposition of local content requirements for solar cells and solar modules under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM). The panel, which will be chaired by former New Zealand trade envoy David Walker, will begin its proceedings on 3 February when the US will make its first submission as to how India violated WTO commitments by implementing JNNSM. In its dispute notification, the US has charged India with imposing national content requirements and denial of national treatment for solar cells and solar modules. The US has also complained that India provides subsidies to its domestic producers involved in the manufacture of solar cells and solar modules. WTO members are not supposed to insist on national content requirements that discriminate against foreign products. Governments are also required to provide national treatment, under which imports must be treated on par with domestically manufactured products. The US claims that the India government measures to impose national content provisions and deny national treatment have impaired benefits accruing to American companies. The WTO dispute settlement proceedings will go on for several months and a preliminary ruling will be issued in six months. In New Delhi, a senior India government official  on condition of anonymity that India wouldn\\'t budge from its stand at the WTO. \"Without support from the government, our domestic industry can\\'t survive,\"  the official. Interestingly, Chinese and Taiwanese firms may be slapped with an antidumping duty by the US after the US International Trade Commission on Wednesday ruled that their photovoltaic product shipments had hurt US domestic manufacturers. India has rolled out an ambitious campaign to promote solar energy by enlisting the India Army, India Railways and central public sector units in the effort and providing them with grants on the condition that they source solar equipment from domestic manufacturers. According to the plan, reviewed by Mint, the government will provide financial support of up to Rs.1 crore per megawatt (MW) to the implementing agency for setting up large solar capacities by placing orders with domestic manufacturers. It requires an investment of around Rs.8 crore per MW for setting up solar photovoltaic power projects. JNNSM was launched by the previous Congress government four  ago and aims to promote ecologically sustainable growth while addressing India energy security challenges. Gujarat, where Modi was chief minister before becoming prime minister last , was the first state to implement the mission. Although the US has made a strong case about the loss of commercial gains to its domestic producers of solar cells and solar modules in the India market, Washington too, has resorted to similar measures, including local content requirements and a range of subsidies for promoting its renewable energy sector at the federal, state, regional, and local levels. India has raised the issue repeatedly against the US at the WTO committee on subsidies and countervailing measures, stating that American subsidy schemes relating to local or domestic content requirements are inconsistent with its global trade obligations. New Delhi has provided a fivepage questionnaire listing out US programmes such as solar energy credits that are contingent upon compliance with domestic content requirements. But the India government has refrained from raising a trade dispute against the US on its WTOinconsistent programmes in the renewable energy sector despite collecting evidence about the US subsidy regime and the country local content provisions. Against the backdrop of the ModiObama agreement to promote clean energy and increase cooperation in solar energy initiatives, trade lawyers are asking whether the US is prepared to suspend the dispute against India on solar cells and solar modules. \"The dispute settlement understanding in Article 12.12 states that the panel proceedings can be stopped anytime at request of the complaining party,\"  a trade lawyer who asked not to be identified. \"If there is political will due to changed circumstances or new understanding between the two leaders, then the US can simply call for the suspension of panel proceedings,\" the lawyer added. The way the USIndia trade dispute on solar cells goes could well decide whether genuine national necessities and bilateral initiatives to promote renewable energy eventually triumph over mercantile commercial concerns.',\n",

Earlier in the day, at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Obama was the first U.S. president to attend India annual Republic Day parade, a show of military might that has been associated with Cold War antiAmericanism. It rained as troops, tanks and cultural floats filed through the heart of New Delhi, but excitement nevertheless ran high over Obama visit, which began on Sunday with a clutch of deals to unlock billions of dollars in nuclear trade and to deepen defence ties. Both sides hope to build enough momentum to forge a relationship that will help balance China rise by catapulting democratic India into the league of major world powers. The leaders talked on first name terms, recorded a radio programme together and spent hours speaking at different events, but despite the bonhomie, Obama and Modi reminded business leaders, including the head of PepsiCo, that trade ties were still fragile. India accounts for only 2 percent of U.S. imports and one percent of its exports, Obama . While annual bilateral trade had reached $100 billion, that is less than a fifth of U.S. trade with China. \"We are moving in the right direction ... That , we also know that the U.S.India relationship is defined by so much untapped potential,\" Obama told the India and U.S. business leaders. \"Everyone here will agree, we\\'ve got to do better.\" Modi  U.S. investment in India had doubled in the past four months and vowed to do more to slash the country notorious red tape and make it one of the world easiest places for business. Obama  that U.S. ExportImport Bank would finance $1 billion in exports of \\'MadeinAmerica\\' products. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation will lend $1 billion to small and mediumsized enterprises in rural areas of India. Regarding renewable energy, a key focus for Modi, $2 billion will be committed by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency for renewable energy, Obama . Most significant was an agreement on issues that, despite a groundbreaking 2006 pact, had stopped U.S. companies from setting up nuclear reactors in India and had become one of the major irritants in bilateral relations. \"Mobama breaks Ndeadlock,\" ran the frontpage headline of the Mail Today newspaper, which carried a photograph of Modi and Obama hugging each other warmly. GLOBAL REACH Obama and Modi sat behind a rainspotted screen as the parade unfolded along Rajpath, an elegant lawnbordered boulevard dating from the British colonial era that connects the presidential palace to India Gate. Helicopters showered petals on the crowds, and then tanks, missiles, stiffly saluting soldiers, brass bands and dancers filed past the guests. Obama presence at the parade signals Modi willingness to end India traditional reluctance to get too close to any big power. Instead, he is seeking close ties with them all, even as he pushes back against China and take sides on other global issues. Modi has injected a new vitality into the economy and foreign relations since his May elections. Obama second visit to India is the latest upturn in a rollercoaster relationship with Washington that a  ago was scarred by protectionism and a fiery diplomatic spat. The United States views India as a vast market and potential counterweight to China assertiveness, but has been frustrated with the pace of New Delhi economic reforms. \"There are still too many barriers, hoops to jump through, bureaucratic restrictions that make it hard to start a business, or to export, to import, to close a deal, deliver on a deal,\" Obama told a forum of CEOs from both countries in New Delhi. In a joint statement that made a veiled reference to China territorial claims, Modi and Obama stated their commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. India could even play a role in battling Islamic State, the White House  on Monday, underlining the confidence that New Delhi is increasingly prepared to engage with global security. \"The leaders agreed to exchange information on individuals returning from these conflict zones and to continue to cooperate in protecting and responding to the needs of civilians caught up in these conflicts,\" the two sides  in a joint statement. They also agreed to a 10 framework for defence ties and struck deals on cooperation that included joint production of drone aircraft and equipment for Lockheed Martin Corp C130 military transport plane.

       " 'TPP talks resume as U.S., Japan aim for deal by spring Kyodo News NEW YORK, Jan. 26 Chief negotiators for a 12country Pacific Rim free trade initiative resumed their talks Monday in New York, as the United States and Japan push to reach a broad deal by around this spring. The weeklong session of TransPacific Partnership negotiations is seen as an opportunity to resolve all but politically sensitive issues that need to be discussed at the ministerial level. Officials see this spring as an effective deadline for ending the fiveold talks given the United States will enter campaign mode later this  for the 2016 presidential election. The focus is on whether the top negotiators can bridge the gaps on contentious issues, such as intellectual property rights, tariffs and establishing unified rules for fair business competition, and set the stage for a ministerial meeting to secure a deal. Koji Tsuruoka, Japan chief TPP negotiator, told reporters before leaving for New York last week he \"has no doubt\" that the TPP countries will be able to see the prospect of setting a ministerial meeting \"if Japan and the United States, which are the major economies (in the TPP framework), can collaborate and make utmost efforts to conclude the negotiations.\" Tsuruoka also noted the United States, which leads the TPP talks, has started to show its \"seriousness\" about sealing a pact. Last Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed his eagerness in his annual State of the Union Address to conclude the U.S.led TPP talks, urging Congress to give him the fasttrack trade promotion authority to secure a pact. The envisioned Trade Promotion Authority legislation is seen as necessary to promoting TPP talks as it would allow the president for up to seven  to urge Congress to endorse a trade pact without any amendment. But another obstacle to concluding a deal is bickering between Japan and the United States which together account for some 80 percent of gross domestic product in the TPP scheme over market access for agricultural products and autos. A bilateral agreement between Tokyo and Washington is also seen as vital for securing the broader agreement.',\n",
       " 'U.S. News: Currency Battle Holds Back Pacific Trade Talks By William Mauldin 27 January 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe Concern that some trade partners are manipulating their currencies to gain an export edge has emerged as a major hurdle to the Obama administration efforts to move a Pacific trade agreement through Congress. Sharp disagreements over whether rules on currency manipulation should be included in trade deals pit the White House and multinational companies, which oppose such measures, against scores of lawmakers from both parties, labor unions and U.S.based manufacturers. Critics say a deal under negotiation with Japan and 10 other Pacific countries should include enforceable rules to deter trading partners from directly intervening in currency markets to obtain a trade advantage. Any gains American companies get from the lower tariffs negotiated in trade deals, skeptics fear, could be wiped away if foreign countries take steps to weaken their currencies as they have in the past, making their own products more competitive. The issue is all the more pressing as the U.S. dollar has soared in recent months against most other major currencies. \"The 21stcentury trade barrier is currency manipulation,\" Ziad Ojakli, a Ford Motor Co. vice president,  Thursday at the Washington Auto Show. \"This marketdistorting practice has the effect of subsidizing foreign exports to the U.S., while blocking Americanmade products sold overseas.\" The Obama administration has  it prefers to handle currency manipulation through the Treasury Department and via international forums including the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 20 biggest global economies. Officials worry that binding rules on currencies, even if narrowly tailored, could lead to challenges of U.S. and other countries\\' monetary policies, including the use of asset purchases to stimulate the economy. The U.S. hasn\\'t declared another country a currency manipulator in . Many lawmakers, unions and American exporters say officials have dropped the ball on upholding currency principles enshrined in the IMF and other international agreements. Lawmakers see congressional votes this  on the TransPacific Partnership trade deal and related legislation known as fast track as the best opportunity to put enforcement teeth on the IMF principles. A spokesman for the office of U.S. Trade Representative Mike Froman referred questions on the issue to the Treasury Department. \"The Treasury Department continues to address currency issues in multilateral and bilateral settings,\" a spokeswoman , adding that the administration \"remains focused on making more progress.\" Business groups accuse the currency critics of trying to undermine Mr. Obama trade policy any way they can. \"It an easy out for members who just don\\'t want to support trade agreements,\"  John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, composed of chief executives of leading U.S. companies. Traditional Democratic concerns about labor and the environment have been soothed by Mr. Froman insistence he is backing strong rules in those areas in negotiations with the 11 Pacific countries, which include Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia. The talks could conclude early this . Mr. Engler, a former Michigan governor, concedes that the currency issue can\\'t be ignored and \"Congress understands that.\" Nonbinding currency language was included in a version of fast track that died last , and some sort of currency objective is expected in a new version of the legislation that committee leaders are hammering out this , according to people following the talks. The currency conundrum is raising eyebrows as the dollar continues a three rally against trading partners\\' currencies. Each gain of 1% against a tradeweighted basket takes a toll on the U.S. current account, a broad measure of trade and financial flows, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That translates to a hit of $35 billion over two or three , the nonpartisan think tank estimates. \"Why would we pursue new trade agreements if the deck is already stacked against us?\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio)  through a spokeswoman. He and 59 other senators from both parties wrote a letter last  asking Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Mr. Froman to address currency manipulation in the Pacific talks. A similar letter had broad support in the House. The auto industry has backed a proposal to penalize countries based on a measure of their centralbank reserves and current accounts, which can offer a window on potential currency manipulation. The group that represents Detroit big producers  it would oppose fast track and the TransPacific Partnership without some sort of enforceable rules. \"This is an issue that clearly needs to be dealt with in trade agreements, but it has to be dealt with overall,\"  Leo Gerard, president of United Steelworkers, which represents 850,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada. Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee that oversees trade,  Thursday that the administration appears to be \"hesitant but increasingly open to having a conversation\" on the topic.

       " \"WTO Members Frustrated With ‘Systemic’ Delays of Dispute Settlement Body Reports By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 28, 2015 Jan. 27 — Several key members of the World Trade Organization complained about the systemic lateness of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) reports in recent meetings in Geneva. In five of the last six WTO disputes, the Appellate Body has not circulated its reports within 90 days as mandated in Article 17.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). Such delays present financial difficulties for countries awaiting investigations of trade barriers with big impacts on their industries' bottom lines. If the DSB does not address such delays it could erode the transparency and accountability of the WTO rulesbased system, the members . Lack of Transparency The U.S.  it was particularly concerned that the Appellate Body failed to consult with parties of the recent Argentina trade restrictions case when it became clear that the review would breach the 90day time limit. “It would also appear that a step has been taken backwards with respect to transparency, as compared with other reports, in that this report does not even mention this issue in its introductory section,” the U.S.  in its remarks at a Jan. 26 Dispute Settlement Body meeting. The U.S.  it would have preferred if the Appellate Body consulted with members and sought an agreement about a time extension rather than issue a form letter notifying the parties that it would not issue the report within the 90day timelimit. “A situation in which members continue to be informed of and react to circulation of reports in circumstances such as these only further contributes to a lack of transparency and a lack of predictability,” the U.S. . Others Echo Concern Australia urged greater consultations with parties in the event of a delay and sought to encourage as few departures from normal appellate timeframes as possible. “Adherence to timeframes underpins the predictability of the system and is critical in government and commercial decisionmaking,” according to its intervention at the Jan. 26 meeting. Japan  it regretted the DSB lack of consultation about the timing of the report, something that had been common practice prior to 2011. “In this regard, Japan believes that providing opportunity for consultations is  due process, in particular, in the current circumstance under which the Appellate Body is required to deal with [a] high amount of works,” it  in its intervention. “Some might like to believe that since the 90 days we originally set aside for appeals has become increasingly unrealistic, we can simply wave away a strict provision of the DSU,”  Canada in its intervention. “We do not share that view.” Canada noted that “a small group of delegations” has been working on proposals to ameliorate the problem though no solutions have been identified. Taiwan asked members whether it is time to “give some serious thought to how to improve the efficiency of the dispute proceedings, without prejudice to the accuracy and quality of the dispute settlement reports,” according to its intervention. ‘Insurmountable Bottleneck.' The issue doesn't surprise WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo, who bemoaned the “insurmountable bottleneck” of appeals facing the DSB. He noted that the total number of active proceedings being serviced by the WTO Legal Affairs Division, Rules Division, and the Appellate Body Secretariat has roughly doubled since 2012. Azevedo  he expects that nearly a dozen appeals will be filed every  for the next two , including possible appeals in the two complex aircraft cases between the U.S. and the European Union. Last , Azevedo offered 15 new positions in the WTO dispute settlement divisions and has recruited 17 junior attorneys since 2013 for temporary contracts to replace outgoing employees.\",\n",
       " 'Top U.S. trade negotiator says Pacific pact nearly ready * U.S. Trade Representative says Congress should pass fasttrack * Lawmakers quiz Michael Froman on currency manipulation * Senate committee chair warns no Pacific pact before fasttrack By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) The top U.S. trade official told lawmakers on Tuesday an ambitious Pacific trade pact could be wrapped up within months as he urged Congress to back the administration trade agenda. In testimony to congressional committees, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  the administration looked to lawmakers to pass bipartisan legislation allowing a streamlined approval process for trade deals, such as the 12nation TransPacific Partnership (TPP). TPP chief negotiators are meeting in New York this week and a U.S. negotiator  the talks aimed to close all but the trickiest issues. Some see a midMarch completion date. \"We are not done yet but I feel confident that we are making good progress and we can close out a positive package soon,\" Froman told the Senate Committee on Finance, adding parties aimed for a deal in a \"small number of months.\" Still, outstanding issues were \"significant.\" There was no consensus on how long to protect the exclusivity of biologic drugs and gaps on other intellectual property protections, environmental protection rules, investment and stateowned enterprises, he . At hearings with the Senate and House committees responsible for trade, both Republicans and Democrats  trade negotiations should seek to stop trading partners from manipulating their currencies. Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat,  he would not support the TPP without action on currencies. Froman  Treasury had the lead on exchange rates and was pushing the issue oneonone and in international forums. The White House plans to seal a trade agreement covering 40 percent of the world economy and fasttrack legislation in 2015 face opposition from some Democrats worried about the impact on jobs at home and some conservative Republicans opposed to giving President Barack Obama more power. During the House committee hearing, lawmakers brandished cheese and car keys to represent local industries potentially affected by trade deals. Froman  officials were consulting with stakeholders every step of the way. Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance,  it would be a \"grave mistake\" to close TPP before securing trade promotion authority (TPA), which allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for a yesorno vote, without amendments, in exchange for setting negotiating goals.',\n",
       " 'Delhi: U.S. to Pull WTO Case By Saurabh Chaturvedi 28 January 2015 The Wall Street Journal Asia NEW DELHI India expects the U.S. to withdraw its complaint at the World Trade Organization against localpurchasing rules in its federal solar program, as the growth of the South Asian nation solar sector will likely mean more business opportunities for American companies, a senior government official  Tuesday. A dispute settlement panel at the WTO is due to hear complaints made by the U.S. against India federal solar program on Feb. 3. Under India program, known as Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, the country aims to raise solar power generation capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2022 from about three gigawatts now. After coming to power in May, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi government raised the target under the solar program to 100 gigawatts from 20 gigawatts, as the country aims to boost the use of clean sources of energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels such as coal to generate electricity. India imports threequarters of its overall energy needs. \"The program has grown bigger and has created more opportunities for the American companies to take part and build solar projects in India,\" the official added. \"The U.S. has an option to withdraw the complaint or keep it in cold storage,\" the government official from India ministry of new and renewable energy told The Wall Street Journal. \"Our position is clear and we would continue to defend it at the WTO.\" U.S. authorities couldn\\'t be reached to comment. The U.S. earlier  that India is unfairly restricting access to American suppliers as it moves ahead with the largescale solarpower program through localpurchasing rules. India says rules are limited to only a small portion of the program and are WTOcompliant. The news comes as U.S. President Barack Obama concludes a threeday trip to India, during which he  U.S. companies are eager to participate in India plan to boost the use of renewable energy, including solar. The official  India in August dropped a plan to impose antidumping tariffs on solar cells imported from four countries, including the U.S. \"That in itself was a boost for American companies,\" he added.',\n",
       " 'India wants to keep US chicken legs out 28 January 2015 The Times of India Mumbai Edition India has challenged a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, asking it to lift a ban on the import of poultry from the US, a move aimed at helping check shipment of lowcost chicken legs, which are discarded in America as they are perceived as having higher cholesterol levels. Although a decision on filing an appeal had been taken by the commerce department earlier, the actual plea was delayed due to legal vetting and news about it trickled out only after US president Barack Obama left for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday . India had banned poultry imports several  ago, citing avian influenza, but the WTO accepted the US challenge and termed the restrictions imposed as \"unscientific\". India is not the only country to have imposed such checks. Even China had levied duties, and was asked to remove them by WTO as they were seen to be unfair. Unlike India, where \"tangri kebabs\" are a hot favourite, in US, consumers prefer \"white meat\" and opt for chicken breast. As a result, there are surplus chicken legs and thighs for American companies to export to countries such as China, Mexico and Russia, where buyers are less fussy . In India, of course, everyone at the dinner table searches for leg piece in curry , which is often elusive. As a result, not only there is a higher demand for leg pieces in India but even costs are lower if they are import ed from the US. Government estimates suggest that despite 100% import duty, leg pieces from US will cost around Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. However, in cities such as Delhi, chicken produced at domestic market sells for at least Rs 160170 a kg, while drumsticks and leg pieces cost close to Rs 250 a kg. As demand for protein rises with increasing income levels, meat prices are expected to rise further and the domestic poultry industry is citing livelihood concerns to press the government for action. Although the government sees merit in challenging the WTO ruling, it is not averse to other steps to check import of chicken legs.',\n",

After nearly a  firmly positioned at seventh spot, the yuan reached a record high share of 2.17 percent in global payments by value and is in sight of the Japanese yen, which has a share of 2.69 percent. The U.S. dollar, euro and British pound remain the top three world payment currencies. \"It is a great testimony to the internationalisation of the RMB and confirms its transition from an \\'emerging\\' to a \\'business as usual\\' payment currency,\" Wim Raymaekers, Head of Banking Markets at SWIFT  in a statement. The rise of various offshore yuan clearing centres around the world, including eight new agreements signed with the People Bank of China last , was an  driver fuelling this growth. Global yuan payments increased by 20.3 percent in value in December compared to a  earlier, while the growth for payments across all currencies was 14.9 percent for the same period, SWIFT . Over the last , yuan payments grew in value by 102 percent compared to an overall ly growth for all currencies of 4.4 percent. China is expected to make another push for the inclusion of the yuan in the International Monetary Fund inhouse currency basket in a review later this  and this time round its G20 partners may be willing to listen. The main argument against its inclusion in the Special Drawing Rights, a basket of yen, dollars, pounds and euro used as the IMF inhouse unit of account, is that the yuan is far from freely \"usable\" or convertible.

       " \"One Step Forward, Two Backward in WTO Negotiations on Agriculture By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 29, 2015 Jan. 28 — World Trade Organization members arrived at mixed results during this week discussion of WTO rules regarding agricultural subsidies, market access and public stockholding for food security purposes. In a positive development, members considered a new proposal aimed at narrowing the differences over tradedistorting agricultural subsidy rules that could present new compromises in the debate over the December 2008 draft modalities, also known as Rev.4. The draft modalities contain formulas for cutting tariffs and tradedistorting subsidies and related provisions. Members, however, failed to break new ground in the contentious debate over changes to market access rules and public stockholding proposals during a pair of Jan. 28 WTO Agriculture Committee meetings held in Geneva. In total, the negotiations reflected members' conflicted resolve to advance a detailed work program by July 31 to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Domestic Support Proposal Nearly a dozen WTO members offered a new proposal to build upon Rev.4 by setting new limits in overall tradedistorting domestic support ceilings that may require the U.S. to change its policies regarding subsidies. The proposal would set a new domestic support ceiling for the U.S. at $14.5 billion which, if considered under the de minimis limits of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, would be in excess of about $4.37 billion. The U.S. would subsequently exceed its “amber box” limits by $3.6 billion and be forced to modify its domestic support policies accordingly. Under the proposal India, China, Japan, Australia and Brazil would not violate WTO domestic support limits if their policies remained constant. Members supporting the proposal included Australia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam. Australia and Canada  that they recognized that if the U.S. were to agree to such a proposal it would likely ask members for some sort of concession in return. That recognition in itself was a positive development from previous negotiations,  trade sources at the meeting. Market Access The subsequent debate over market access rules failed to advance two Group of 33 (G33) developing country proposals regarding special products and special safeguard mechanisms. The special products proposal seeks to provide developing countries with extra flexibility in market access for food, livelihood security and rural development. The special safeguard mechanism would allow developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily in special situations. The European Union  that there is a need for a simplified proposal that can balance out the disparities between high and low tariffs. Argentina suggested adopting a completely different proposal to increase transparency but declined to offer any details. Agriculture Committee Chairman John Adank called the discussion on market access a useful start but  that members need to offer more concrete ideas if they are to advance the discussion in a substantive way. Adank  that he would hold future consultations but did not schedule any official meetings. Public Stockholding Stalemate The G33 group reintroduced their July 2014 proposal regarding public stockholding for food security purposes to categorize price support in the “green box” of nontrade distorting subsidies. Under existing WTO rules, developing countries with stockholding programs for food security purposes must count any difference between the prices paid to farmers and external reference prices (dating from 198688) as tradedistorting subsidies. WTO members are prohibited from spending above a certain percentage of the value of their domestic agricultural production (de minimis limits) for these subsidies. Developing members like India are seeking to update the 19861988 WTO pricing benchmark used to calculate tradedistorting measures related to agricultural subsidies. Disagreement over an interim agreement forged at the 2013 Bali Ministerial led India to oppose the Trade Facilitation Agreement last July (148 WTO, 8/1/14). The U.S., EU, Brazil, Canada and Australia  that the G33 proposal was problematic because it would distort trade, in conflict with the terms of the Agreement on Agriculture. The U.S.  that it was disappointed that the G33 group had resubmitted a proposal that was rejected in earlier conversations. India countered that the proposal had not been rejected, it merely had not been considered. India further  that it was unwilling to reply to any questions until members engaged the proposal. The Jan. 28 meeting was the first dedicated discussion of public stockholding rules since U.S. and India trade officials agreed to extend indefinitely a socalled “peace clause” on developing countries' stockholding programs and set a Dec. 31, 2015, target to arrive at a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue (230 WTO, 12/1/14).\",\n",
       " 'India, US disagree over food security From Shreerupa Mitra Jha Geneva, Jan 28 (PTI) Disagreements flared up between the US and India here today at the first informal meeting to find a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security in developing countries. The G33 countries led by India and including China want public stockholding for food security purposes to come under the \"Green Box\" domestic support for agriculture that causes minimal or no trade distortion. Under current WTO rules, developing countries are subject to only minimal disciplines on agriculture subsidies. Other countries, including the US and Australia contend that price support is by definition market distorting. The US  that \"members cannot create a loophole in discipline\" and are disappointed that the G33 a group of developing countries that coordinate on trade and economic issues resubmitted a proposal that was rejected. India, on its part, argued that the proposal was never rejected. The EU  there are \"legitimate concerns\" both of food security and trade distorting impact. The main element of the G33 proposal is that acquisition of stocks of foodstuff by developing nations with an objective of supporting lowincome producers should not be included in the calculation of Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS), or the socalled \"trade distorting domestic support.\" Even though developing countries are allowed agricultural subsidies, another major area of concern has been the calculation of the AMS the difference between procurement price and the external reference price is treated as a subsidy to the farmer and included in the AMS. The external reference price is still calculated on the 198688 prices. Since food prices domestically and internationally have dramatically risen since the time, it effectively limits the governments capability to provide schemes for their small farmers. India had caused much furore among developed nations last  when it blocked the Trade Facilitation Agreement for cutting down red tape in global trade so its food security programme will not be challenged under WTO rules. India Rs 12billion food security programme, which is binding by law, is a key welfare measure aimed at delivering millions out of poverty by providing subsidies to consumers through the PDS, and the producers of food grains and also through subsidising through inputs like electricity. The logjam was broken by an interim peace clause in November 2014 that legally protected existing stockholding programmes of developing countries if purchases at government set prices take the countries\\' above the limits they have agreed for tradedistorting domestic support.

The development could pave the way for pursuing sectoral agreements in trade and investment, trade and competition policy, and ecommerce, among other areas. The decision came at a meeting on the margins of the World Economic Forum annual meeting last week in Davos, Switzerland. Trade ministers of the US, the European Union, New Zealand, South Africa, and World Trade Organization (WTO) director general Roberto Azevedo, among others, broadly agreed to scale down expectations to conclude Doha negotiations at the WTO 10th ministerial conference in Nairobi, Kenya, people familiar with the meeting outcome . US trade representative Michael Froman, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, New Zealand trade minister Tim Groser, South African trade minister Rob Davies, Azevedo and others discussed the broad contours of what is doable in the unfinished negotiations over dinner on Friday. On Saturday, at an informal meeting hosted by the Swiss government, the trade ministers announced their intent to conclude the Doha negotiations based on recalibration, a euphemism to lower the level of ambition, and what is doable during the next 11 months. The participants drawn from both advanced and developing countries agreed to accelerate negotiations to draw up the precise modalities in agriculture, industrial goods and services by the end of July with the aim of concluding a final agreement on 15 December at the WTO conference in Nairobi. The modalities will suggest the level of tariffs and subsidy reduction commitments in agriculture and tariff cuts in industrial goods, and the broad commitments in trade in services. \"We concurred that by July a detailed work programme will have to be defined, setting out a credible and realistic path towards a conclusion of the Doha Development Round,\" Switzerland economic affairs minister Johann N. SchneiderAmmann  at the end of the meeting. Countries that took part in the informal meeting include the US, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, China, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Australia, Russia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey and Thailand. India did not attend the meeting. \"Many members have expressed a desire to put Doha behind us and move on to other issues,\" South Africa Davies . \"Now there is an attempt to start serious dialogue which will identify what I can do and what I cannot dobasically doable versus not doable.\" The Doha negotiations were launched in 2001 by the US and the EU immediately after the 9/11 terror attack in New York. Despite intense opposition from several developing countries, particularly India, to the launch of the new broadbased Doha negotiations before implementation of the Uruguay Round commitments, the US and the EU went ahead, promising developing countries that their breadandbutter concerns in agriculture and other issues will be adequately addressed. But after 13  of negotiations, an attempt will now be made to reduce the level of commitments to a minimum from the grand scheme of promises made in 2001, the July 2004 framework agreement, the 2005 Hong Kong ministerial declaration, and the 2008 revised draft modalities in agriculture and industrial goods. The big industrialized countries, particularly the US, have raised fundamental opposition to the 2008 revised modalities on the ground that the realities in the global trading system have changed with the emergence of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia as major trading nations. \"The current negotiations, known as the \\'Doha Round\\', began in 2001 and haven\\'t kept pace with tectonic shifts in the global economy, most notably the rise of emerging economies,\" Froman wrote a day before the Davos meeting. The US and other industrialized countries insisted that emerging countries must undertake ambitious commitments in agriculture, industrial goods and services, contrary to what was mandated in the Doha agenda. Developing countries are upset over the concerted attempts to change the goal posts since 2008, but are not in a position to resist the onslaught from the powerful countries at this juncture, a South American trade envoy  on condition of anonymity. Against this backdrop, it is not realistically possible to achieve ambitious results in the Doha Round without what is called recalibration of the level of ambition. \"Recalibration would require a more honest and conducive dialogue,\"  the South African trade minister.',\n",

The WTO Secretariat cited Barbados use of electronic customs clearance procedures and mechanisms for advanced rulings and risk assessment in its report ahead of the trade policy review. The U.S. applauded Barbados effort to consolidate its sanitary and phytosanitary regulatory functions under a single government agency and to bring its animal health and food safety systems in line with international standards, Chris Wilson, deputy chief of the U.S. Mission in Geneva,  in a statement delivered during the review. “As Barbados is currently in the process of scheduling its [Trade Facilitation Agreement, or TFA] commitments, we look forward to Barbados TFA notification, and eventual acceptance of the TFA, and we stand ready to support Barbados with the scheduling process where we can,” Wilson . A top priority for the WTO 160 members in 2015 is to work with their governments to fully ratify the TFA in order to simplify customs procedures that proponents claim will provide up to a $1 trillion boost to the global economy. The U.S. is Barbados top trading partner and the twoway trade of goods in 2013 totaled $508 million. U.S. tourists contribute significantly to Barbados tourism sector, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the country gross domestic product. Government and financial services account for the rest. Other main trading partners of Barbados, a member of the Group of 33 developing countries, include the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago. High Budget Deficits Despite the progress, the WTO  that Barbados fiscal position “remains precarious,” as the country has “registered mounting fiscal deficits resulting in rising public debt” following the impact of the 2009 economic crisis. Barbados fiscal deficit rose from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008 to 12.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014. The deficit did decline to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, due in part to a temporary increase in tax revenue before rising again, the WTO Secretariat report . Though Barbados has embarked on a mixture of economic policy modifications aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability, the country “needs to make further efforts to streamline the continuing large number of tariff and tax concessions to investors,” the WTO Secretariat . The U.S. agreed with the WTO Secretariat suggestion for Barbados to address its high budget deficits through a mixture of expenditure reductions and increased revenue collection, Wilson . Other Changes Needed The U.S. encouraged Barbados to enter the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and urged the country to consider ways to streamline its import permit process. The U.S. also noted that Barbados had made no major changes to its intellectual property rights legislation over the review period and urged the country to make its legislation compatible with World Intellectual Property Organization treaties.

Mukhisa Kituyi, SecretaryGeneral of UNCTAD, in his letter to Roberto Azevedo, WTO Director General, welcomed this collaboration between the two organizations, which will allow the WTO Member States to supply information and data for the WTO IDB in an efficient and timely manner. WTO Integrated Database (IDB) contains data that member governments supply annually on the tariffs they apply normally under the nondiscrimination principle of mostfavoured nation (MFN). Data on lower preferential duties under free trade agreements or preferential schemes for developing countries are available for some members. Annual import statistics by country of origin are also available in the IDB. Developing countries are facing institutional, technical and human capacity limitations in fulfilling their notification requirements for the WTO. UNCTAD, through its Customs automation programme (ASYCUDA), will work closely with the WTO Secretariat to provide the interested Member States with specially developed electronic functions, allowing for easy extraction of properly structured data and its automatic forwarding to the WTO Integrated Database. In addition UNCTAD will provide technical assistance and related capacity building in extraction of national trade data and its transmission to the WTO in an agreed standard format. Beneficiaries of such technical assistance can be both the WTO Member States and acceding countries. In order to implement specific activities the two agencies will make special collaboration arrangements in each particular case, relying on donors support.

       " 'China to gradually reduce metal export quotas * Fewer metals will carry export quotas over time spokesman * No progress on decision about primary aluminium export tax (Adds aluminium) BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) China will over time reduce its export quotas for metals, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce  on Thursday, in a move aimed at complying with a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling that sees these curbs as discriminatory. The country was widely expected to abolish the quota system and taxes after the WTO ruling in March last  that  such export tariffs violated trade rules by giving domestic consumers an unfair advantage over foreign competitors. \"The trend is that fewer metals will carry export quotas over time,\" the spokesman Shen Danyang . When asked about China export tariff on primary aluminium, Shen  no progress had been made for now as any change to the tax structure would involve other departments and more research. China is the world top producer and consumer of primary aluminium and levies an export tax of 15 percent on the metal. Smelters have lobbied Beijing in past few  to cancel or cut the tax as the domestic market is oversupplied. Higher Chinese exports would support domestic metal prices <0#SAF:>, but drag on global aluminium futures that rose only about 3 percent last , retaining most of their sharp 13 percent drop from 2013. China has kept export quotas on tin, antimony, indium and silver this  after removing the quotas on exports of rare earths, molybdenum and tungsten.

       " 'India raises the stakes in trade battle against US Utpal Bhaskar 29 January 2015 Mint New Delhi, Jan. 29 India has raised the stakes in an ongoing trade battle with the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO), with stateowned NTPC Ltd calling bids for developing solar projects in Rajasthan, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh from domestic manufacturers. \"Only domestic manufacturers can participate in this NTPC tender,\" an India government official , requesting anonymity. Interestingly, the bids called by India largest power utility for developing 750 megawatt (MW) of solar photovoltaic projects in these states involving an investment of around Rs.6,000 crore was called on Saturday, a day before India and the US issued the statement that spoke of support to India ambitious green energy programme during US President Barack Obama visit. Obama visit comes amid a trade battle between India and the US at WTO, where a dispute settlement panel has been established to hear US complaints against India domestic content requirements on procurement of solar cells and modules under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission programme (JNNSM). The panel, which will be chaired by former New Zealand trade envoy David Walker, will begin its proceedings on 3 February when the US will make its first submission as to how India violated WTO commitments by implementing the JNNSM. The bid documents will be available from 4 February. According to the terms of the tender, these 250 MW packages will have five blocks of 50MW each and will comprise of twostage bids, technocommercial and price. \"Solar will form an  part of our energy mix,\"  an NTPC executive who also didn\\'t want to be identified. As part of its strategy, India has rolled out an ambitious campaign to promote solar energy through organizations under the ministries of defence and home such as the India Army, and central public sector units (CPSUs) such as India Railways, NTPC, NHPC Ltd and Coal India Ltd, providing them with grants on the condition that they source equipment from domestic manufacturers. According to the plan, reviewed by Mint, the government will provide financial support of up to Rs.1 crore per MW to the implementing agency for setting up large solar capacities by placing orders with domestic manufacturers. It requires an investment of around Rs.8 crore per MW for setting up solar photovoltaic power projects. This comes in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Make in India programme, aimed at attracting foreign investments and turning India into a manufacturing hub. In its dispute notification, the US has charged India with imposing national content requirements and denial of national treatment for solar cells and solar modules. While the US has also complained that India provides subsidies to its domestic producers involved in the manufacture of solar cells and solar modules; the India government has termed the scheme WTOcompliant. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of NTPC and India ministry of new and renewable energy remained unanswered till press time. NTPC, which has a 17% share in the country electricity generation mix, with an installed power generation capacity of 43,128 MW, plans to generate 3,300 MW from solar energy. The utility plans to add 14,038 MW during the 12th Plan period (201217) and has budgeted an ambitious capital expenditure target of Rs.1.5 trillion. It has set itself the target of becoming a 128,000 MW power producer by 2032. India and the US on Sunday agreed to work closely on efforts to promote solar energy. \"We very much support India ambitious goal for solar energy and stand ready to speed this expansion with additional financing,\" Obama  after his meeting with Modi in the national capital on Sunday. Mint reported on 24 January about the US statement of support which may help it attract more investment to fund projects to produce solar and wind power. India has substantially revised an earlier solar energy target of achieving 20,000 MW of capacity by 2022 to 100,000 MW. It plans to put in place 60,000 MW of wind power capacity by then. Both targets would require around Rs.10 trillion of investment if they are to be met. \"Prime Minister Modi emphasized India ongoing efforts to create a market environment that will promote trade and investment in this sector. President Obama welcomed India ambitious solar energy goals and encouraged India to continue its efforts to increase trade and private investment in this sector. President Obama conveyed the potential availability of US government official financing in this area, consistent with its policies, to support private sector involvement for those entities in contributing to India clean energy requirements,\" the joint statement . There has been growing interest from US firms to set up manufacturing facilities in India. USbased SunEdison Inc. announced this month that it plans to build a solar photovoltaic manufacturing facility in India in a joint venture with Adani Enterprises Ltd with an investment of around $4 billion. Also, First Solar Inc., which builds large solar farms, mainly for utilities, is exploring an opportunity to set up manufacturing operations in India. India National Action Plan on Climate Change recommends that the country generate 10% of its power from solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources by 2015, and 15% by 2020. Of India installed power generation capacity of 255,012.79 MW, renewable power has a share of only 12.42%, or 31,692.14 MW.',\n",

At issue is a 15 old fight over an antidumping (AD) case that the U.S. industry says has effectively halted U.S. exports to that country. In response to a question from Sen. Johnny Isakson (RGA), Froman  South African Trade Minister Rob Davies \"a few days ago\" handed him an offer from the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) to its U.S. counterpart for a potential settlement, but that he has not yet received a reaction from the from the U.S. industry. He  he met Davies in Switzerland, an apparent reference to the Davos World Economic Forum that Froman and Davies attended. USA Poultry & Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) President Jim Sumner acknowledged that the organization is reviewing a proposal from SAPA it received late last week in order to offer a response. \"We\\'re glad to have received their proposal and we look at it as a starting point,\" Sumner .

In December, Sumner  that the U.S. industry is looking for the ability to ship \"an acceptable volume\" of U.S. bonein chicken parts to South Africa without antidumping duties (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 19). >On Jan. 29, Isakson and Sen. Chris Coons (DDE) are slated to send a letter to Froman, which Isakson  at the Finance hearing would reinforce their position that Froman should \"use the opportunity of AGOA and the leverage that it brings with the South Africans to be sure that we break through the impasse regarding poultry.\" Coons and Isakson are cochairs of the Senate Chicken Caucus. Coons sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Isakson sits on the Finance trade subcommittee. Both threatened South African President Jacob Zuma in a letter last  that his country could lose its AGOA benefits if the poultry issue is not resolved \"expeditiously\" in a way that guarantees market access for U.S. poultry there',\n",

After signing the deal with Ukrainian Finance Minister Natalia Yaresko, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticised what he called \"Russian aggression\", a reference to Moscow support for separatists battling Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine which has triggered the Western sanctions on Moscow. \"We remain prepared to do more (on sanctions) if necessary. To that end, we will continue to work with our allies to increase the pressure on Russia,\" Lew told reporters at the signing ceremony. Lew added that the sanctions could be eased if Russia abided by the terms of the Minsk agreements signed last September which called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian fighters and military equipment from Ukraine. Moscow denies Western and Ukrainian accusations that it has sent regular forces into eastern Ukraine. Like other major donors to Ukraine, Lew  the U.S. deal was contingent on the exSoviet republic continuing with fiscal and anticorruption reforms and remaining on track to meet the conditions of its loan programme with the International Monetary Fund. In addition to the $2 billion in loan guarantees offered so far, President Barack Obama will ask the U.S. Congress on Monday to authorize another billion dollars in support for Ukraine, Lew told the BBC in an interview. IMF officials are now in Kiev negotiating a bailout package, currently worth $17 billion, which Ukraine proWestern government hopes will be expanded to help it handle crippling external debt repayments due this . Ukraine military on Wednesday reported the deaths of three more Ukrainian soldiers in the past 24 hours, adding to a steadily mounting death toll in a conflict in which more than 5,000 people have been killed since last April.

       " \"WTO Chief: Advancing Doha Talks in 2015 Will Be ‘Incredibly Difficult,’ Not Impossible By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, January 30, 2015 Jan. 29 — World Trade Organization members maintained the intractable positions that have stymied the Doha Round despite a notable shift toward engagement, WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo . “While substantive positions haven't changed a great deal since last time these issues were discussed, it is clear to me that the tone of the discussion has changed,” Azevedo told members at a Jan. 29 informal Heads of Delegation meeting in Geneva. The meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, reviewed members' discussions in several panels held throughout the week, including at a Jan. 24 “MiniMinisterial” trade meeting in Davos, Switzerland; an informal Committee on Trade and Development meeting on Jan. 26; and a pair of Jan. 28 WTO Agriculture Committee meetings in Geneva. Thursday meeting marked the second of the socalled “Room W” Heads of Delegation meetings that will be held between now and the July 31 deadline set by members to produce a highly developed and precise work program. Azevedo did not announce the date of the next meeting. Engagement on Substance Advancing a detailed, modalitiesfocused work program to resolve the remaining issues of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement “is still going to be incredibly difficult but I never thought it would be impossible,” Azevedo told meeting attendees. Azevedo  the “big increase in the political will” he heard in his meetings with highlevel trade ministers in Davos already has provided a “clarity which we didn't have before.” “Members have started to go into more detail and to engage on the substance,” he . “In addition, we have heard people express a willingness to entertain new thinking in certain areas.” Members considered a new proposal aimed at narrowing the differences over tradedistorting agricultural subsidy rules during the Jan. 28 Agriculture Committee meeting (19 WTO, 1/29/15). They were unable to break new ground in the debate over market access rules and public stockholding proposals. Plurilaterals Looming Azevedo did not say what will happen if members fail to meet the July 31 deadline for a postBali work program. Although members have six months to address the historically challenging issues of agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and service rules, their inability to strike early compromises indicates a low level of ambition. Concurrently, the U.S. is negotiating broad free trade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that could supplement many of the WTO multilateral goals. The conclusion of these deals may accelerate if Congress grants President Barack Obama increased trade promotion authority via legislation.\",\n",

China offered several improvements in its latest attempt to join the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), but current members—including the U.S. and the European Union—have  the offer does not go far enough (03 WTO, 1/6/15). China agreed to lower from its previous offer the thresholds at which GPA levels would apply to procurement contracts. China did not, however, expand its list of stateowned enterprises that would be subject to GPA rules sufficient to appease current members. China agreed in 2001 to accede to the GPA, which sets out rules guaranteeing fair conditions of international competition for government procurement contracts and prohibiting discriminatory treatment between local and foreign suppliers as well as between foreign suppliers from different countries. Expanding Membership The goal of the GPA is to open up government procurement deals to international trade and competition, while ensuring transparency and a commitment to good governance. Last  members revised the GPA to modernize certain aspects of its rules and to expand its scope. The GPA is a “plurilateral” agreement, meaning that the market access concessions are only granted to suppliers in those countries that have acceded to the agreement.

Malmström urged China to “engage closely” with the EU and the other WTO information technology agreement (ITA) members to finalise a revised agreement, following the breakthrough with the ChinaUS agreement of November 2014. She , too, that she was “very pleased” to be working with China in the negotiations on the liberalisation of the trade in environmental goods and services (“green goods initiative”), launched at the start of 2014. The EU and China “have competitive industries in sectors like renewable energy, environmental equipment and resourceefficient technologies. An ambitious agreement that eliminates tariffs, as well as addressing nontariff barriers and services, will create economic and environmental benefits for both our societies and for the world as a whole”, she argued. The commissioner  she was looking for more from China in that country negotiations on joining the WTO government procurement agreement (GPA). “Clearer, more open procurement rules would help modernise China economy and improve governance overall … and would help tackle corruption. The EU is happy that China has now made a new offer but we still have some way to go yet”, she stressed. The commissioner restated the EU support for China application to join the talks on an international agreement on services (TiSA) but highlighted that the “challenge” is now for China to demonstrate its “commitment to the other major players”. She welcomed the cooperation between the EU and China on the new international guidelines on export credits, seeking to ensure they are “based on clear rules to make sure they don't distort competition and result in a race to the bottom”.

       " 'Davos Ministerial Shows Few Position Changes On PostBali Work Program Inside U.S. Trade 01/30/2015 An informal ministerial on the margins of the World Economic Forum produced few political signals from the 21 attendees that they were ready to make major changes to their approach on developing a postBali work program aimed at advancing the stalled Doha round, despite a strong plea from World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo to do so. For example, at the Jan. 24 meeting, there were no clear indications that countries were ready to drop their linkages between progress on agriculture and nonagricultural market access (NAMA), or to bury their differences over the extent to which the 2008 modalities texts for agriculture and NAMA will need to be changed for a postBali work program. Brazil repeated its longstanding position that it needs clarity on what can be achieved on agriculture in order to determine what it can do in the other core negotiating areas, one Geneva source . Another Geneva source  Brazil emphasized that agriculture has to be a priority in the work program and that the level of ambition there will determine the outcome of other areas. In contrast, the European Union has taken the position that all three core areas must move forward in parallel and that there must be balance between the obligations on these areas as well as within each area. For example, in advance of Davos, European Union Ambassador Angelos Pangratis told a Jan. 21 informal heads of delegation meeting that an ambitious outcome in agriculture will only be possible with an equivalent effort on NAMA. \"[A]nd focusing on agriculture, it will be difficult to envisage an outcome in market access if export competition and domestic support do not follow,\" he . Within export competition, Pangratis signaled that export credit issues should be addressed if agricultural export subsidies are to be reduced. \"We cannot have a situation where certain types of [export competition] subsidies are prohibited, while others continue to thrive,\" he . At the meeting in Davos, Azevedo urged ministers to \"recalibrate\" their positions on the 2008 modalities, arguing that could mean being more ambitious in some areas and less ambitious in others, he  at a Jan. 24 press conference. But one Geneva source  recalibrating is really a euphemism for scaling back the goals. That source also  that there was a general agreement in Davos that ambitions would have to be lowered if members are to agree to a work program by July 31. However, New Zealand warned that ambitions should not be lowered to the point that an agreement becomes meaningless, the source . Azevedo urged ministers to move past their current debate on the future of the 2008 proposals for modalities, which he  involved a \"lot of fingerpointing.\" \"We are going to now look at the world and reassess\" these texts, he . At the meeting, ministers agreed to discuss their differences on the 2008 modalities in response to Azevedo request for a new look at the 2008 texts, according to a Geneva source. Pangratis gave some indication at the Jan. 21 meeting in Geneva that the EU would like to take a \"simpler, more realistic\" approach than the 2008 texts on agricultural and NAMA tariffs. He  such an approach should allow members flexibility to cater to their sensitivities and suggested that it could involve \"some use\" of average tariff cuts. But one source warned that average tariff cuts could allow countries to protect tariff peaks for sensitive products by cutting tariffs on less sensitive products. That effect could be tempered if those cuts were coupled with the obligation to make a certain minimum cut to all tariff lines. This source  nobody has rejected the use of averages as a possible approach, but emphasized that the discussion has been focused on concepts only. No country has introduced a specific proposal, he . The source  such a proposal would be necessary in the near future if the July deadline for a work program is to be met. The source  that as many as 10,000 tariff lines would need to be examined and that is a timeintensive process. He also  that South Africa and Argentina prefer a requestoffer approach to the 2008 modalities on NAMA and that countries need to reassess that approach as well. The U.S. has long held the view that the 2008 modalities on agriculture no longer reflect trade realities and impose too few obligations on emerging markets and does not produce enough market access. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman testified to the Senate Finance committee this week that multilateral subsidies rules on agriculture must reflect that China and India have emerged as major subsidizers. This message was also part of his Jan. 22 posting on the USTR Geneva mission website. A Geneva source  agricultural subsidies was the most contentious issue during the 2008 negotiations, and is likely to remain so. The 2008 approach on NAMA was based on the \"Swiss formula\" aimed at reducing tariff peaks. These modalities assigned developed countries one coefficient to calculate tariff reductions while allowing developing countries to choose from three different coefficients based on how many tariff lines they wish to protect. The 2008 modalities did not apply the Swiss formula to least developed countries (LDCs) and those countries are seeking reassurances in the current negotiations that they would not have to take on any additional tariff cuts, the source . These countries do not want the U.S. demands that China and India take on more obligations to affect their tariff flexibilities, according to the source. Azevedo also urged ministers to give their ambassadors more flexibility in Geneva to not only make demands, but to indicate what concessions they are willing to make. \"I asked [the ministers] to instruct their ambassadors in Geneva to stop speaking in general terms and to engage in the specifics and I urged them to give their ambassadors the green light to take risks and to put their cards on the table,\" he  at the Jan. 24 press briefing. \"We need to understand that it is not enough to say what you want, you also have to say what you\\'re ready to give,\" Azevedo . A Geneva source added that as part of this exercise, countries have to drop their maximal demands and be clearer about their real red lines. Azevedo did not describe the response he received other than to say that the new approach is \"beginning to sink in.\" He  that the \"spirit of urgency is there, but also a spirit of realism.\" According to Azevedo, \"ministers realize that we are again at a critical junction and we have to deliver results if the multilateral system is to prosper.\" The deadline for a postBali work program was delayed seven months in November 2014 as part of the deal to implement the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The original deadline was midDecember, but was pushed back after members were unable to meet the original TFA implementation deadline of July 31, 2014 and spent the next five months working to do so.',\n",

Only India companies will be allowed to bid for the projects, which will have a combined 750 megawatts (MW) capacity, a spokeswoman for NTPC  on Thursday. The spokeswoman declined to say why foreign companies were not able to bid, and stressed that India subsidiaries of foreign manufacturers would be free to participate in its future solar projects. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ambitious plans for solar won the support of President Barack Obama last weekend, with the U.S. leader offering to help finance an expansion of solar energy during a visit to New Delhi. Modi wants foreign companies to lead $100 billion of fresh investment to raise India solar energy capacity 33 times to 100,000 MW by 2022, providing big opportunities for U.S. companies like First Solar and SunEdison.

       " 'At DSB, India Appeals Poultry Ruling, \\'Havana Club\\' Gains New Impetus Inside U.S. Trade 01/30/2015 India this week appealed a World Trade Organization panel decision from last fall that faulted New Delhi for imposing import restrictions on certain agricultural products from the United States due to an outbreak of lowpathogenic avian influenza virus in parts of the U.S. The appeal was made during a meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) on Jan. 26, which was the deadline for India to file its appeal in the case. The U.S. and India in November agreed to push back the deadline by more than a month until that date, in an effort to ease the workload on the Appellate Body. India move was announced in a WTO press release, but the formal notice of appeal detailing India claims had not been released as of press time. Its arguments, however, are almost sure to take on the panel finding that India had failed to recognize the concept of \"diseasefree areas and areas of low disease prevalence,\" and therefore violated Article 6.2 of the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (Inside U.S. Trade, Oct. 17, 2014). The U.S. won on almost all claims, and there was no indication that the U.S. had crossappealed. The longstanding \"Havana Club\" rum dispute between the U.S. and European Union also gained new life at the DSB meeting in the wake of President Obama announcement of a shift in U.S. Cuba policy. Cuba criticized the U.S. as being noncompliant with the 2002 Appellate Body ruling in favor of the EU. Some of the 20 members that spoke in support of Cuba  they hoped the announcement that U.S. would restore diplomatic relations with Havana would restore would lead to a resolution of the case, but the U.S. rebuffed that idea, saying that the DSB was not the appropriate forum to have discussions on diplomatic relations. The fight stems from a 2002 Appellate Body that faulted a U.S. law allowing Bacardi USA to use the \"Havana Club\" rum brand, despite the brand already being marketed by Francebased Pernod Ricard, which licenses the Cuban trademark. In its statement to the DSB, the U.S. also complained that China has maintained a ban on foreign suppliers of electronic payment services by requiring them to have a license without providing any procedures to obtain one. The U.S. also raised issue with the EU refusal to approve any new agricultural biotechnology products for import in 2014, claiming that the lack of approvals is \"seriously disrupting trade in agricultural products between the United States and EU.\" Several U.S. lawmakers raised that same issue with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman at a Jan. 27 Senate Finance hearing on U.S. trade policy (see related story). Also at the DSB meeting, the body adopted an Appellate Body ruling that upheld a panel ruling that faulted two Argentine import policies as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Buenos Aires continued to express dismay over the result of the case, reiterating previous arguments that the complainants were unable to properly identify an \"overarching measure\" that can be challenged in the WTO. \"Argentina regrets that the three complainants may have advanced through all stages of the case without having to identify properly and accurately the specific normative content of the alleged overarching measure as a different measure from its specific components,\" it  at the meeting. The Argentinian measures were challenged by the United States, European and Japan. Australia, Canada and Taiwan were third parties in the case.',\n",
       " 'Solar cloud over IndiaUS ties M Ramesh 30 January 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) WTO panel to hear US complaint on Feb 3 The solar dispute hovers like a cloud over the growing friendship between India and the US. Observers in India are watching what the US will do between now and February 3, when a WTO dispute panel will hear the US complaint. The US feels that India’s ‘domestic content requirement’ (DCR) under the the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) violates WTO rules. The DCR provision requires some solar power projects to be set up using only Indiamade photovoltaic cells and modules. (Solar modules are made with cells produced from polysilicon.) Antidumping duties In August, the India government refrained from imposing antidumping duties on solar cells and modules imported from a few countries including the US. The anticipation, therefore, is that the US will reciprocate by dropping its complaint with the WTO against the DCR provision. Recently, JNNSM bid out projects worth 750 MW — solar companies had to bid for ‘viability gap funding’ given by the Centre. Half of that capacity was mandated to be under DCR. Industry observers believe that the India government has provided sufficient grounds for the US to withdraw its complaint. First, the government has since raised the solar capacity target to 100,000 MW to be achieved by 2022, up from 20,000 MW earlier. As such, part of the capacity to be created with domestic modules will be too small to affect business opportunities for American companies. Second, India is getting governmentowned, companies such as NTPC to set up solar power projects with domestic modules. For starters, public sector undertakings will set up 1,000 MW of projects and Defence establishments another 300 MW. This, the government hopes, will be treated as ‘government procurement’ — WTO rules allow local product preference under ‘government procurement’. Subsidy issue “The market is large and American companies may not be too keen on lobbying against India,” says Jasmeet Khurana, an analyst at BridgetoIndia, an Indiacentric solar consultancy. Khurana feels that, in any case, the government intends to abolish subsidies for solar beyond 2017, and if there is no subsidy there can be no DCR. As such, the buyIndia mandate is also for a short period, for a small slice of the market. “The US has been talking so much about clean energy. I hope they allow India to develop its solar industry,” a senior official of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy told BusinessLine on Thursday.',\n",
       " \"India, US disagree over food security Subhash Narayan 29 January 2015 Financial Chronicle After the brouhaha comes the crash. Days after the highpitched bonhomie on evidence during President Barack Obama’s threeday visit here, differences between India and US now threaten to derail the consensus on stock holding of food grains procured at below market price. The differences came starkly to fore at the first informal meeting of key WTO members held in Geneva on Thursday as the multilateral trade body made efforts to find a permanent solution to the issue of holding food stocks, procurement price and benchmark price on which the subsidy was computed. Interestingly enough, India rallied with China and other developing countries as part of G33 while USled grouping had Australia and European Union. This vertical split on food stocks and subsidies has cast fresh doubts on the perceived improvement in bilateral relations between US and India best showcased during President Obama’s visit this week to India. During prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the USA last September, a temporary truce had been achieved at a oneonone meeting with President Obama. On Thursday, G33 countries led by India wanted public stockholding for food security purposes to be brought under the “Green Box”, a euphemism for nontrade distorting domestic support for agriculture. “There could be some minor problems in negotiating long term solutions but the peace clause gives enough comfort room to India,” former member Planning Commission Anwarul Hoda . Under current WTO rules, developing countries are subject to only minimum disciplines on farm subsidies. Other countries like US, EU and Australia have taken the position that procurement made for food security purposes was by definition “market distorting”. News agencies quoted US officials as saying that “members cannot create a loophole in discipline” and were disappointed on the G33 move. USled advanced countries’ lobby also claimed that the G33 proposal to include subsidy, procurement price, stock limits has been rejected. But, the developing countries block led by India has maintained that its proposal was never rejected. The EU has maintained that there were “legitimate concerns” on both food security and trade distortions. The G33 proposal mooted that acquisition of food grain stocks by developing nations to support lowincome producers should not be bracketed with aggregate measurement of support (AMS) denoting trade distorting domestic support. Developing countries also expressed serious concern on calculations made under AMS, the difference between procurement price and the external reference price that determines subsidy to the farmer. The external reference price was still being kept at 198688 levels, a position not acceptable to developing countries. India’s position had caused a furore among developed nations last  when it blocked the trade facilitation agreement unless issues related to its food security programme was accepted under WTO rules. The logjam was broken by an interim peace clause in November 2014 that legally protected existing stockholding programmes of developing countries if purchases at governmentset prices take the countries' above the limits they have agreed for tradedistorting domestic support.\",\n",

The Asian powerhouse was targeted by 22 countries and regions with 97 trade probes, including 61 antidumping cases and 14 antisubsidy investigations, commerce ministry spokesman Shen Danyang . \"To a certain extent, the intense trade friction is a byproduct of China becoming the world biggest trading country in goods and secondlargest economy,\" he told reporters at a briefing. He also put it down to governments strengthening protection of their own domestic industries at a time when the world economy is lacking momentum. The number of trade investigations targeting Chinese products was expected to \"continue to be high\" this  as manufacturers become ever more competitive, he added.

       " 'Froman Holds Open Possible WTO Challenge To China Cotton Subsidies Inside U.S. Trade 01/30/2015 U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman this week held open the possibility the United States could challenge Chinese cotton subsidies at the World Trade Organization, though he emphasized he has been largely looking at this issue in the context of creating new multilateral subsidies disciplines. \"We\\'re looking at all our options [on China cotton subsidies],\" he told the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 27. \"We have not yet determined whether there is a case to be brought in this area.\" Froman  he has been engaging with China on cotton subsidies so as to get new disciplines on agricultural subsidies at the WTO. \"We\\'re hoping to engage with China on this and create some disciplines around this,\" he . Froman responded to a question from Sen. Johnny Isakson (RGA) on what can be done to rein in China market distorting actions. Isakson charged China is subsidizing its cotton producers at twice the world market price and stockpiling cotton, which is suppressing the cotton market. Froman noted that, over the past 10 to 15 , the pattern of agricultural subsidies has changed significantly. When the Doha round started in 2001, the U.S. and European Union were the major subsidizers. Since then, China and India have increased their agricultural subsidies while the U.S. and EU have reduced theirs, he . \"I think it  that we update our view where subsidies are coming from and what impact that has,\" he . The U.S. has revamped its cotton subsidies program in the last farm bill in response to a successful WTO challenge from Brazil. Froman  China, by some counts, could be considered the largest cotton subsidizer in the world. The National Cotton Council has charged that China has been paying subsidies to its cotton farmers at levels exceeding its WTO limits at least since 2011 (Inside U.S. Trade, Oct. 3, 2014). In the context of the efforts to find a way forward for the Doha agenda, the U.S. has refused to accept the 2008 agriculture modalities text as the basis for the postBali work program, partially because it imposes too few disciplines on emerging markets like China (see related story).',\n",
       " 'EU fails to agree new Russia sanctions By Christian Oliver in Brussels and Stefan Wagstyl in Berlin Financial Times Last updated:January 29, 2015 7:28 pm Increasingly divided EU ministers failed to issue a specific threat of further economic sanctions against Russia on Thursday, despite fears that the conflict in Ukraine was entering a dangerous new phase. European foreign ministers held an emergency meeting in Brussels to determine how to respond to the collapse of a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, fearing that this weekend’s bombardment of the port city of Mariupol marked a dramatic escalation of the fighting. However, diplomats in Brussels  it was increasingly difficult to preserve a united front among the 28 members of the EU, partly because of the recent election of a leftwing government in Greece which has vowed to act as a bridge between Europe and Russia. In a weak final statement, the ministers simply instructed the European Commission to undertake more preparatory work on loosely defined “appropriate action”. No deadline was given for this work to be completed. Earlier in the day, some nations had pushed for a more specific threat of “restrictive measures” against Russia — diplomatic code for sanctions. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign affairs chief,  European leaders would have a final say on how to interpret “appropriate action” against Moscow at a summit on February 12. The difficulty in issuing a clear threat to Russia highlights the EU’s faultlines. Arriving at the meeting, Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister,  Athens would work to prevent a “rift between the European Union and Russia”. His government, which came to power this week, had already expressed a “general reservation” towards EU measures aimed at expanding sanctions against Moscow. Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s foreign minister, slammed this weekend’s attack on Mariupol by proRussian rebels as “terrorism” that merited a direct response by the EU, such as more financial restrictions on Russia. “How many people should be killed before we say ‘je suis Ukrainien’?” he asked, in reference to the “Je suis Charlie” placards that became common after this month’s terrorist killings at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in Paris. EU sanctions imposed last  have targeted Russia’s energy, defence and banking sectors and have been seen as a critical factor in crippling Moscow’s economy, which has been weakened further by the collapsing oil price. Hawkish countries in the EU want more curbs on Russia’s access to international capital markets. Countries such as Britain, Sweden, Poland, Romania and the Baltic states also want a more specific timeframe for the imposition of new economic sanctions. However, diplomats from this hardline camp  France, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Germany were guarded about a tough response to Russia. Speaking before Thursday’s meeting, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s economy minister,  it was too early “at the present time” to speak about further sanctions. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister,  he understood the difficulty for some countries but that the EU needed to show it was willing to defend the rule of law. “At the end of the day, this is not just about Donbass itself or Ukraine\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we need to have mechanisms to respect the rules,” he . In a largely symbolic move, the EU ministers agreed to prolong until September the blacklisting of Russians and Ukrainians seen as instigating the conflict. Asset freezes and travel bans against them had been due to expire in March. Diplomats argue that the internal EU friction will make it far harder to renew the broader sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy when they expire in July.Business',\n",
       " 'House votes to speed reviews of natural gas export proposals Jennifer A. Dlouhy 29 January 2015 Houston Chronicle WASHINGTON The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed legislation to accelerate natural gas exports, despite muted opposition from the Obama administration and even as the Senate rejected a more aggressive plan. The bill, passed 277133, would force the Energy Department to decide whether to grant licenses to pending projects to broadly export liquefied natural gas within 30 days after they clear an environmental review. Under the Energy Department current practice, there is no deadline for those decisions. Officials wait until environmental reviews are done before taking up applications to export LNG to countries that aren\\'t U.S. free trade partners. For onshore LNG export projects, the environmental reviews typically happen as the ventures are under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission scrutiny. It can still take months after those environmental analyses are done and even after a FERC approval for the Energy Department to deliver a verdict on a project export license. Rep. Bill Johnson, ROhio, who sponsored the Housepassed bill,  that too long. The answer, he , is legislation \"cutting through the bureaucratic red tape.\" \"With dozens of projects seeking approval, Washington is making it difficult for businesses to make the investment decisions needed to take advantage\" of abundant natural gas, Johnson . Rep. Gene Green, DHouston, also  the current process \"is taking far too long.\" The White House did not issue a formal \"statement of administrative policy\" registering its views on the House bill. But administration officials have been wary of changes. \"The Department of Energy has already taken steps to modernize the LNG export approval process and ensure applications are looked at efficiently and expeditiously,\"  White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz. \"We believe the process is working well, and that bill is totally unnecessary.\" Similar moves are afoot in the Senate, with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee set to hold a hearing examining a nearly identical bill from Sen. John Barrasso, RWyo. But on Wednesday, the Senate voted 5345 to reject a much broader proposal that would have put LNG exports to World Trade Organization member nations on the same legal footing as those destined for countries that have free trade agreements with the U.S. Current law requires the Energy Department to grant approval for gas exports to those free trade partners without modification or delay. Sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, RTexas, the WTO measure was being considered as an amendment to legislation that would authorize the Keystone XL pipeline. Although his proposal won a majority of votes, it fell short of the 60 needed for adoption under a Senate agreement.',\n",

The demands, hours before Obama address to a House Democratic retreat, are part of a renewed focus by the party on middleclass economic issues. Republicans have made free trade a top priority and have called on Obama to bring Democrats into line. Obama last week proposed shifting tax breaks from the wealthy to the middle class. He also asked Congress to give him \"fasttrack\" authority to negotiate trade agreements, something many Democrats oppose, fearing American workers would lose more ground. \"Show me a trade deal that not only increases GDP (gross domestic product), but increases the average worker monthly paycheck and I\\'ll be for it,\" Representative Steve Israel told reporters. \"That the message. We\\'re open to a trade deal, but it got to increase median household income and not just GDP. And if the administration can get us there, it will pass with Democratic votes.\" Virginia Gerry Connolly, a leader of the protrade New Democrats, sees no more than 50 Democratic votes and other protrade Democrats see 2540 votes. Representative Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee,  each trade deal will need to demonstrate stronger paychecks and wages for American workers, but it will be difficult to evaluate the 12nation TransPacific Partnership (TPP) agreement now being negotiated. Israel, who headed House Democratic campaign efforts during November elections that ceded Senate control and more House seats to Republicans, now has a senior role shaping the Democratic Party message. He  many middle class workers felt cheated by manufacturing job losses after the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, and worry the U.S. economy could slip back into recession. Illustrating the resistance within the party, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and three colleagues are circulating an online petition against fasttrack. Obama, in a questionandanswer session with the lawmakers on Thursday, acknowledged that previous U.S. trade deals had not been perfect, according to a source in the room. Obama also pledged to work with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to ensure lawmakers had more information about the substance of the deals as they come together.

The FTAAP, which will contain all of the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation 21 member economies, is the most extensive plan for AsiaPacific economic integration to date, far exceeding the membership of two other regional blocs also in the works: the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The USled TPP, which includes Japan and 10 other Apec countries but excludes China, seeks to eliminate tariffs and is aimed as the biggest freetrade agreement for the US. The 16member RCEP comprising the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and six states with which Asean has freetrade agreements, including China is more focused on market access. \"FTAAP could render TPP and RCEP unnecessary in the long run, but it quite a long run,\" Bollard . \"FTAAP could also render Apec unnecessary, and if that happens, that for the good.\" But he emphasised it is still a distant scenario as Apec 21 members have only just agreed to begin a \"strategic study\" of the FTAAP a prerequisite for actual negotiations in a breakthrough achieved at the Apec meeting in Beijing in November,  after the idea was first mooted. \"We are thinking most probably it 2020s [that the FTAAP could be realised],\" Bollard . China has been pushing for FTAAP to preempt the US from reasserting its leadership as a Pacific power through TPP. Negotiations for TPP started in 2005 but have dragged on because of the difficulties of getting all the members to agree on the thorny issues of intellectual property, labour and environmental standards, and also because of differences within the American political dispensation. \"We are hearing there is a US political window of opportunity over the next couple of months, where there might be an agreement between Congress and the president on fasttrack authority,\" Bollard . President Barack Obama, who is seeking trade promotion authority from his own Democratic Party as well as the Republicans, last week  in his State of the Union address to Congress that the US, not China, should be writing world trade rules. \"I think he just saying to his countrymen that they\\'ve got a chance to set the standard with TPP that would be a new standard for regional and international trade agreements. That a visionary statement, [but] yet to be seen whether achievable,\" Bollard . No one country should be writing world trade rules, he . \"The WTO should write the rules. \"The only way these trade agreements could be signed is by consensus ??The FTAAP should be looking at the best rules wherever we can find them.\" The TPP might be forged earlier than the RCEP, Bollard , although expectations on both might have to be lowered to achieve consensus. \"At the moment, chief negotiators for TPP are meeting in New York and the hope is that they might get something that is pretty close to being able to go to the ministers for signoff, [but even] then it will still be pretty long term before anything practical happens as all 12 member states will need to ratify it,\" he . \"RCEP is going to take longer.

The United States has long been the world leader in attracting FDI, traditionally made up mainly of crossborder mergers and acquisitions and new corporate projects overseas, but last  its net inflows fell by twothirds to $86 billion, preliminary data published on Thursday shows. That was largely down to a deal between U.S. firm Verizon Communications Inc and its British partner Vodafone , which included a share buyback that reversed $130 billion of foreign investment out of the United States.

       " 'Oil’s fall pushes Germany into deflation Claire Jones in Frankfurt Financial Times Last updated:January 29, 2015 3:20 pm Germany has become the latest eurozone member state to slump into deflation, with the first fall in prices since the autumn of 2009, supporting the case for last week’s landmark quantitative easing package from the European Central Bank. Germany’s Federal Statistics Office  on Thursday it expected harmonised consumer prices, calculated to fit with the broader eurozone calculation, to decline 0.5 per cent in the  to January — a fall from a rise in costs of 0.1 per cent in the  to December. The plunge was almost entirely down to the collapse in oil prices, with energy costs falling 9 per cent over the 12 months. The last time prices fell in the eurozone’s largest economy was in September 2009 and the latest dip all but confirms that deflation across the currency area worsened in January. Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect figures to be released on Friday by Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics agency, to show prices fell 0.5 per cent in January. With German prices falling at a faster pace than expected, the eurozone figure could undershoot forecasts. “[The German inflation figure] means expectations for eurozone inflation now carry a decidedly downside risk,”  Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank. “The drop in oil prices suggests that eurozone headline inflation should stay below the zero line until autumn.” Prices dipped 0.2 per cent across the region in the  to December, falling in 12 out of 19 eurozone member states. Germany’s separate estimate of consumer prices (see chart) showed a drop of 0.3 per cent from the earlier month. The ECB, which targets inflation of below but close to 2 per cent, announced a €1.1tn quantitative easing package last Thursday to tackle the threat of a vicious bout of deflation. The ECB and the eurozone’s national central banks will buy €60bn worth of assets a month until September 2016 to counter a negative spiral of falling prices, weak credit and stagnant demand. Neither of the central bank’s German policy makers, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann and executive board member Sabine Lautenschläger, backed QE — a policy which has faced fierce criticism from the economic and political establishment within the currency area’s most powerful member state. While the German economy is strong enough to weather a spell of falling prices, deflation threatens to create havoc in weaker members of the currency area. The plunge in oil prices is likely to boost consumers’ spending on other goods and services in relatively strong economies such as Germany’s, where unemployment is at a postunification low. The danger for the eurozone is that in weaker parts of the region, deflation will lead consumers to delay purchases, weighing on already anaemic demand. Low wage inflation in the eurozone’s largest economy is, however, causing problems at the country’s central bank. Andreas Dombret, the Bundesbank board member responsible for banking and financial supervision, has complained to the German press that he is losing staff to the ECB because it pays its supervisors about twice as much for the same jobs. Mr Dombret told German daily Börsen Zeitung on Wednesday that it was a “challenge” for the Bundesbank, which is constrained by a German civil service settlement on pay, to retain employees. The ECB took over supervision of the eurozone’s largest lenders in November when its regulatory wing, the single supervisory mechanism, opened for business. The SSM intends to employ about 1,000 people. Mr Dombret  80 of the Bundesbank’s 1,300 supervisors had left for the ECB.',\n",

       " 'India, China, Indonesia want cap on foodgrain procurement removed 31 January 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) WTO kicks off dedicated session on public stockholding and food security. Maintaining its hard posture on food security at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), India has  that Government procurement of foodgrain at nonmarket prices should be allowed without limits. China, Indonesia and Turkey were some of the other members of the G33 alliance of developing countries in agriculture which pushed for exclusion of support prices for foodgrain from the list of tradedistorting subsidies. Difference of opinion The proposal, discussed in the first session on finding a permanent solution to Indias (as well as some other developing countries) problem of ensuring food security without bending global trade rules was, however, opposed by some such as the US, the EU, Pakistan, Australia, Japan, Argentina and Paraguay. While India and some other G33 members argued that unlimited Government food procurement was necessary to ensure food security to poor, those objecting  that without adequate disciplines it could lead to unintended consequences such as hurting the food security of other countries, a Government official told BusinessLine. WTO members are supposed to find a permanent solution by the end of this  as per the agreement reached in the Bali Ministerial meeting in December 2013, which was later renegotiated by India. New Delhi, meanwhile, has got a shortterm solution as part of the Bali deal where members have agreed not to take legal action against it in case subsidy cap is breached. Since the reprieve granted to India is subject to a number of conditions including sharing of numerous data and details, India wants a simple permanent solution to the problem as soon as possible. India and the G33 want that on account of public stockholding, whatever amounts of subsidy go beyond de minimis (the subsidy cap fixed at 10 per cent of total production), it should be excluded from the aggregate measurement of support (actionable subsidies), the official . The G33 proposal, made in 2012, also talks about alternative solutions which includes calculating procurement subsidies by changing the base  from 198688 and making it more recent, or by indexing it to inflation. We are flexible in our approach. We dont intend to just stick to one proposal, but are ready to discuss the alternatives suggested in G33s earlier proposal, the official . India runs the risk of breaching the agriculture subsidy cap, at least in rice, in a few  time once it fully implements its food security legislation. In Bali, it agreed to give its approval to an agreement on trade facilitation that places obligations on all members to upgrade their customs infrastructure only on the condition that the rules on food procurement subsidies are changed.',\n",

Our challenge is to cooperate to mutual advantage in the areas of high technology, science, health, education, energy, agriculture, trade, investment and so on, where the US can offer us much. At the same time, our strategic partnership should not become a point of pressure to support those US policies that are contrary to our interests, whether in West Asia, towards Iran and, now Russia, or on issues of climate change or World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. The success of our US policy will depend on how we can balance these two factors. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the initiative to give a decisive boost to IndiaUS relations by inviting President Barak Obama to Republic Day celebrations. The visit has been a great success for Modi, whose personal rapport with Obama has been evident from physical embraces and firstname familiarity. His demeanour has been that of a confident and selfassured leader dealing with the leader of the world foremost power as an equal. Beyond building his own personal stature by his style of engagement, Modi builds his country stature, too, as a rising India infused with a new dynamism. The breakthrough understandings reached on the liability issues and administrative arrangements for operationalizing the nuclear deal is the biggest takeaway from the visit. Whatever the nature of the compromise reached, Modi has done well to shift the issue from the government to the commercial arena. The larger issue of the technical and commercial viability of USsupplied nuclear plants remains. The defence cooperation framework agreement has been renewed for another 10 . Expectations of some significant announcements under the defence technology and trade initiative have been belied, as four pathfinder projects involving lowcomplexity technologies have been identified for in principle codevelopment and coproduction. The importance of this as the first step need not be minimized, but caution is the watch word, clearly. The joint statement speaks of making the USIndia partnership in the area of counterterrorism a defining relationship for the 21st century. This suggests an almost complete understanding of the challenges that both countries face and the strategies to tackle them. That the US has sanctioned three Dcompany affiliates is satisfying, but doubts remain whether the US would fully share actionable intelligence on terrorist threats to India from Pakistani soil because the logical thing then would be to ask the Pakistani side to neutralize such threats from the root. What is less satisfying is the exclusion of the Taliban from the list of entities to target, which suggests India and the US are not on the same page on this group and its links to Pakistan ambitions in Afghanistan at India cost. On trade, investment and intellectual property rights (IPR) issues, our engagement with the US will continue. The US wants a highstandard bilateral investment treaty, but this involves many policy, legal and regulatory issues. In a tentatively worded text, it has been agreed that the two sides will assess the prospects for moving forward. The hazy language on the totalization agreement offers little promise for us. On IPRs, negotiations will continue in 2015 under the highlevel working group. The higher education agenda finds only passing mention in the joint statement. Difficulties in accessing certain dualuse technology from the US have been noted. Nothing of substance has been  on the controversial Internet governance issue. On climate change, we have agreed to work together during the  to achieve a successful agreement at the UN conference in Paris. In the joint press conference, Modi denied the USChina agreement put any pressure on India, but accepted that all countries were under pressure for the sake of posterity. This clever line gives him freedom to calibrate his cooperation with the US, even as he steers the US towards greater participation in our solar energy programme. On hydrofluorocarbons, we seem to moving towards the US position. The separate document on the USIndia joint strategic vision for the AsiaPacific and India Ocean region is most significant geopolitically. We clearly intend to work closely with the US and other potential partners in the region, such as Japan and Australia, to counter China assertiveness in AsiaPacific, and, by extension, in the India Ocean. This is a big change from our past deference to Chinese sensitivities. This document amplifies the joint statement affirmation that India Act East policy and US rebalance towards Asia provide opportunities for both countries and other AsiaPacific countries to work closely to strengthen regional ties. On the whole, Obama visit has put IndiaUS relations on the fast track. Now, any derailing has to be avoided.',\n",
       " 'Obama cranks up trade pitch to Dems Politico 31 January 2015 President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and a phalanx of top administration officials are making the sales pitch to congressional Democrats for fasttrack authority on trade deals. Obama and Biden each made that plea during their appearances at this weeks House Democratic retreat in Philadelphia, which ended Friday. Top White House economic adviser Jeffrey Zients, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Labor Secretary Tom Perez have also joined the effort to sway House and Senate Democrats, as well as some skeptical Republicans. The administration hopes to secure the 30 to 50 Democratic yes votes in the House that might be needed to push a trade bill over the top. But sources have  the White House is still only informally counting votes, and Obama was careful to soften the hard sell during a closeddoor meeting with lawmakers here Thursday night. He  the White House will make [a] substantive case for a trade deal but wont go after folks or make the vote a litmus test for Democrats, according to sources in the room. We share same values and are looking out for the same people, Obama  in response to a question from Washington Rep. Derek Kilmer, who  he was still undecided despite his states dependence on trade. Obama also pledged to work with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) so that members have better access to the substance of the agreements, sources . Biden also gave a forceful pitch for trade during his closeddoor appearance at the retreat Friday. The legislation also has support from the New Democrat Coalition, an alliance of probusiness lawmakers. The group estimates that roughly 30 of its members will ultimately support the fasttrack measure, according to a private memo obtained by POLITICO. The coalition isnt creating a whip team to lobby onthefence Democrats, though the groups chairman, Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind,  hes been discussing the merits of trade oneonone. But a memo circulated by coalition staffers  the group has been urging freshman lawmakers to hold off on signing antitrade letters from Democratic Reps. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, two leading critics of the proposed deals. Working with the White House and business community, we were able to keep about half of the Dems (including 4 out of the 5 New Dems) to commit to stay off the letter and give the President a chance to make his case, the memo . The trade promotion authority legislation would expedite the passage of trade deals by letting Obama submit the final agreements to Congress for an upordown vote, without amendments. That authority is viewed as key to wrapping up two giant agreements the TransPacific Partnership with 11 AsiaPacific countries, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the 28 nations of the European Union because other nations would have the assurance that Congress wont undo any concessions included in the deals. The trade pacts have drawn opposition from liberal groups concerned about their effect on U.S. jobs and wages, labor rights, the environment and intellectual property protections. And House Democrats are deeply divided on giving Obama or any president authority to negotiate trade packages without letting Congress amend the terms. Any legislation from Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (RUtah), top committee Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, and House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (RWis.) will probably be unveiled in late February. The Finance Committee is expected to first. Hatch  Friday that the fasttrack legislation is the countrys most  tool to open markets. The U.S. needs to lead on trade, Hatch  in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute. We need to establish rules that hold other nations accountable for their unfair trade practices. And we need to tear down barriers that block our goods from foreign markets. We can only do that if we renew TPA and do so soon. Both opponents and supporters base much of their case on potential growth for the middle class an issue central to the House Democrats defacto messaging strategy. Supporters argue that the middle class cant expand without the economic growth that comes with free trade, while opponents say wages will drop and jobs go overseas if trade deals dont offer strong protections. Im not saying trade is the middleclass issue, but its one of the middleclass issues,  Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on Ways and Means. He added that members showed a lot of interest in fasttrack authority during the retreat, following months of discussions in Washington. This is now the main thing going on, he . The debate over trade started early during the retreat. AFLCIO President Richard Trumka railed against the proposals during his headline speech to members Wednesday, and lawmakers held an earlymorning panel with DeLauro on trade Thursday. [The trade proposals are] nothing but a license to continue the same failed trade policies that have emptied America of jobs, Trumka , according to sources in the room. Trade can raise working people up or it can drive us down. DeLauros closeddoor panel brought nearly 30 members to debate currency, labor and environmental concerns. A source  the bulk of the lawmakers who spoke expressed support for the administrations trade proposal. And lawmakers will be hearing more soon. Kind  Lew will head to the Capitol in coming weeks to brief members on trade, following the nearly two  of meetings theyve had with Pritzker, Perez and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. Some lawmakers have complained that the administrations outreach efforts have been superficial. Levin  administration officials have stopped congressional staff from taking notes on the trade proposals, and lawmakers have been barred from taking paperwork from briefings. Some members also criticized an administration email blast that went out after Obamas State of the Union address, saying it was too lowkey for such a controversial policy. I wanted to be sure you saw the latest from the White House both the State of the Union excerpt and the fact sheet on the importance of trade agreements to our global competitiveness and economic growth, an administration official wrote in the email, which was shared with POLITICO. The President sees these agreements as essential for the U.S. not China to set the rules of the road and lead the way by establishing strong environmental, workplace and labor standards. Kind  Democrats have to make the case that without a strong U.S. presence in the global trade markets, the world economy could turn toward nations like China. We only have one of three options, Kind . Continue the status quo; have a global trading world with a China rule; or us being at the head of the table. Thats all we got. He added that no country is willing to risk signing onto a trade deal that is subject to changes from 435 independent contractors, and that its in Democrats interest to keep Republicans from playing politics with Obamaforged deals. You can complain about TPA all you want, but if you allow a Republican Congress to amend and change youre going to end up in a worse position than what you started with, Kind . It doesnt make sense for a Democratic member to oppose it. But another Democratic lawmaker who is widely seen as probusiness  he hasnt been convinced either way on trade. The member  it is hard to stomach accepting trade deals that might benefit large corporations that oppose Democratic priorities. I try to keep an open mind, at least giving them a chance, the lawmaker . [Ive had] a few meetings at the White House, and labor has put a lot of pressure on folks, but the other part of it is, its tough when you have the Chamber of Commerce and these big companies who are perceived to be benefiting from it who wont even raise the minimum wage. The Democratic caucus antitrade leaders are searching for moderates to peel away from the White House. DeLauro approaches New Democrat Coalition members each day Congress is in session to ask where they stand and lobby against the deals, multiple members . DeLauro  the central argument against the deals is that giving U.S. employers easier access to cheap labor markets could drive down American wages. Speaking after her briefing during the retreat, DeLauro  the partys focus on middleclass economics for the 2016 elections will make it hard to sell lawmakers on accepting trade packages that could hurt U.S. workers. Congress can no longer give this administration or any future one the benefit of the doubt, especially given the scope of this particular deal, DeLauro  in a statement with Rep. Louise Slaughter (DN.Y.) earlier this week. Americas trade policy has not improved the lives of the middle class and leading economists overwhelmingly agree that trade has contributed to the rise in income inequality. House Democratic leaders say theyre keeping an opening mind but that lawmakers will pay close attention to how wage protections are included in any proposal. Pelosi  Friday that she is searching for a path to yes. I dont know if that possible, she . [But] I think people are open to listening because we are a party of trade and we understand the global economy. We will make a judgment based on what impact it has on wages. The antitrade caucus is bolstered by conservative Republicans who have no intention of handing Obama even more executive authority. Twentytwo Republicans previously signed a letter circulated by Rep. Walter Jones (RN.C.) that decried the fasttrack option as unconstitutional, and while some have since left Congress, the number of GOP lawmakers skeptical of White House overreach has grown. Many Republican lawmakers have  they first need to see the proposal from the Senate and House committees.',\n",
       " 'Trade talks are gaining momentum 30 January 2015 The Washington Post As the Obama administration pushes toward a major new trade agreement in Asia this spring, it is developing two unlikely allies: Chinese officials abroad, who are signaling that they want in, and Republicans in Congress, who appear willing to support what would be one of President Obama biggest successes. The TransPacific Partnership, or TPP, is down to its final haggling. This week, negotiators from 12 countries met in New York to resolve the remaining issues, which have been narrowed from more than 2,000. The toughest matters left, ironically, are agricultural disputes with Japan and dairy and poultry disagreements with Canada. U.S. negotiators hope they can close out the TPP deal by the summer and get it approved by Congress thanks to Republican votes promised by House Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.). Republicans like trade even more than they dislike Obama, evidently. It a jobs bill that doesn\\'t cost any money. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the market opening features of the TPP will boost U.S. exports by about $123 billion annually by 2025 and add 600,000 jobs. What fascinating is that China seems to be catching TPP fever as the trade negotiations accelerate. Four  ago, when the talks began, Beijing was dismissive. Chinese leaders argued that the recession showed that the United States wasn\\'t competent to lead the global economy, and that the TPP was just another scheme to encircle and contain the fastgrowing Chinese economy. You don\\'t hear that kind of carping now. Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang sounded supportive last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he : \"We need to act along the trend of our time, firmly advance free trade, resolutely reject protectionism, and actively expand regional economic cooperation.\" Chinese officials go further in private, recent conversations in Beijing and Washington. They have  that China wants to negotiate membership in the TPP and, indeed, would like to join in the process of setting its rules. The Chinese are more cautious in talking with U.S. trade officials, asking instead how the process might work. But the message is clear: China sees this train leaving the station and wants eventually to be onboard. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman is  to have cautioned the Chinese that it will take a while for their economy to match the openness that the TPP would require. But in the meantime, the United States and China are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty that frontloads some of the toughest TPP issues. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally decided last  to embrace the investment treaty. The two sides are bargaining now over the \"negative list\" of industries or products that would be excluded from the pact; everything else would be included a big jump for Beijing. The Chinese seem to realize that they have to live in a TPP world. Other Asian countries that stayed out of this round, such as South Korea and the Philippines, have signaled that they want in. As a trading nation, China either joins its neighbors or risks losing a share of the expanding global market. \"The current situation for China is unsustainable,\" argues retired Adm. Dennis Blair, a former director of national intelligence who now head of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA. He contends that unless China joins the U.S. Japan led TPP consensus, accepting rules that will limit theft of intellectual property, its trade relations \"will drop back to a conventional, transactional basis, without an overarching framework.\" The TPP demonstration effect isn\\'t lost on Europe, either. After dithering for much of last  about a similar agreement known in tradespeak as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, Europeans have held three negotiating meetings since November and will launch another round next week. For a battered Europe veering back toward recession, the trade agreement offers the potential for exportled growth, especially as the euro sinks against the dollar and European exports become cheaper in world markets. The transatlantic solidarity represented by the TTIP is more welcome now, too, as Europeans and Americans contemplate the reckless behavior of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The moment when Europeans seemed ready to walk away from TTIP because of a snit over National Security Agency surveillance seems long past. What driving these political economic realignments? Simply put, the U.S. economy is stronger than analysts expected a  ago, the Chinese and European economies are weaker and the Russian economy is much weaker. Even Republicans in Congress seem ready to let Obama harvest the fruits.',\n",
       " 'TPP talks: Japan ready to meet US halfway on beef and pork tariffs 30 January 2015 Nikkei Report Japan and the U.S. are inching closer to an agreement on import tariffs on U.S. agricultural products as part of the ongoing TransPacific Partnership free trade talks. An agreement between the two countries is crucial as failure to strike a deal among the member countries by spring could derail the entire process. Washington has been calling for an elimination of all tariffs. Japan has been trying to buy as much time as it can for lowering tariffs on agricultural products. In Japan, agricultural production has been declining in value over the  due in large part to an aging farming population and an increase in abandoned farmland. As such, concern has been growing over the impact on the domestic agricultural industry if Japan were to allow a flood of cheaper foreign imports in a short period of time. Given the concerns, the Japanese government wants to be able to lower its tariffs on key agricultural products, such as beef and pork, over 10 . The government hopes that will allow it to respond to domestic opposition and ease concerns among agricultural producers. The Japanese government is willing to make significant cuts to beef and pork. It is widely expected to cut the 38.5% tariff on U.S. beef to about 10% over time and lower the 482 yen ($4.04) per kilogram levy on cheap U.S. pork to under 100 yen. The U.S. National Pork Producers Council  \"significant progress has been made with respect to Japan market access offer on pork.\" Import influx concerns Japan and the U.S. will now shift their focus to conditions for safeguard measures that are designed to raise tariffs if imports increase sharply. Japan wants to make it easier to implement safeguard measures so that it can prevent a large influx of U.S. agricultural imports. However, the U.S. wants to raise the bar for applying safeguard measures in the hope of boosting its imports. For Japan, the biggest hurdle is its negotiations with the U.S. But to conclude the overall TPP free trade talks, Tokyo needs to speed up and wrap up negotiations with other TPP member nations as well. On Sunday, chief negotiators of the 12 TPP member countries met in New York to resolve pending issues. Japan TPP chief negotiator Koji Tsuruoka is holding bilateral talks with his counterparts, particularly those from Canada and New Zealand. Negotiations with these two countries have been moving rather slowly. On Wednesday, Hiroshi Oe, Japan acting chief negotiator in charge of tariff negotiations arrived in New York for talks with officials from TPP countries with which Japan is making slow progress. So far, Japan has more or less reached agreements on import tariffs with both Brunei and Singapore. Plywood and other timber products have been a contentious issue between Japan and Malaysia, but the two countries are expected to reach a deal soon. With Australia, Japan is waiting to see how Canberra is going to coordinate domestic opinions. Some progress has been made on negotiations with Mexico, Chile and Peru. Japan has concluded economic partnership agreements with these countries and so the government has been making smooth headway in TPP negotiations with them. More hurdles Japan has suffered a setback in talks with Vietnam, New Zealand and Canada. Even though its EPA with Vietnam is already in force, the two countries have yet to hammer out an agreement on rice and automobile import tariffs. However, a Japanese government official close to the negotiation  \"we will make a significant progress in this round.\" New Zealand has made a strong case about eliminating Japan import tariffs. The country is calling on Japan to open its market to cheese and other dairy products from New Zealand. Japan intends to apply lowertariff or taxfree status to such products, but the two countries have yet to resolve their differences. Dairy products have also been a sticking point in Japan negotiations with Canada. Canada has had delays in talks not just with Japan but with other TPP member nations. Observers are raising concerns over Canada possible withdrawal from TPP talks, which could threaten to derail the negotiation overall.',\n",
       " 'Japan mulls concession on rice in TPP negotiations 30 January 2015 Kyodo News Japan has offered to import more rice from the United States in response to strident calls from Washington to make a concession toward concluding Pacific Rim free trade talks, negotiation sources  Friday. During bilateral talks, Japan has proposed a plan to increase annual rice imports from the United States by some 50,000 tons as part of its quota for an emergency stockpile under the envisioned TransPacific Partnership initiative, the sources . Japan has sought to protect its key farm products rice, wheat, beef and pork, dairy and sugar as exceptions to the tariffabolishing TPP. As rice, the staple part of the Japanese diet, is especially regarded as offlimits, agricultural lobbyists and lawmakers with close ties to farmers could react sharply against Tokyo plan. Japan and the United States have been at odds over the issue of market access for farm products and autos, which have held up the broad 12country negotiations. But trade officials from both sides recently  gaps are narrowing. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has expressed hope to conclude a deal in a \"small number of months.\" Japan currently imposes 778 percent tariffs on rice to protect rice farmers, but it imports around 770,000 tons of rice annually without tariffs under socalled \"minimum access\" quotas. Some 360,000 tons of that is from the United States. In the Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade framework through 1994, Japan accepted the minimum access quotas for rice in exchange for receiving preferential treatment on rice tariffication, although consumption was already dwindling. Before that, Japan had imported little rice from abroad. The decision was not well received by Japanese rice farmers and the latest plan for further expanding rice imports under the TPP could also come under fire, trade observers say.',\n",
       " 'EU and US \\'very close\\' to joint text on regulatory barriers 30 January 2015 Deutsche PresseAgentur EU officials have ambitious goals for a proposed free trade deal with the US although progress in the talks has been slow. Now the two sides may be close to a text on overarching regulatory issues, according to a Commission source. European Commission negotiators are hoping for rapid progress with US officials next week on regulatory issues in the controversial transatlantic free trade agreement, according to an EU source. \"We are very close to the point when we will have a consolidated text on all three pillars of the horizontal regulatory barriers,\" the Commission official close to the talks , adding that such a consolidated text, meaning a joint EUUS proposal, could be ready shortly after the negotiation round. These socalled horizontal issues, which cut across economic sectors, include technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary issues (SPS, concerning animals and plants), and a chapter on regulatory cooperation. The latter would aim to promote continuous talks between EU and US regulators and convergence of laws affecting trade after the agreement is in place. \"This is a European proposal on which the United States has not formally reacted,\" the source added on the regulatory cooperation idea. The possible agreement, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), would create the largest free trade area in the world and eliminate tariffs and market access barriers in services and public procurement. Specific sectors will also be discussed, with hopes that mutual recognition of legislation, harmonisation of rules or other measures could help companies do business more easily on both sides of the Atlantic. \"Nearly all the topics are going to be discussed,\" the official . Other topics that will be discussed include cars, machinery and engineering, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, information and communication technologies, pesticides, geographical indicators for agriculture, energy and public procurement. The round will not include discussion of competition issues or investment protection, which has been put on hold by the Commission for internal discussions due to public opposition. Differences persist amid hopes of restart The TTIP talks, to take place between February 2 and 6 in Brussels, will be the eighth round and the first since the new Commission under President JeanClaude Juncker took office in November. EU officials are hoping for a \"fresh start\" in the negotiations as they also follow the US congressional elections which saw the conservative Republicans gain a majority in the Senate and tighten their hold of the House of Representatives. There had been lackluster progress in the talks as each side refused to budge on a number of red lines. The Republicans have been positive on completing a trade deal, but are opposed to the EU geographical indicators for agricultural products, which they consider discriminatory, and strongly support controversial provisions for InvestorState Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which would allow foreign companies to sue governments before transnational courts for alleged violation of investor rights. The Commission for its part is still pushing the US to commit to give up protectionist measures such as limiting public procurement to native companies through \\'Buy America\\' legislation and the 1920 Jones Act requirement that US maritime shipping be done by Americanmade boats. \"For the time being the United States has made very clear that it is a huge political sensitivity attached to the Jones Act,\" the EU source . He added that public procurement was \"one of our top market access priorities\" and \"the most sensitive issue in the United States.\" EU officials are also pushing for a specific chapter on energy and raw materials, aimed in particular at liberalising US oil and gas exports to EU. \"The United States is not yet convinced on that,\" the Commission official . Followup rounds have yet to be scheduled, although the official suggested the next could take place in the US in April and the following one in Brussels before the summer break.',\n",
       " 'Expert urges U.S.Cuba trade and investment deals 30 January 2015 Xinhua News Agency The United States should strike trade and investment deals with Cuba as the two countries are moving toward the normalization of relations, a leading U.S. trade expert  Thursday. \"I think the U.S. strategic goal should be trade and investment agreements with Cuba,\"  Gary Clyde Hufbauer at a panel discussion about next steps in U.S.Cuba economic relations. \"Very tough and very prolonged sanctions do not guarantee political change,\" Hufbauer  when noting the key lessons learned from U.S. embargo against Cuba for over 50 . \"But with carefully designed carrots, we may slowly nudge Cuba ... stepbystep toward a market economy.\" While Cuba is \"not nearly ready for\" a free trade agreement, the United States could have a bilateral trade agreement and a bilateral investment treaty with Cuba,  Hufbauer, who coauthored a book on the normalization of economic ties between the United States and Cuba. The Obama administration earlier this month decided to loosen restrictions on travel, trade and financial transactions with Cuba, following the announcement of commitment by the two governments to restoring diplomatic ties in December. Experts say the restoration of diplomatic relations could open a lot of business opportunities, but it will take a long time for the United States and Cuba to restore economic ties to something close to normal. On the one hand, U.S. Congress is unlikely to lift economic embargo against Cuba soon, with many Republicans still opposed to any change in current policy. On the other hand, Cuba is not ready to open its market to the outside world. \"We predict the winds of change may blow slowly,\"  Barbara Kotschwar, a colleague of Hufbauer who coauthored the book. \"More U.S. companies can now sell to Cuba, but the ban on financing remains in place,\" Kotschwar , adding that U.S. officials should begin economic negotiations with Cuba. U.S. companies are eager to do business in Cuba. MasterCard last week became the first major U.S. credit card company to say it would start handling U.S. card transactions in Cuba. Analysts say it very hard to predict what future economic relations will look like between the two countries, as U.S.Cuba normalization may hit a number of roadblocks. But lifting the economic embargo would be significant economically for both countries. Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that U.S. exports of goods to Cuba could eventually reach 4.3 billion U.S. dollars annually, and Cuban exports of goods to the United States could reach 5.8 billion dollars annually, if the embargo had been lifted. The stock of direct investment from all foreign countries in Cuba might eventually reach 17 billion dollars, up from less than 1 billion dollars today, they added.',\n",
       " 'Chinas SelfDestructive Tech Crackdown New York Times 31 January 2015 Under the guise of improving security, the Chinese government is clamping down on technology companies and further limiting the access its citizens have to information that is not sanitized by the Communist Party. These moves will hurt the Chinese economy and create a major rift between China and the rest of the world. The government of President Xi Jinping has taken a series of steps recently that have unnerved businesses, human rights organizations and governments around the world. This week, for example, American and other foreign business groups sent a letter to Mr. Xi protesting new policies that require companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over their source code to the government and to create ways for security officials to monitor and control those devices. Industry executives expect similar policies to be enacted for other sectors of the Chinese economy, making it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for foreign technology vendors to sell their products to Chinese customers. Chinese officials have also proposed a law, purportedly to fight terrorism, that would require technology companies to provide the government with the means to monitor all communications over their systems in China, including those that are encrypted. And in recent weeks, the authorities have made it nearly impossible for Internet users to employ virtual private networks that allow people to evade the government filters and restrictions collectively known as the Great Firewall. Dissidents, researchers, businesses and professionals have long used V.P.N.s to access information beyond Chinas borders, and the government previously seemed to tolerate the practice. With these new moves, Chinese leaders are trying to increase government control over communications in order to suppress dissent. And they are trying to promote Chinese technology businesses at the expense of foreign companies. That is not entirely surprising. Mr. Xi has previously made clear that he considers the free flow of information on the Internet a threat to the Communist Party. And he has  that he considers domestic control over technology a matter of national economic security, defense security and other aspects of security. But this push for greater control could cost China dearly. The countrys businesses and professionals say it has become increasingly difficult for them to communicate with customers and suppliers abroad or to obtain scientific data and research from the rest of the world. Executives at Chinese banks are reportedly worried that they will have to rely on substandard domestic computer equipment that could make their systems more vulnerable to hacking by criminals, foreign rivals and others. Foreign businesses and governments are rightly saying these new policies amount to protectionism. The changes also seem to make a joke of Chinas commitment to abide by global trading rules established by the World Trade Organization and of its stated desire to deepen trade and investment ties with the United States and other countries. Officials from China and the United States are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty that is supposed to make it easier for companies from each country to do business in the other nation. American officials should use those talks to put China on notice that its latest security policies are wrongheaded and unacceptable. Mr. Xi cannot expect the United States or any other country to engage in negotiations to liberalize trade and investment with his country while his government is actively making it impossible for foreign businesses to survive there.',\n",
       " \"WTO member countries determined to make progress on Doha 31 January 2015 Bulletin Quotidien Europe The resolve expressed at the World Economic Forum in Davos last weekend to make progress in the Doha round talks was this week confirmed in Geneva. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo welcomed the strong engagement shown by the WTO member countries during the meeting of the trade negotiations committee on Thursday 29 January. We have made more progress in a week than we did in the first six months of 2014 () Members have started to go into more detail and to engage on the substance. While substantive positions haven't changed a great deal since last time these issues were discussed, it is clear to me that the tone of the discussion has changed. Despite the gaps between positions, I sensed a desire to overcome them,  Azevedo. He also noted a willingness to entertain new thinking in certain areas. Now it is time to move from ideas to proposals. This is still going to be incredibly difficult but I never thought it would be impossible, and I haven't changed my mind, he added. Intensive work awaits the negotiations from the 160 member countries in the first six months of this  in order to develop a clear and realistic work programme around sections that were not resolved in the Doha round particularly agriculture, industrial products and services. During an informal meeting organised by Switzerland on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 24 January, trade ministers from around 20 WTO member countries asserted their resolve to engage constructively in order to define, by July, a clear and realistic work programme around the negotiation themes that were not resolved at the Doha round. They also stated that the emphasis should be placed on issues of interest for the less developed countries, according to a press release published by the Swiss federal department of the economy on 24 January. The ministers also hailed the invitation from Kenya which will host the 10th WTO ministerial conference in Nairobi in December. I've been following the WTO issues for five . I've never had such a feeling of progress,  Swiss trade minister, Johann SchneiderAmmann, who chaired the meeting attended by the ministers of around 20 countries Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico; Norway, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the USA and the EU with the notable exception of India.\",\n",
       " 'U.S. Government Finds That When Enforcing Trade Rules, No Good Deed Goes Unpunished Forbes.com 31 January 2015 President Obama  in his State of the Union Address that his administration was cracking the whip on trade partners that break the rules. And so it did this week; the Commerce Department hit China with punitive tariffs in retaliation for its dumping of solar panels in the U.S. market. Youd think the U.S. solar industry would be popping the champagne corks and singing Happy Days are Here Again. But no. Theyre not happy about it at all. We dont think its good for anyone,  John Smirnow, the Solar Energy Industry Associations vice president for trade and competitiveness. We dont see U.S. solar manufacturers directly benefiting, he , because the trade sanctions against China will increase the cost of solar power here and make it less competitive against other fuels. A Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment. The Chinese have been dumping solar panels on the U.S. market, i.e., selling them for less than their fair market value, for . They can pull this off because the Chinese government subsidizes the solar industry, such as by giving solar panel manufacturers free land on which to build their factories. This is patently unfair and a clear violation of WTO rules. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled as such on Jan. 21. The ITC ruling authorized the Commerce Department to retaliate against China with antidumping and countervailing duties and Commerce took the initial steps in that process this week. Countervailing duties are applied when a foreign government is found to be subsidizing exports to the United States. Its not just domestic solar manufacturers who dislike the Commerce Departments approach. The companies that buy and install solar panels like it even less. They were buying from China at WalMart prices and apparently didnt care that China was breaking the rules. Theyre going to have to start paying fair market value for solar panels and theyre miffed about it. So are environmentalists. Theyre afraid the retaliatory measures against China will slow the growth of solar power in the U.S. Smirnow  a better solution would have been a negotiated agreement with China. Theres at least one problem with that argument: the Chinese are inveterate cheaters who regularly renege on their agreements. China was also accused of dumping solar panels on the EU market. After an investigation confirmed it, the EU decided to negotiate instead of retaliating. The two sides reached a settlement in July 2013. Soon afterward, a group of European solar manufacturers accused China of reneging on it. Not one Chinese manufacturer seems to follow the agreed minimum prices for imports into the EU,  the president of EU ProSun in Germany. This led to another investigation and another negotiated settlement in March 2014. Now, the Chinese are accused of dumping solar glass, an  component of solar panels, into the EU, so yet another investigation is underway. The Shanghai Daily reported on Jan. 30 that Chinas trading partners initiated 97 investigations into its exports in 2014. Sixtyone of them concerned dumping. The paper suggested that other countries were attacking China through the WTO, because they were jealous of Chinas growth. The United States has the worlds largest economy, the worlds highest per capita income and the worlds highest consumer buying power. For other countries, getting dutyfree access to this market is like winning the lottery. That makes it doubly  that the U.S send a message to its trading partners: either you play by the rules or you get stung. Negotiating a settlement with China in the solar dumping case would not have sent that message.',\n",
       " 'Firms prepare for new tax rules as China vows crackdown 1 February 2015 Reuters News The Chinese government vow to increase tax scrutiny of foreign companies has sent firms rushing to tax advisors ahead of the implementation on Sunday of new rules designed to rein in crossborder tax avoidance. Tax professionals and business lobbies alike have welcomed the move as an attempt to bring China tax regime more in line with international standards. But it has also caused concern that authorities could use the policy, which came into effect on Feb. 1, as a political tool to put the pinch on foreign companies, on top of what business lobbies lament is an increasingly tough business climate in the world second largest economy. \"We\\'ve definitely been getting a lot of questions from clients on how to avoid being investigated for antiavoidance measures,\"  Roberta Chang, a Shanghaibased tax lawyer at Hogan Lovells. The measures, an elaboration on China existing \"general antiavoidance rule\" or GAAR framework, have more companies taking a hard look at how they structure their businesses. Under the new policy, for example, a firm that invests in China through companies in Hong Kong or Singapore to take advantage of tax benefits that do not exist between China and its home country could find itself on the wrong side of Beijing tax authorities if it cannot prove it has substantial business operations there or employees on the ground. \"Companies are increasingly putting substance in their holding companies,\" Chang . Andrew Choy, Greater China International Tax Services Leader at Ernst & Young,  the GAAR rules are a signal that companies need to pay attention to tax planning. \"In general, people will be more conservative,\" Choy . Chinese regulators hit Microsoft Corp with about $140 million in back taxes last November, an early case of what could be a wave of \"targeted actions\" to stop profits going overseas, according officials at China State Administration of Taxation. With a slowing economy likely to reduce 2015 fiscal revenue growth to a threedecade low of just 1 percent, according to a Deutsche Bank report, it makes sense for Beijing to try to boost its coffers. Tax specialists say companies need to be aware that China tax regime is evolving, albeit as part of a global trend to curb tax avoidance. At a meeting of G20 leaders in Australia in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping endorsed a global effort to crack down on international tax avoidance. \"Compared to the U.S. or the UK, China tax rules are still simpler. But China doesn\\'t want to be seen as an undeveloped country with tax rules. It wants to catch up to other international players,\" Chang, of Hogan Lovells . FAIR AND TRANSPARENT? At the forefront of evolving international tax policy is the debate about whether the right to tax should be tilted towards industrialised, capital exporting countries where firms reside, or socalled source countries such as China, where many generate significant profit. \"There is a large element from a government policy perspective that has to do with whether China is going to tax particular profits or some other country,\"  Jon Eichelberger, a tax expert and partner at Baker & McKenzie Beijing office. Chinese state media has  tax evasion and avoidance by foreign companies costs the world second largest economy at least 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in tax revenues each . Larry Sussman, managing partner at O\\'Melveny & Myers\\' Beijing office,  the scope of the scrutiny could also reach private equity firms and M&A activity. \"Anything crossborder coming in and coming out, for that matter, which could implicate Chinese investors,\" Sussman . Despite the elaboration to the GAAR rules, they remain loosely defined, giving tax authorities discretion on whether companies meet the demands for economic substance. James Zimmerman, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China,  Chamber members welcomed an upgrade to the tax regime, so long as the policies were consistent with China World Trade Organization obligations. \"AmChamChina is hopeful that the Chinese government will apply the tax laws and regulations in a fair, uniform, and transparent manner, and we will be monitoring China enforcement record going forward on behalf of our member companies,\" Zimmerman .',\n",
       " 'China intends to turn inward for technology, threatening U.S. sales Bloomberg News 31 January 2015 Chinese regulators summoned bank officials for a meeting this month to emphasize the need to carry out a nationwide directive to cut China reliance on foreign technology,  people familiar with the matter. In the Jan. 15 meeting, the China Banking Regulatory Commission suggested lenders not buy new mainframe computers in 2015 and draft plans to replace the ones they now have,  the people, who asked not to be identified. A senior CBRC official  in November banks rely on foreign brands for 80 percent of their core servers and systems. The directive is a followup on a broad national strategy, reported by Bloomberg News in December, to purge most foreign technology for banks, stateowned enterprises and the military by 2020. The move, which would grant reprieve to foreign companies that turn over their core technology, threatens sales for vendors including Microsoft, IBM Corp. and Cisco Systems. The CBRC told bank officials in the meeting to think of ways to use more domestic products or foreign brands that comply with government demands to share core technology or give China security inspectors access to their products, the people . They  banks should also draft a five plan on making the transition. China displacement plan and its intention to start a new national security review mechanism have raised concern among U.S. business groups. In a letter Jan. 28, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 17 other groups called for urgent talks with Chinese Communist Party officials on the \"growing trend\" of policies toward using Chinesedeveloped or \"secure and controllable\" information communications technology. \"Our concern is not with the goal of enhancing security, but with the means to reach it,\"  the letter to the party Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs. The CBRC didn\\'t respond to a faxed request for comment Thursday. China has benefited from global integration through the World Trade Organization, the letter . The country share of information, communication and technology exports rose to 30 percent in 2012 from 2 percent in 1996, it . China has carried out a trial to test whether NeoKylin, a Linuxbased operating system from China Standard Software, can substitute for Windows, people familiar with the matter  in December. Servers are one technology product in which Chinese brands have seen sales surge while foreign providers posted lower shipments. In the third quarter of last , HewlettPackard Co. server shipments fell by 14.9 percent and IBM fell by 15 percent, according to the research group Gartner Inc. At the same time, shipments by Inspur rose 81.9 percent, while Huawei Technologies Co. posted an increase of 34.3 percent. \"In line with China World Trade Organization commitments, it is of critical importance that policies be developed in a transparent and open manner,\" the U.S. business groups  in the letter. Business groups signing the message letter include The Software Alliance, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Telecommunications Industry Association and the USChina Business Council.',\n",
       " 'Asia trade talks heat up as fasttrack battle rages Politico, 31 January 2015 Talks have accelerated on what would be the biggest trade deal in world history thanks to a Republican Congress that wants to give President Barack Obama more power to negotiate the agreement and a group of Asian nations that are closer than ever to making concessions on consumer goods sold around the globe. Here at the AsiaPacific trade talks, a mad scramble is underway among pharmaceutical giants, major clothing companies and big agricultural groups who are trying to influence the outcome of the TransPacific Partnership negotiations, a proposed agreement stretching from Chile to Japan that would encompass 40 percent of global gross domestic product and about a third of world trade. Theres a real air of seriousness about concluding these talks and getting to the finish line, and everything I saw here this week reaffirms that the U.S. government is firmly committed to trying to get this done in the 30 to 60 days or whatever the time period is,  Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, which lobbies on behalf of the U.S. textile industry. Tantillo and other lobbyists and interest groups were busy meeting with officials from Vietnam, New Zealand and the 10 other countries in the talks, which are taking place at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel. Trade officials could be spotted holding court at large circular tables as lobbyists and advocates pitched their positions on everything from apparel rules to access to medicines. Dozens of lobbyists and industry group leaders descended on the hotel this week to roam the halls in an attempt to push negotiators toward their positions on controversial areas like drug patents and agricultural protections, which are still unresolved after nearly five  of negotiations. At the same time, trade officials are taking notice of the new atmosphere in Washington. Obama is, for the first time, publicly calling for trade promotion authority legislation that will ease the passage of the agreement in Congress. This is throwing talks into a higher gear as we enter the home stretch,  Trevor Kincaid, a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. While Congress and the administration are preparing for the end game, so are the teams. We are making good progress in a number of areas and teams are checking remaining issues off the list, Kincaid added. Pressure to complete a deal is growing. At some point next month, lawmakers are preparing to introduce the trade promotion bill, which has been buoyed by the GOP takeover of Congress last November that put Senate Republicans only a handful of votes away from a filibusterproof majority of support for trade and widened the margin of tradefriendly Republicans in the House. The fasttrack bill, as the legislation is also known, would expedite the passage of the AsiaPacific deal in Congress by putting it to an upordown vote, limiting debate and preventing lawmakers from offering amendments to the agreement. Its passage is expected to give countries in the deal, which have a combined GDP more than twothirds greater than that of the NAFTA nations, more confidence to negotiate without fear of Congress picking the agreement apart and reversing hardwon gains or concessions a magical ingredient that will catalyze the talks, moving them into the endgame. Weve seen a great level of optimism by the United States since the midterm elections, and U.S. industry stakeholders have been promoting a highly positive spin about TPA,  Yves Leduc, director of international trade for the Dairy Farmers of Canada. I think there is recognition that 2015 is the window in which they are working, he . With the legislation imminent, the uncertain deadlines that have plagued the talks are giving way to a more concrete timeline for getting a deal done in the coming months. Trade ministers could meet as soon as March, when they would try to reach an agreement in principle representing what a final deal will look like, sources close to the negotiations  here this week. The shortened timeline is forcing action at the negotiating table, prompting the country officials and interest groups to tip their hands on their true bottom lines. Whatever the negotiators decide to include in the trade deal could have a ripple effect on entire industries, with the potential to offshore more U.S. textile jobs and impact the financial feasibility of drug research and development, to name two possibilities. Those and other interest groups say they are fighting for their lives and those for whom they advocate in some cases literally as in the case of strict new drug patent rules that could limit access to cheap generic medicines in the developing world. For Leduc, its now a matter of mounting a major defense. Canada protects his industry and others poultry and eggs through a socalled supply management system, which restricts imports and tightly controls production as a way of stabilizing those sectors and theyre coming under fire in the 11th hour to open up their markets to more U.S. imports. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, wielded a block of smoked Gouda from his home state while stressing the importance of prying open dairy access to the Canadian market during a trade hearing with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman this week. U.S. negotiators were unsuccessful in gaining such access through the NAFTA. Exports are becoming only more  in the entire U.S. dairy sector Ryan . Im concerned that Japan is not doing nearly enough and that Canada is not even negotiating to remove significant tariff and nontariff barriers to U.S. dairy. Other groups are rushing to make sure final concessions reflect their interests. Were still very much focused on the negotiators,  Rohit Malpani, director of policy and advocacy at Doctors Without Borders. We still think there is opportunity for other countries to really push back against what continues to be the worst trade agreement in terms of access to medicines that has ever been negotiated. His organization has been making its position known in the skies above New York City, flying an aerial banner along the Hudson River that reads: Doctors to Obama: Keep #TPP Away From Our Medicines. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is pushing for strong patent protections and long periods of data protection for cuttingedge biological drugs. Companies argue those protections are needed to create a financial incentive for recovering the massive costs involved in developing the medicines. It was a point that Froman alluded to in outlining both sides of the issue at Tuesdays hearing. We have 40 million Americans whose jobs are related to IP [intellectual property]intensive industries, Froman . And our goal is on one hand to promote innovation and creativity in this country, and also to ensure access to affordable medicines particularly in developing countries. Public health advocates like Malpani, however, argue that much of what the industry is demanding would only extend patent monopolies in developing countries and cut off access to affordable generic versions. They werent pulling any punches this week when they brought in Nobel Prizewinning economist Joseph Stiglitz to brief negotiators on what he argues is at stake in the agreements drug provisions. Maybe not in your family, but in somebody elses family somebody will die as a result of what you do or do not do in this agreement, or their lifestyle will be affected significantly, he told room full of trade officials. U.S. textile industry officials were also out in force this week, pressing U.S. officials to stand firm on rules that would help preserve an industry that has been in dire straits for . Vietnam, an apparelmaking powerhouse, is pushing for a deal that would be boon to its massive export industry, which is second only to Chinas in size. Were here this week delivering the same very clear and consistent message that an agreement has to be balanced, Tantillo . It has to be good and not just for folks who do the final assembly such as apparel makers, it also has to balanced for folks who produce the inputs, the components, the yarns and fabrics. Past trade deals have been careful to safeguard whats left of the American textile industry, guided by vigilant members of Congress with strong textile constituencies. Washington is already standing firm behind a yarnforward rule that would allow tariff reductions only for clothing sewn from fabric made in TPP countries. Right now, Vietnam gets much of its cloth from China, which is currently excluded from the deal. The domestic industry is also continuing to push for reasonable periods of time for phasing out tariffs on textile imports from Vietnam. We believe the government is fully absorbing our input, Tantillo . But big apparel companies like Gap and Nike, which have major production in Vietnam, want the rules of origin to be more flexible, allowing tariff cuts on clothes and shoes made of fabric from China and other countries not currently in the agreement and theyre starting to gain a voice in Congress from members whose districts or states are home to the companies headquarters or production facilities. Youve got members asking if the rules of origin are going to be flexible enough to do business,  Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Thats not a line of questioning youve seen in the past.',\n",
       " 'Obama trade push strains alliances 31 January 2015 The Burlington Free Press President Obama is engaging an unfamiliar opponent in his effort to advance his trade agenda this : congressional Democrats. For the first time in his six  in the White House, the president is more at odds with his own party than Republicans as he pushes for enhanced authority to negotiate trade pacts. The battle will test his powers of persuasion and his relationships among even his closest allies on Capitol Hill. \"Show me a trade deal that not only increases (gross domestic product), but increases the average worker monthly paycheck, and I\\'ll be for it: That the message,\" Rep. Steve Israel, DN.Y.,  Thursday. \"And if the administration can get us there, it\\'ll pass with Democratic votes.\" Top Senate Democrats are skeptical. \"I\\'ve always been suspect in my entire career in Congress of these trade agreements,\" Minority Leader Harry Reid, DNev.,  last week. \"Why? Because I have not been shown that these trade agreements have helped the middle class.\" House Democrats are meeting here for their threeday annual retreat in which the party is ruminating over sweeping losses in last  elections that saw Republicans grow their majority in the House and take control of the Senate. The prevailing view among Democrats is that the party has to do a better job communicating and advancing an agenda that appeals to middleincome Americans, and trade pacts do not fit neatly in that lane. \"A lot of Americans were told that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was going to work for them personally, and it didn\\'t,\" Israel . Obama and Vice President Biden will meet privately with Democrats to discuss their agenda, but other speakers at the same event pressed lawmakers to fight the administration on trade. AFLCIO President Richard Trumka urged Democrats here to oppose granting Obama fasttrack negotiating authority. Fasttrack is a controversial power that would give a president significant leeway to negotiate trade deals, allowing Congress only a yesorno vote on the final package. Lawmakers couldn\\'t amend or filibuster an agreement. Fasttrack authority expired in 2007, and Obama wants it renewed to enhance the administration negotiating hand. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, RUtah, intends to bring fasttrack up for a committee vote in late February, and a floor showdown could come in March.',\n",
       " 'The math says trade pact job creation is zero, not 650,000 1 February 2015 The Washington Post \"Estimates are that the TPP [TransPacific Partnership] could provide $77 billion a  in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the U.S. alone.\" Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in an opinion article, Jan. 14 \"Completing the TransPacific Partnership provides the opportunity to open up markets, lower tariffs and, according to the Peterson Institute, increase U.S. exports by $123 billion and help support an additional 650,000 jobs.\" Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, in an interview with the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report, Jan. 26 The Fact Checker frequently warns readers to be wary of claims by politicians that various policy initiatives will yield tens of thousands of jobs. Such claims are often based on studies that rely on a variety of assumptions, any of which can be called into question. So we were interested when we received a call from a reader who wondered how the administration calculated that a proposed international trade agreement, known as the TransPacific Partnership, would support 650,000 jobs. The Obama administration is on a fullcourt press to complete negotiations on the trade pact, involving 12 Pacific Rim nations, and also win from Congress the authority for an upordown vote from lawmakers, which officials say is necessary to close the deal. The TPP is one of the few areas in which the White House can expect strong support from Republicans, though many Democrats remain skeptical or hostile. The Fact Checker, of course, takes no position on whether the proposed trade deal is good or bad. But we were curious about how this number was calculated. Notice that Vilsack referred to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is a wellregarded centrist think tank that focuses on international economic policy. The Peterson Institute advocates for freetrade agreements but also for programs that aid people who may be hurt by globalization. In 2012, the Peterson Institute published a book on the TPP by Peter A. Petri, Michael G. Plummer and Fan Zhai. The book does include an estimate that, by 2025, the United States would experience a gain of $77.5 billion in income from TPP, as well as a $124 billion increase in exports. (More on those numbers, which are expressed in 2007 dollars, below.) But nowhere in the book does it say 650,000 jobs would be created. Asked about the statistic on 650,000 jobs, the White House referred us to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Spokesman Matthew McAlvanah directed us to page 58 of the book. \"They do not provide an estimate on jobs,\" he acknowledged. \"However, they do provide a methodology that one could use.\" Essentially, the book suggests that an income gain of $121,000 would be \"roughly equivalent to creating an extra job.\" So the Obama administration took the figure of $77.5 billion and divided it by $121,000, which yields 640,000. Rounded up, that becomes 650,000. There just one problem. This is the incorrect way to use Petri research, especially when officials such as Kerry combine the jobs figure in the same sentence as the income prediction. Again, Kerry statement: \"The TPP could provide $77 billion a  in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the U.S. alone.\" The calculation on jobs can only be done if one assumes that wages have been frozen and there is no income gain. So it completely misleading to suggest there would be both a gain in income and a gain in jobs. Petri  that his book did not discuss job gains because economists do not believe that job growth is significantly affected by trade policy. \"The reason we don\\'t project employment is that, like most trade economists, we don\\'t believe that trade agreements change the labor force in the long run. The consequential factors are demography, immigration, retirement benefits, et cetera,\" he . \"Rather, trade agreements affect how people are employed, and ideally substitute more productive jobs for less productive ones, and thus raise real incomes.\" The same dynamic exists with the claim that the trade bill would increase exports by $124 billion by 2025. The Commerce Department estimates that about 5,500 jobs are supported by every $1 billion in exports, so in theory that also would yield about 650,000 jobs. But that calculation would ignore the fact that the Petri book found that imports would increase by virtually the same amount as exports, meaning the net number of new jobs is zero. The mix of jobs would change, however. \"Employment could be negatively affected by the adjustment implications of a trade agreement,\" Petri . \"We estimate job shifts employment moving from one sector to another and in difficult labor markets such shifts can lead to transitional unemployment, retirement or wage cuts. \"In the case of the TPP,\" Petri added, \"such shifts will be small and slow, dwarfed by routine job separations and new hires in the economy. So adjustments and costs should be covered many times by gains. This makes possible strong transitional assistance for workers and communities that are adversely affected.\" Finally, let put these numbers in context. Petri book says that a gain of $77.5 billion in income amounts to just a 0.4 percent increase in the predeal baseline for the United States\\' $20trillion gross domestic product. You read that right: 0.4 percent. Indeed, a gain of 650,000 jobs would also be just 0.4 percent of projected employment of 168 million people, Petri . \"The percentage change is small,\" Petri acknowledged, which he  is what one would expect from a large and efficient economy such as the United States. McAlvanah provided a lengthy response that highlighted the various ways one could calculate 650,000 jobs from the Petri data, but the statement did not address the fact that the study itself did not offer these calculations or that effects of one action, such as more exports, are canceled out by another action, such as imports. There is a long history of presidential administrations touting imaginary job gains from trade deals. Bill Clinton, relying in part on jobs predictions from the Peterson Institute, in 1993 predicted the North American Free Trade Agreement would yield 200,000 jobs in two  and a million in five. Neither turned out to be true. Clearly, with the Peterson Institute refusing to play the game this time and cough up a jobs number, the Obama administration decided to concoct its own. But, as we have shown, one cannot at the same time claim both a gain of $77 billion in income and a gain of 650,000 jobs. The same effects simply cannot happen at once. Moreover, these are big numbers with virtually no context. It is pretty lame to use such huge numbers to tout what, in the context of the U.S. economy, amounts to minuscule changes in income 10  from now. Our advice remains: Be wary whenever a politician claims a policy will yield bountiful jobs. In this case, the correct number is zero (in the long run), not 650,000, according to the very study used to calculate this number. Administration officials earn Four Pinocchios for their fishy math.',\n",
       " 'EU, US look for \\'fresh start\\' in trade talks 1 February 2015 Agence France Presse US negotiators travel to EU headquarters in Brussels Monday to jumpstart talks on the world biggestever free trade deal, which after nearly two  remain bogged down by public opposition. The future of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Pact, or TTIP, is in doubt in the face of bitter opposition by activists and mixed signals from key governments, including Europe biggest economy Germany. \"This is the dirtiest trade deal in Europe history,\" a new video posted by the antiTTIP group Corporate Europe . Particularly controversial is a plan to let companies have legal disputes with governments heard by supranational tribunals, which campaigners say would undermine national sovereignty and favour corporations. The historic drive to create a market of 850 million people, linking the 28nation European Union and the United States, began 20 months ago and on the eve of the eighth round of talks many believe the process is at a makeorbreak stage. The four days of talks starting Monday will be the first since the new European Commission led by JeanClaude Juncker took office in November, with the outspoken Swede Cecilia Malmstroem charged to salvage the talks as the new trade commissioner. \"This is the first round after the fresh start. I am very curious how things have developed,\"  Luisa Santos of Business Europe, an influential probusiness and proTTIP lobby in Brussels. The ambitious pact would be unique in history, analysts . It would not just slash the already low trade tariffs between the world two top economies, but crucially it would also harmonise regulations to an unprecedented degree, affecting goods and services as farranging as Roquefort cheese and accounting. \"We are dealing mainly with regulation and more specifically, deregulation,\"  Tom Jenkins, a senior advisor at ETUC, a European trade union group. \"People are quizzical to say the very least,\" he . Campaigners are convinced that powerful interests are selling the consumer short in secret negotiations. But instead of setting aside negative opinion, as is often the case in the early rounds of trade talks, the EU decided to face the critics, embracing dialogue and transparency, at least to a degree. \"We are aware of the sensitivities, of all the concerns and criticisms,\" an EU source told AFP. \"We are also aware of our own efforts towards transparency and we are also aware that more can be done.\" The EU has even published texts that previously would have remained confidential, including the bloc official negotiating mandate. \"Traditionally, trade deals were made in smokefilled rooms, behind closed doors. TTIP is the first where there is a crack in the door,\" Jenkins . But the most contentious part of the deal may be the hardest to get rid of, given how keen the United States is to include rules for investor protection. The InvestorState Dispute Settlement, or ISDS, allows firms to sue national governments through tribunals instead of national courts if they feel that local laws such as health and safety regulations violate the trade deal and threaten their investments. The influential German government has blown hot and cold on the clause despite greenlighting the EU mandate to achieve it. Opposition to ISDS became so intense that Malmstroem predecessor Karel De Gucht, in order to move the talks forward, excluded it from the USEU negotiations pending the outcome of a public consultation. The EU received almost 150,000 replies an EU record and almost all were negative. \"The consultation clearly shows that there is a huge scepticism against the ISDS instrument\", Malmstroem . AntiTTIP protesters also handed in a petition signed by 1.1 million people. To make matters worse, some in the EU question Washington true commitment to the deal, fearing it might be more interested in Asia. \"We have to ensure there is strong political commitment from both sides,\"  Business Europe Santos. But US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland recently swiped away such talk, calling for a \"transatlantic renaissance\".',\n",
       " 'Beijingbacked pact seeks blueprint 31 January 2015 South China Morning Post Steps are under way to draft a framework for a proposed freetrade pact that Beijing is championing as a rival bloc to a USled trade initiative that excludes China. The Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), encompassing members of the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) grouping, has received highprofile support from the Beijing leadership. The study will draw on input from the Apec Business Advisory Council (Abac), with the goal of drawing up a blueprint for the trade pact by the end of this , according to Doris Ho, the chairwomen of the advisory group comprising privatesector representatives that makes recommendations to the Apec economies. Its going to be a wholelong study, hopefully shorter, Ho  at a press conference by the council yesterday at the end of a fourday meeting in Hong Kong. Were going to get consultants and experts to study all the existing [free trade] agreements, she . Were going to see what are the ones that are really effective. Eventually you take and pick from everybodys experience, and then we end up with a framework hopefully for what the FTAAP would look like. We have to give that in before the end of the  to the leaders. The FTAAP is seen by some as a rival trade pact to the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), which is being negotiated by the US and 11 other countries, but excludes China. An Apec leaders summit in Beijing at the end of last  agreed to launch a study into the proposal. President Xi Jinping urged Apec members at the meeting to speed up talks on the trade liberalisation framework, which he described as a historic step. Aside from the FTAAP and the TPP, 16 countries including China and the 10 Asean members have been negotiating another freetrade agreement known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This grouping also includes South Korea, Japan, India, New Zealand and Australia. Ho could not provide a timetable of when the trade pact sought by Abac since 2004 might be implemented. She dismissed any suggestion that the FTAAP would be at odds with the TPP and the RCEP, saying some trade agreements in the region could serve as building blocks for the FTAAP. We would like to see [the FTAAP] really address some of the future emerging economic and business issues,  Ho, who is the 2015 chairwoman for Abac.',\n",
       " 'What Could Happen If the Eurozone Breaks Up? Investopedia 31 January 2015 Fears of a eurozone collapse first surfaced when Standard & Poor downgraded Greek debt to junk status in 2010. That fear hasnt truly left the financial markets since. The possibility of one of the worlds largest economic zones abandoning their shared currency terrifies the financial markets for a good reason. In this article, we will look at the possible fallout of a eurozone collapse. No Escape Hatch At the time of this writing, there is no way to exit the European Union and the euro once a nation joins. That isnt to say that a way couldnt be created. The process of amending the EU treaty is far from simple, though, as other member countries would have legal challenges for any member endangering the eurozone and its shared economic fortunes. It is more realistic to picture a few of the weaker nations abandoning the EU and the euro in a consequences be damned rush that would leave them investment dead zones for , if not decades, as legal and economic challenges piled up. Accounts would be frozen, currencies swapped, and wealth destroyed, but the eurozone would continue with the existing nations taking far more of a hit. This scenario is less likely than bailouts and quantitative easing to keep the weaker nations in the fold. So what would bring about total collapse? The exit of some of the EUs largest economies like Germany and France. In this case, the euro would likely be abandoned en masse and central banks would need to go through the difficult and costly process of switching over to national currencies again. A number of the nations would be taking a serious haircut on the value of whatever currency they float to replace the euro because their individual finances are much weaker than those of the whole. This would likely include all the \"PIIGS,\" as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are sometimes referred. It may include every nation but Germany as it is the strongest economy in the eurozone and one of the main drivers for the euros strength in currency markets. However, Germany would still lose on the whole even with a stronger currency as would every country in the eurozone. Trade Losses The eurozone grew partially out of a desire to make commerce easier across the European continent. The EU is essentially a massive free trade zone with the added advantage in that currency risk is eliminated because of the shared euro for those countries in the eurozone. (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are EU members that are not in the eurozone.) It is unlikely that the open trading would survive the dissolution of the eurozone. Even if it does, the currency differences between nations are going to make current trade relations difficult to maintain. Will people in Greece buy as many Peugeots and Volkswagens when they are 40 or 50 percent more expensive due to the Greek currency being much weaker than a franc or a mark? Doubtful. The differences will reshape production and trade across Europe as companies are reintroduced to the competitive advantages and disadvantages of regional economies and currencies. Worldwide Impact Of course, an unwinding of the eurozone would have huge repercussions for economies all over the world. The worlds largest economy, the United States, has investments and trade ties with the EU that would be negatively impacted by a breakup of either the eurozone or the EU as a whole. On a basic level, many of the euro bonds would take losses when they are translated into another currency or simply defaulted on entirely. This wholesale destruction of capital and the uncertainty of currency risks and contract law would shrink the imports and exports between the United States. This shrinking of the global trade and financial uncertainty could cause a worse global recession than that of the 200708 global financial crisis. The high growth economies that sell to the EU and US would slow down along with the rest of the world. Even China, which has diversified its trading partners, would see a decline as the western economies suffer losses on a national level along with every level of investor from institutional to retail to pension fund. There would be less demand for goods from China, South Korea, and Japan in the downturn, spreading the EU contagion to a region less exposed through traditional investment. Recovery Even if the eurozone were to collapse, the worldwide economy would eventually recover, though there would be regions that go far deeper into recession and depression for multiple . Most European nations would be facing multi recessions or depression. The economic pressures would be matched by political chaos as countries lose pensions, industries, and wealth as a result of the break up. Investors approaching European investments in the aftermath would require a risk premium similar to those of developing nations until trust could be rebuilt. That , trade would eventually come to the rescue as always. French wine, Greek olives, German cars, Italian charcuterie and many other European products would find buyers. The separated economic fortunes and currencies of these nations would ebb and flow as they used to, but commerce within the former eurozone would likely never take place with the ease that it currently does. The world would recover, but the loss of wealth and the new normal would not be an improvement for anyone involved. The Bottom Line A eurozone breakup is extremely unlikely because of the high economic price it would extract from everyone involved. The exit of weaker nations from the shared currency or the larger union is a slightly more realistic possibility, but even that cannot take place under the treaty as agreed to by all member nations. There is no exit strategy for nations in the EU or the eurozone because most members acknowledge that they are far better off together than they ever were apart. ________________________________',\n",
       " 'WTO Members to Discuss Assistance to Developing Countries; Azevedo to U.S. By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 2, 2015 Jan. 30 — World Trade Organization members in Geneva plan to focus on issues related to developing nations during the first week of February. First up is an openended informal meeting of the Special Session Committee on Trade and Development scheduled for Feb. 2. Committee Chairman Ambassador Harald Neple of Norway recently held a round of informal consultations aimed at “finalizing a number of agreementspecific proposals” expected to become the basis of the Special Session work program, according to comments from WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo. Going forward, members of the committee intend to table a “list of the provisions where they would like to see work being done,” Azevedo . “Substantive proposals explaining the rationale, and the problems identified, are expected to be submitted at the second stage,” he . HighLevel LDC Meetings The WTO group of leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) plans to hold a pair of highlevel meetings on Feb. 56 to consider ways to aid developing countries in traderelated services. The objective is to discuss in which services sectors and modes of supply LDC services and service suppliers would be granted preferential treatment. WTO members agreed in 2011 to provide preferential treatment to LDCs services and services suppliers, though no concrete steps have been taken to put that agreement into place. The meetings will be held in Geneva and are considered to be formal meetings of the Council for Trade in Services. Azevedo to U.S Azevedo has not scheduled the  third informal Heads of Delegation meeting. The meetings, part of an intensive process launched by Azevedo in January, are aimed at advancing a detailed work program on the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial agreement and on the Doha Development Agenda by July 31. Instead, Azevedo will travel to the U.S. to meet with leaders of Caterpillar Inc. at the 2015 Leadership Summit in Atlanta Feb. 3. Azevedo will meet with members of the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas in New York Feb. 4. He will deliver the Gabriel Silver Memorial Lecture at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs in New York Feb. 5.',\n",

India and the US have already completed their bilateral consultations on the matter. The consultations were followed after the US filed a complaint in the WTO in February last  alleging discrimination by India national solar mission against American products. As per the procedure of the World Trade Organisation, consultation is the first stage of a complaint filed with the global trade body. According to the official, the US was satisfied with the bilateral deliberations, \"that is why they have gone for setting up of a panel under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism\". Consultations give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter and to find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation. If consultations fail to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel. The US had alleged that India programme appears to discriminate against US solar equipment by requiring solar energy producers to use locally manufactured cells and by offering subsidies to those developers who use domestic equipment. It is also alleged that forced localisation requirements restrict US exports to India markets. On January 11, 2010, India launched its national solar policy the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. India has an ambitious target of generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022. US companies sees this target as a great business opportunity for them. Because of this, they want India to remove the clause of local content requirement.',\n",

Ethanol is produced in India from molasses, a byproduct of sugar production, and the government introduced the mechanism in December aiming to raise output to help curb fossil fuel imports. \"Fixed ethanol pricing is a positive development,\" Abinash Verma told the Kingsman Platts Dubai Sugar Conference. Falling sugar prices in India linked to a supply glut have taken a heavy toll on sugar mills. Last  one of India largest sugar mills, Mawana Sugars Ltd, defaulted on 2.5 billion rupees ($40 million) in outstanding loans from a consortium of lenders, an official from the company . The surplus has depressed local prices, which could fall further unless the government provides incentives for raw sugar exports. Verma  he expected the government to issue a decision on export subsidies this week. \"It is almost through so we expect and we pray it will happen this week,\" he told Reuters. Subsidies helped India raw sugar exports last  and mills have been waiting for news of this  subsidy since the start of the crushing season in October. Verma  India sugar production for the 20142015 season is expected at 26 million tonnes while consumption will be between 24.7 million tonnes and 24.8 million tonnes. \"From what we are hearing the government is proposing around 1.4 million tonnes of assistance for raw sugar. Without government support we would not be in a position to export so whatever government will announce that is the kind of upper ceiling of what we can export,\" Verma . Verma  government policies which impose high prices for the cane used to produce sugar had helped create the surplus and government assistance was therefore needed to get rid of it. \"There is a need for government support for the disposal of surplus sugar,\" he . India exported more than 1 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2014 and mills had hoped to export up to 2 million tonnes this .

       " 'Alberta Officials to Address COOL, Energy Issues During Washington, New York Trips By Jeremy Hainsworth WTO Reporter, February 2, 2015 Jan. 30 — Alberta officials will push for changes to U.S. mandatory countryoforigin labeling (COOL) requirements for imported beef and pork and discuss oil and gas policy during upcoming visits to Washington and New York. Provincial Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Verlyn Olson will visit the U.S. capital Feb. 3–5 to advocate for changes to the U.S. COOL rules. Alberta Premier Jim Prentice will be in Washington and New York Jan. 31 to Feb. 6 to discuss oil and gas production. The COOL rules, unveiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May 2013, require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where an animal was born, raised and slaughtered. The rules also prohibit the mixing of muscle cuts from different countries under a general label. Several business groups have warned that Canada and Mexico could levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if changes to the rules are not made (15 WTO, 1/23/15). “It time for the American government to do what is right and put an end to mandatory Country of Origin Labeling which is clearly a discriminatory trade barrier,” Olson told Bloomberg BNA in a Jan. 29 statement. “The World Trade Organization has ruled three times that the U.S. is failing to meet its trade obligations because of COOL and we fully support the federal government in implementing retaliatory trade measures on U.S. products if necessary.” Olson  that the provincial government will continue to advocate on behalf of Alberta cattle and hog industries and will “oppose these onerous labeling requirements, which are imposing more than a billion dollars annually in unnecessary costs and harm businesses, workers and farmers on both sides of the border.” WTO COOL Ruling on Appeal While the World Trade Organization has ruled that COOL is a violation of U.S. trade obligations, the decision is currently under appeal (243 WTO, 12/18/14). Olson will meet with representatives of agriculture producers, food processors and industry associations opposed to COOL, as well as with members of Congress. Prentice will meet with legislators, administration officials and representatives from the banking, energy and environmental policy sectors and will address the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Foreign Policy Association.

The TFA aims to facilitate crossborder trade by simplifying administrative and documentation requirements, as required by the government, on import and export and reducing costs as well as well following international criteria including electronic ones. The agreement also aims to cut the red tape at the border by coordinating the work of concerned entities, which will eventually achieve balance by boosting trade, streamline the work of the customs that regulate the trade flow in the UAE. His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, VicePresident and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, who chaired the Cabinet meeting at the Presidential Palace,  under the leadership of the President, His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s economy is by now one of the strongest and a model in the world. It is laying strong foundations for the country to assume its international economic leading position.

Efforts will continue to foster an innovationnurturing environment to realise the UAE Vision 2021 for a knowledgebased economy. The Emirati economic model is a sustainable and responsible one ensuring a longterm prosperity for its citizens and residents alike. The economy is robust and can accommodate market changes, open new frontiers and diversity as we have strong infrastructure, technology and logistics,” Shaikh Mohammed . The UAE seeks to innovate new sustainable and competitive economic models as well as adopt more flexible approaches that boost cooperation between the government and private sector which suits its international position as a main economic player.” The Trade Facilitation Agreement will contribute in increasing efficiency, flexibility and productivity in the labour market, given it is a priority for the federal government. It will help facilitate movement and develop businesses across the UAE. Shaikh Mohammed and members of the UAE Cabinet expressed their sadness over the passing of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia. The Cabinet also discussed other topics on the agenda and approved the bylaws of the Etihad Rail through which the company will submit its contracts and agreements to an arbitration clause in case of any disputes. The Cabinet also approved the 2013 closing statement of the General Pension and Social Security Authority as well as the 2015 budget draft of Emirates Transport.

       " 'FOCUS: U.S. gearing up for TPP conclusion, hopes for deal with Japan growing Kakumi Kobayash Kyodo News WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 The United States is stepping up efforts to conclude a Pacific free trade pact soon, a move that also boosts hopes for a deal with Japan that would be necessary for the goal. Unlike the situation some months ago, there has been much talk by U.S. government leaders and lawmakers as well as agricultural groups on how to strike a deal over the TransPacific Partnership initiative on such occasions as a chief negotiators\\' meeting ended Sunday in New York. \"Various movements have emerged in the United States\" recently, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kenichiro Sasae told reporters in late January. \"We welcome President (Barack) Obama leading a bid to strengthen the momentum,\" Sasae , mentioning the U.S. president annual policy speech at Congress last month in which he  his administration will seek \"strong\" trade deals including the U.S.led TPP. Obama in his State of the Union Address asked Congress to give him fasttrack authority to conclude the negotiations over the deal that have already run nearly five . If the president is given the power, which is formally called trade promotion authority or TPA, the government will have only to ask Congress whether it backs a deal across the board without revisions. Obama made a similar call in his address in 2014, but there was a clear difference this  as a majority of the audience consisted of Republicans, who are generally more positive about free trade than Democrats. Days after Obama speech, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman showed his confidence in concluding a TPP within months during a session of the Senate Finance Committee, which handles trade issues. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the committee, expressed his willingness to work on a bill for TPA soon, telling the session, \"I want to make one thing clear. The time for TPA is now.\" The moves came as observers and officials from 12 countries negotiating for a TPP shared the view that the clock is ticking on their bid for a TPP signing before the American public interest shifts to the 2016 presidential election. A positive sign also emerged last month for a settlement of JapanU.S. disputes over TPPrelated issues such as exceptional tariffs on beef, pork and other agricultural produce. Japan and the United States account for some 80 percent of the combined gross domestic product under the envisioned TPP. The National Pork Producers Council, a U.S. agricultural group known for its hardline stance on Japan over TPP negotiations, surprised people involved in the bilateral deal when the council  it is \"all in\" on TPA. \"Significant progress has been made with respect to Japan market access offer on pork,\" Howard Hill, president of the council,  in a statement. Last , the council proposed excluding Japan from the TPP negotiations unless there was progress on the exceptional tariff issue. The council did not elaborate on why it changed its position but a Japanese government official presumed the group thought now is the best time to make a deal. \"The U.S. and Japan do not agree to a bilateral deal on market access. Until a few weeks ago, I would have shared the skepticism about that,\" Matthew Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told a recent event. \"I think things have moved substantially in the last few weeks,\"  Goodman, a former senior official of the White House under Obama. But Goodman noted it is premature to talk about the time frame of a proposed TPA bill and the TPP talks, as it took several to 10 months before TPA was finally introduced in past cases. Details of ongoing negotiations between Tokyo and Washington have not been made public, but people familiar with the talks  Japan has proposed some concessions such as sharp cuts in exceptional tariffs on beef and pork. While the proposals are likely to draw strong reactions from Japanese farmers, who in general fear an influx of cheaper overseas products, William Brooks, a U.S. expert on relations with Japan,  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe can get through the resistance. Brooks, adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University,  Abe government is trying to restructure agriculture as a growth industry and its position on TPP until now has been accepted by the public. \"I don\\'t think he has anything to worry about as long as he is popular,\" Brooks .',\n",
       " 'U.S. News: Drug Patents Pose a Major Hurdle to Pacific Trade Deal By William Mauldin 2 February 2015 The Wall Street Journal Disagreement over the international reach of drug patents has emerged as a significant challenge as the Obama administration tries to hatch a Pacific trade deal acceptable to U.S. companies, political factions in Congress and trading partners. The issue flared last week as half a dozen senators grilled U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman about his commitment to rules that would protect medicines called biologic drugs from imitation for up to 12 . U.S. trade negotiators met over the weekend with officials from 11 countries, including Japan, to work out rules for the drugs in a proposed trade bloc, the TransPacific Partnership, or TPP. Critics of President Barack Obama trade policy say defending drug makers from competition for  makes medicine unaffordable in some poorer countries and could even cost lives. The issue is part of a broad debate on intellectual property that pits more innovative economies against developing ones. \"This is one of the most difficult outstanding issues in the negotiations,\" Mr. Froman told the Senate hearing. Pharmaceuticals are a big part of the TPP talks, and an industry where U.S. officials see a clear advantage. For Japan, medicines are the largest import from the U.S. after aircraft, meat and medical equipment. Biologic drugs made from living cells, blood components and tissue as opposed to chemicals are expected to generate up to $200 billion in sales by next , according to IMS Health, a data provider. This month, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approving the first \"biosimilar\" drug in the U.S., a version of Amgen Inc. cancer drug Neupogen from Novartis AG Sandoz unit. The pharmaceutical industry wants makers of biologics to have 12  to exclusively market their drugs before competitors can offer biosimilar drugs in TPP countries, the same rule enshrined in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It also is significantly more than most TPP partners offer domestically but similar to Japan level of protection. \"If you don\\'t do that, your biologics companies won\\'t be able to compete,\" Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,  Friday at the American Enterprise Institute. It isn\\'t clear whether U.S. officials will be able to clinch a deal that includes 12 protection without compromises in other areas of the TPP, according to people following the talks. The pharmaceutical industry says drug companies need the promise of a big payout to invest $1 billion or so on creating the next biologic blockbuster.',\n",
       " 'Statistical revisions add shine to India growth James Crabtree in Mumbai 1 February 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) India attempts to catch up with China rate of economic expansion have received an unexpected boost from statistical revisions that dramatically raised estimates of the country gross domestic product growth during the past two . Interest in the relative performance of Asia two largest emerging economies has been stoked by forecasts suggesting India is on course to overtake its larger neighbour next , with the International Monetary Fund projecting India growth at 6.5 per cent in 2016 while China slows to 6.3 per cent. But the recent growth gap between the two nations now appears to have been smaller than previously estimated, after India main statistical body released revised estimates on Friday showing the economy growing by 6.9 per cent during the 2014 financial , up from the previous figure of 4.7 per cent. The new data show India recovering rapidly following its economic slowdown, and bring the country rate of expansion much closer to that of China, which grew by 7.4 per cent during the 2014 calendar , according to IMF data. India growth for the financial  ending in March 2013 was also revised from 4.7 per cent to 5.1 per cent in the changes announced by India Central Statistical Organisation. Economist Shilan Shah at consultants Capital Economics described the described the upward revisions as \"astounding\", but questioned the extent to which India had in fact performed \"far better\" than most economists had realised in the  prior to the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi last May. \"If true, this implies there is much less room for a substantial pickup in growth without stoking inflation,\" Mr Shah wrote in a note. \"But this picture of health is hard to square with numerous other indicators that point to increasing slack in the economy.\" The revisions followed changes in the way India statisticians gauge growth that were designed to bring the country into line with international norms, including a oneoff updating of the base  used for GDP calculations and improvements in survey techniques. Prior to the revisions, India had appeared to be making a gradual recovery from a prolonged slump under its previous government, during whose tenure growth rates almost halved having touched nearly 9 per cent in 2011. India economy expanded by 5.3 per cent during the third quarter of this financial , although this figure is also now likely to be revised, alongside data for the first two quarters, when India publishes its latest GDP figures on February 9. While oneoff revisions to historical data are unlikely to have an effect on future growth rates, the changes could provide a boost to Mr Modi by helping his government meet a tough target of cutting India fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of GDP by the end of March, analysts . \"These revisions should not make much difference to what happens next  in terms of growth,\"  Surjit Bhalla, an economist at New Delhibased Oxus Investments. \"The biggest implication is that the fiscal deficit target should now be more easily met, because the GDP base for that 4.1 per cent target will have changed.\" COMMENT',\n",
       " 'The perils of a strong US dollar By Edward Luce in America 2 February 2015 Financial Times First things first. We are not about to replay the 1930s. The world big economies are not deliberately indulging in \"beggar thy neighbour\" devaluations and protectionism is not poised for an ugly revival. As they say in the US: situation normal, all fouled up or words to that effect. Yet there are undertows we ignore at our risk. The US dollar is surging and export growth is slowing. The same applies to the widely forecast stampede of reshoring to the country, which is not really happening. Most US competitors are cutting interest rates and watching their currencies fall against the dollar. If these trends persist, and they will, US politics will react. A rising dollar is not the picnic it is made it out to be. Yet it is hard to see what will stop it. The gap between North America growth, which is \"solid\", in the words of Janet Yellen, US Fed chairman, and that of most other big economies is real. So, too, is the growing monetary divergence. US 10 bond yields are historically low at just 1.7 per cent. But these are juicy compared to Germany (0.3 per cent), Japan (0.25 per cent) and even the UK (1.3 per cent). Investors will keep buying the dollar. This will become more pronounced as the Fed moves towards its first rate rise in almost a decade. Most others are cutting theirs. In the past three weeks, Canada, India, and Singapore have all reduced their lending rates. Australia and Turkey are expected to follow suit. The European Central Bank and Denmark are moving into negative nominal territory. It is probably a matter of time before the euro reaches parity with the dollar. These are not Great Depressionstyle devaluations. The Europeans and others are stepping up quantitative easing to revive growth, not to undercut the US. But the effect is the same. The dangers are twofold. First, there is an increasingly strong effect on the corporate bottom line. Almost half of the revenues of US S&P 500 companies come from overseas, and an even higher share of net profits. The stronger the dollar, the weaker their earnings growth. In the last quarter of 2014, many big companies reported declining profits. Caterpillar fell by 25 per cent. Procter & Gamble forecasts zero growth in 2015 because of the strong dollar. Even Apple and Google warned of \"strong currency headwinds\". This helps explain why US equity markets dropped by 5 per cent in January, while the dollar rose. Second, the political backlash is growing. Last week, Republicans and Democrats pressed Mike Froman, the US chief trade negotiator, to include a currency manipulation clause in the Transpacific Partnership trade deal with Japan the focus. Though China is not part of the TPP, the remininbi was their real target. Mr Froman redirected their questions to Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, who insists a strong dollar is in America interests. Mr Lew mantra is formulaic, and arguably misleading. But as my colleague Alan Beattie has pointed out, currency shenanigans are in the eye of the beholder. One person devaluation is another monetary policy. Rules against it are impossible to enforce. Insisting on them would wreck chances of a Pacific trade deal. Yet, as exports stall and manufacturing jobs fail to return to the US, the political debate is likely to grow louder. Last month, Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, and Ed Balls, the UK shadow chancellor, came out with a report on inclusive prosperity at the Center for American Progress. It offers a clear set of policies to reverse the declining incomes of the western middle class. These include broadening employee ownership, improving parental leave,raising the minimum wage and stepping up vocational training. Its findings are seen as a blueprint for Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Astonishingly, given that Mr Summers has long opposed such clauses, it also recommends \"new trade agreements should explicitly include enforceable disciplines against currency manipulation\". With such cover, it is little wonder both left and right are clamouring for their inclusion. What, then, will become of the strong dollar? The upside is that Ms Yellen can afford to keep interest rates at zero for longer than expected. There is scant sign of wage growth and inflation is nowhere on the horizon. The stronger the dollar, the lower the cost of imports. Falling oil prices also help. By Europe standards, the US is grappling with a highclass problem. The bad news is that its recovery is based on the familiar model of rising consumption. In the last quarter of 2014, growth of 2.6 per cent was driven by household spending, rather than investment. American companies are actually cutting domestic outlays. Since rising US consumer spending is driven by cheap borrowing costs rather than growing middle class earnings, it is vulnerable to a turn in the interest rate cycle. Most Americans are still cautious about the strength of the recovery. With 30 mortgages available at less than 3 per cent, it is striking how few are buying homes. It is hard to believe more will do so when Ms Yellen finally acts. In one respect, Mr Lew is right. The strong dollar reflects America success. It may also be a case of being careful what you wish for. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'US trade chief moves within reach of big TransPacific prize By Shawn Donnan, World Trade Editor 3 February 2015 Financial Times Despite obstacles, Froman is resolute that agreement will protect workers If all goes to plan in the coming months, Mike Froman, US trade representative, is set to land arguably the biggest prize in the country recent economic history. The 12country TransPacific Partnership, now nearing conclusion almost seven  after the US joined negotiations, is daunting in size and scope and dwarfs the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico that went into effect two decades ago. Some 40 per cent of global output will be covered by the TPP, including two of the top three economies in the world (the US and Japan). It will significantly lower tariffs and other trade barriers around the Pacific Rim on everything from rice and steaks to cars and chemicals. It will contain enforceable standards on labour and the environment. It will set benchmarks by delineating rules for stateowned enterprises in the developing world and the digital economy. It will leave rivals in Beijing and Brussels salivating. Yet the TPP is being derided by many inside President Barack Obama Democratic party and by the unions it has relied on for its base. At a time when Mr Obama is putting a new \"middleclass economics\" and the fight against inequality at the centre of his agenda, his push for new trade agreements causes many on his side of politics to squirm. Such are the politics of trade in the US. The consensus among many Democrats with regard to trade agreements and globalisation is that they have not been kind to the middle class, having contributed to highpaying manufacturing jobs being shipped offshore and wages stagnating. Economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have raised doubts about TPP. Even as she has made friendly noises on trade, Nancy Pelosi, the powerful Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, has been blunt about the administration challenge. \"The burden is on [the White House] to demonstrate that this is good for American pay cheques,\" she  last week. But, sitting before the brick hearth in his office, a spitting distance from the White House, Mr Froman is resolute. \"We\\'re doing this to protect American jobs and American workers,\" he tells the Financial Times in an interview. The TPP is, he argues, a way to open up more markets for US goods and services in fastgrowing Asia and to create highpaying jobs at home. It is also a way to level the playing field for American workers by including stronger labour and environmental standards that will be enforceable via trade sanctions. And, with Canada and Mexico included, to deliver on President Obama longago campaign promise to renegotiate Nafta, something the progressive wing of the Democratic party has long sought. \"There are a lot of people who raise very legitimate concerns about the impact of globalisation on patterns of production, on jobs, on wages. But I think it also  not to conflate globalisation with trade agreements,\" Mr Froman says. \"Globalisation is a force. It exists. The question is whether we can use trade agreements to shape it, or whether we want to just sit and be shaped by it.\" The US, he says, needs to be at the forefront of setting global rules of commerce. Countries like China are engaged in their own rival bids to create regional blocs that exclude the US and do not include the sort of rules the US is pursuing on labour, intellectual property or the internet. Ceding ground to such rivals \"has got to be worse for American workers and the American middle class than even the status quo\". Negotiators from the US, Japan and the 10 other countries in the TPP are involved in almost constant discussions. Obstacles clearly remain and negotiations are tough. But a TPP deal is \"a small number of months\" away, Mr Froman forecast during a Senate hearing last week. The US has told its partners within the TPP that it wants to complete negotiations before the summer so that an agreement can be put to Congress by the end of 2015 and before the 2016 presidential campaign heats up. Amid pitched partisan battles on other issues, ly the new Republican leadership in Congress says it wants to give Mr Obama the \"fasttrack\" authority he needs to close the TPP and, eventually, a parallel negotiation with the EU. Business groups, Republicans and the administration all believe a healthy majority in Congress will back a vote on what is formally called Trade Promotion Authority. Asked whether he expects such a vote to succeed, Mr Froman answers: \"Yes\". The consensus in the US is that Congress is likely to vote on fasttrack authority within twothree months and that a TPP deal will be closed shortly thereafter. Mr Froman big moment the US big trade moment may well be not very far away.',\n",

The objective of this measure is to address quickly the negative balance of payments of Ukraine, a significant reduction of monetary reserves of the National Bank and to restore equilibrium of the balance of payments. In 2014 balance of payments of Ukraine was affected by a combination of extremely adverse factors such as increased barriers to Ukrainian export to traditional markets, unfavorable market prices for major export goods, antiterrorist operation in eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, dramatic devaluation of the national currency, destabilization of the banking system and outflow of investments. Following 11 months of 2014 the balance of payments has been formed as negative at more than $11.046 billion. As of January 9, 2015 the international reserves amounted to $ 7.34 billion which provided funding of future imports for 1.4 months.',\n",
       " 'India Cites Multitude of Errors in WTO Ruling on U.S. Poultry Ban By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 3, 2015 Feb. 2 — A World Trade Organization dispute settlement panel committed a long list of legal errors and misinterpretations in its decision against India ban on U.S. poultry imports, India  in its appellate filing. The panel Oct. 14 report  India ban violated the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement because it was not based on the relevant international standards, among other failings. India alleged that the WTO panel inaccurately interpreted the India policies used to prevent harm to its citizens and did not rule objectively in other matters of the dispute. U.S. poultry and egg producers have long argued that there was poor scientific basis for India to prohibit exports of their products and called the ban “thinlyveiled protectionism” (199 WTO, 10/15/14). Annual U.S. poultry exports to India could surpass $300 million if the trade barriers were eliminated, according to industry estimates. Article 2.2 India appeal  the panel ruled incorrectly in its determination that India avian influenza (AI) measures were inconsistent with Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement. Section 2.2 of the agreement requires members to “ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.” The panel agreed with the U.S. argument that India measures did not adequately conform to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Code, the relevant international standard for SPS determinations in this case. The panel further  India AI measures were applied “beyond the extent necessary to protect human and animal life or health.” India countered that the panel erred in its interpretation because it: made an “incorrect interpretation” Article 2.2 the SPS Agreement; disregarded India evidence that its AI measures are based on scientific principles and sufficient scientific evidence; failed to take into account the difference between highly pathogenic avian influenza and low pathogenic avian influenza; and disregarded India argument that its AI measures are based on a risk assessment that takes into account relevant international organizations. Articles 3.1 and 3.2 India  the panel erred in its finding that India AI measures did not conform to international standards and urged the panel to reverse its decision that the measures were inconsistent with articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the SPS Agreement. The panel decision  India was “not entitled to benefit from the presumption of consistency of its AI measures with the other relevant provisions of the SPS Agreement and of the GATT 1994 because India AI measures do not ‘conform to’ the [OIE] Terrestrial Code.” India  the panel incorrectly disregarded India “arguments and evidence” and failed to interpret the OIE Code “in accordance with the customary principles of international law as codified in Article 31 and Article 32” of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Further, the panel arrived at a conclusion “which is not supported by the evidence available and thus is not an objective assessment of matter,” India appeal claimed. Articles 6.1 and 6.2 India appeal  the dispute panel erred in finding that India AI measures failed to separate diseasefree areas and areas of low disease prevalence, thus violating sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the SPS Agreement. India countered that the first sentence of the SPS Agreement only requires recognition of the concepts of pest or diseasefree areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence and not of implementation of these concepts. India added that the panel failed to recognize that Section 6.1 of the SPS agreement requires an importing country to adapt its sanitary measures to the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of the area of the exporting country “only upon receiving a formal proposal.” “Since the United States has not made any formal proposal pursuant to Article 6.3 of the SPS Agreement, India has not acted inconsistently with Article 6.1,” the appeal . Other Objections India objected to several rulings on claims that it  were not argued by the U.S. in the dispute. India sought to reverse the panel findings that were based on individual expert testimony that India  exceeded the scope of the OIE code. India further urged the panel to reverse findings that its AI measures were more trade restrictive than required to achieve an appropriate level of protection. Typically, the WTO Appellate Body has 90 days to issue a report following an appeal.',\n",
       " \"Dominican Republic Criticizes U.K. Tobacco Plain Packaging Proposal By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 3, 2015 Feb. 2 — The Dominican Republic protested the United Kingdom plans to introduce plain packaging of tobacco product regulations during a recent World Trade Organization meeting. Trade officials from the Dominican Republic  they are “deeply concerned” that the U.K. is considering a proposal that requires the elimination of trademarks and geographical indications on tobacco packaging as part of its effort to reduce smoking, according to a statement that was made public on Feb. 2. The Dominican Republic and four other WTO members—Ukraine Honduras, Indonesia and Cuba—are already embroiled in an ongoing legal challenge against Australia 2011 Tobacco Plain Packaging Act and are concerned that more countries will seek to restrict how tobacco manufacturers label cigarette packaging. The dispute is likely to be a topic of discussion at the next meeting of the Council for TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) scheduled for Feb. 2425 in Geneva. ‘Destroys' IP Rights Last month, the U.K. government proposed new rules to require tobacco manufacturers to sell cigarettes and handrolling tobacco in packages with standardized colors, text and health warnings (15 WTO, 1/23/15). Opponents of such laws have argued that they impose unfair restrictions on the use of trademarks, geographical indications and other markings in violation of the TRIPS agreement, the agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Specifically, the plain packaging rules exceed the goals of protecting public health and could make it easier and cheaper for counterfeiters to sell cigarettes under false labels, the countries have . The U.K.’s plain packaging tobacco product proposal “destroys the intellectual property rights of our producers and undermines their competitive opportunities, without providing any concrete advantage for public health,” the Dominican Republic  in a statement that first circulated Jan. 21. Awaiting 2016 Decision The WTO Dispute Settlement Body is not expected to issue its final decision on the complaint against Australia tobacco labeling rules until the first half of 2016. In the meantime, the five opponents of plain packaging rules have sought to persuade other WTO members not to seek new, neutral tobacco packaging rules while a resolution to the dispute is pending. New Zealand is considering tobacco labeling legislation that reflects the rules implemented by Australia, as are Ireland and France. The U.S. is not directly involved in the complaint but has reserved its right to participate as a third party.\",\n",
       " 'Trips extension for pharma sector Wasi Ahmed 3 February 2015 The Financial Express (Bangladesh) Bangladesh, Feb. 3 The country pharmaceutical sector, despite its commendable growth, is fraught with the big question whether it would get period by way of an additional transitional period until the WTO TradeRelated Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement comes into full force. Although the general transitional period for application of the TRIPS agreement in the case of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) has been extended until 2021, the same will not apply to the pharmaceutical sector. This has been regarded by observers as a lost opportunity, as reviving the issue in favour of extension in future negotiations may not be easy, if not extremely difficult. Currently, under the WTOTRIPS agreement, Bangladesh is allowed to manufacture and export any kind of generic drugs patented or not which will not be the case in the absence of a further extension. One of the difficulties in gaining further flexibility for the pharma sector is that not many countries among the LDCs have been able to develop this sector to a level where expiry of the TRIPS transition period means much to them. The case with Bangladesh is altogether different; the country with its considerably developed pharmaceutical sector is but a loner in the league of the LDCs. This, in other words, means that Bangladesh may find it difficult to team up with the rest of the LDCs in collectively moving the issue at the WTO, as the benefits from extension will be more in favour of Bangladesh than any of its LDC partners. It may be recalled that the Council for TRIPS adopted in June 2013 a resolution at the WTO that allows LDCs an eight extension on exemption from implementing intellectual property (IP) rules under the TRIPS Agreement. But the exemption excludes pharmaceutical products. The LDCs proposed for an extension that would enable them to remain exempt from implementing nearly all provisions of the TRIPS agreement, including for pharmaceutical products, until the time they are classified as \"leastdeveloped.\" Following the refusal of the USA and European Union to accept the LDCs\\' request for such comprehensive extension, the LDCs will now have to go back to the WTO ahead of the 2016 deadline to renegotiate an extension. In the face of opposition, led by the USA and the European Union (EU), a compromise was, however, developed. The members of the World Trade Organisation agreed to extend the deadline by eight more , until July 1, 2021 allowing the LDCs to access more affordable medical technologies such as diagnostics and medical devices for a few more . However, this compromise does not address the looming 2016 deadline of a second transition period, which exempts the LDCs from implementing stringent IP regulations for pharmaceutical products. Exclusion of pharmaceutical products from the general extension is viewed by many as not only harsh but unbecoming also. Experts opine that given the crucial importance of pharmaceutical products, the LDCs should insist on an unconditional extension. \"It is clear that wealthy countries are ignoring the huge health challenges LDCs face by refusing to grant them a longer and more complete extension\" says Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders (MSF), a humanitarian medical organisation. MSF reports that it is noticing ever more unaffordable and inaccessible medicines in developing countries that have implemented the TRIPS Agreement and for the LDCs to be forced to do the same by 2016 would be disastrous. The case of the WTO LDC Members for an extension of the time period within which they must become compliant with the TRIPS Agreement covers all forms of intellectual property protection under TRIPS. Even though it is true that some LDCs have signed other treaties that might impose some IP obligations (e.g., the Paris Convention on Industrial Property or the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works), freeing themselves from the broader and stronger spectrum of IP mandates in TRIPS will enable their access to broad classes of essential public goods, including all medical commodities, educational and informational resources, agricultural resources, and green/climate control technologies. The LDCs thus must retain the right to rollback implementation, application and enforcement of patent and data rights with respect to pharmaceutical products and the right to seek further extensions of the 2016 transition period. Some observers wonder whether the move for further extension would cover the previous extension granted to LDCs in 2002 pursuant to Paragraph 7 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health covering \"pharmaceutical products.\" In technical terms, the 2002 extension applied with respect to Section 5 and 7 of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement, namely the sections dealing with patents and data protection. The term \"pharmaceutical products\" is not defined in the 2002 LDC Extension (which runs until January 01, 2016), but whatever its interpretation, its application is not as broad as all the medical technologies and commodities that would be covered under the general LDC extension request. At home, the ministry of commerce is reportedly preparing for the negotiation on extension. Within this month (February), the ministry is to submit a proposal to the LDC group committee currently headed by Uganda. A good deal depends on how good or worse Bangladesh fairs in taking the LDC group with it in the crucial negotiation ahead.',\n",

Korea faces possible oversupply of rice on record output, imports SEJONG, Feb. 2 (Yonhap) South Korea may face an oversupply of rice this  as its output reached a five high while rice consumption continues to shrink, government officials  Monday. According to the officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the country selfsufficiency rate for rice is expected to reach 97 percent in 2015. The country overall output of rice inched up 0.3 percent on to some 4.24 million tons in 2014. South Korea is also required to import at least 408,700 tons of rice every  under a special agreement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), which had allowed the country to postpone opening its rice market over the past 20 . South Korea liberalized its rice market through tarrification at the start of this . The oversupply problem will likely be further accelerated by a drop in the country rice consumption, the ministry officials noted. In 2014, the country annual intake of rice per person dipped 3.1 percent on to a record low of 65.1 kilograms. The per capita consumption is again expected to shrink this , continuing its steady decline over the past 40 odd  since 1970 when it hit a record high of 136.4 kg, officials .',\n",

The proposal in the fiscal  2016 budget brings back a plan first suggested in 2012, which the administration  at the time could save $3 billion over 10 . It comes at a hectic time, with U.S. negotiators hoping to complete work on the 12nation TransPacific Partnership within months and lawmakers expected soon to consider legislation to streamline the passage of such deals through Congress. The United States is also negotiating a trade pact with Europe. The revamp would put USTR, the ExportImport Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Small Business Administration, parts of the Department of Commerce and rural business programs at several agencies under the same roof. \"By bringing together the core tools to expand trade and investment, grow small businesses, and support innovation, the new department would coordinate these resources to maximize the benefits for businesses and the economy,\" the budget proposal . Commerce Deputy Secretary Bruce Andrews  there was no updated estimate for potential savings. In the past, some lawmakers voiced cautious support for the streamlining plan while others worried it would create a bureaucratic behemoth that would compromise the independence of some of the trade bodies.

       " 'Swiss Economy Braces for Franc’s Impact BY NEIL MAC LUCAS 3 Feb 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe ZURICH—When the Swiss National Bank tied the Swiss franc to the euro 3 ½  ago, it feared a surging franc would tip the economy into recession. With the SNB now having lifted the cap, the economy is back to square one: a stronger franc again threatens to snuff out growth in one of Europe’s few bright spots. Swiss watchmakers are among those companies whose exports could fall because of the central bank’s decision to let the franc float freely against the euro. Switzerland’s export sector, equal to about 70% of gross domestic product, is most at risk. Swiss goods could be priced out of the eurozone, the country’s biggest market, threatening both Swiss corporate profits and jobs. Zurichbased private bank Julius Baer Group AG  on Monday that it would cut about 200 jobs to “mitigate” the effects of the strong franc, in the first response among Switzerland’s outsize banking industry. Like other Swiss private banks, Julius Baer reports most of its costs in francs, but derives most of its income in euros or dollars. The country’s two leading economic research institutes—KOF and BAK Basel— now predict that the economy will enter a recession before the end of this . “The first sector likely to be hit by the shock rise in the franc will be exports, which could drop by around 1.3% this ,”  BAK Basel economist Alexis Bill Körber. Switzerland’s three largest banks still expect the economy to avoid a recession, commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of declines in gross domestic product. But they have cut their forecasts to an anemic growth rate of between 0.5% and 0.8% this . That compares with expected growth of 1.4% in 2014. Neither the SNB or the government has issued new economic forecasts since the central bank’s surprising decision to lift the cap on Jan. 15, which sent the franc rocketing against the euro and roiled global markets. The bank defended its decision, saying the upturn in the U.S. economy had boosted the dollar against the euro and the franc, making the franc’s cap untenable. The franc on Monday traded at 1.0502 against the euro, compared with around 1.2008 the day the cap was lifted. The Swiss government, which supported the SNB’s decision, has limited its response so far to urging firms to raise their productivity. The head of the country’s economics department, Johann Schneider Ammann, recently  that pay cuts may also be necessary. Mr. SchneiderAmmann has held two meetings with business, industry, tradeunion and publicservice bodies to discuss responses to the SNB’s move. Swiss officials have for now ruled out an economic stimulus plan. They have, however, agreed to a program to compensate workers placed on shorter hours because of the strengthened franc. The Swiss unemployment rate of 3.4%, remains low by European standards; the eurozone jobless rate hit 11.4% in December. But economists expect Swiss companies to push the country’s unemployment rate higher in coming months. Swiss industrial lobby group Swissmem has warned that the strong franc could put around 20% of its members out of business. In addition to banks, retailers are likely to be hard hit by the stronger franc. That is particularly true for those near Switzerland’s border with Germany, France and Italy, a relatively short drive away for shoppers seeking to take advantage of the stronger franc. Swiss retailer Migros Group expects sales to decline at its stores along the border, according to comments made to Swiss media by Chief Executive Herbert Bolliger. The difference in staff costs between Migros and its German competitors is “enormous,” Mr. Bolliger , adding that a Migros cashier in Switzerland earns around 4,000 francs (€ 3,800) a month compared with the € 1,600 a month made by a cashier in Germany. In September 2011, when the SNB first imposed its cap on the franc, the central bank cited “an acute threat to the economy,” and the risk of a “deflationary development.” Those two threats remain, analysts say. The threat of falling prices is actually more acute now than it was 3 ½  ago, they say, as the decline in oil prices has put further pressure on Swiss prices. The SNB is forecasting Swiss prices will drop an average 0.1% this  because of lower oil prices and the stronger franc. “A technical recession in Switzerland cannot be excluded,”  Cornelia Luchsinger, a senior economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank.',\n",
       " 'Switzerland remains offshore wealth magnet By Matthew Allen Feb 2, 2015 14:16 Swissinfo.ch The world’s wealthy still consider Switzerland the best place to park their riches despite tax evasion scandals ending banking secrecy. Swiss banks held $2 trillion (CHF1.87 trillion) of offshore wealth last , according to financial consulting firm Deloitte. This confirms Switzerland as being ahead of Britain ($1.7 trillion) and the United States ($1.4 trillion) as the world’s leading destination of crossborder wealth management. However, smaller Asian centres, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, continue to grow at a faster rate than Switzerland despite remaining some distance away in terms of absolute size of assets under management (AUM). “Switzerland remains the world’s largest centre, but other locations are catching up rapidly – especially Hong Kong [142% AUM growth], the US [28%] and Singapore [25%],” Daniel Kobler, Deloitte Switzerland’s head of Banking Strategy Consulting,  in the report. Kobler’s comments echoed those being made by various observers – most notably WealthInsight in 2013 – in the past two  that warned of Asian competitors catching up with, and overtaking, Switzerland in the next few . Behind Switzerland’s headline AUM statistic lurks further problems for the Swiss private banking sector. The majority of the 14% AUM growth in Switzerland since 2008 has been realised by rebounding markets swelling the size of assets that took such a hit during the financial crisis. This masks the fact that Switzerland lost 7% of its AUM in the same period as a result of clients withdrawing their money in the face of a growing global crackdown on tax evasion. This has put a serious dampener on overall growth of the Swiss wealth management business. Declining profitability The Deloitte study, however, reveals that Switzerland was a long way from being the worst affected jurisdiction in this respect. Only Hong Kong and Singapore saw more wealth deposits than withdrawals between 2008 and 2014. While Switzerland lost $135 million through this process, Britain saw $300 million disappear (21% of total AUM) while a staggering $1.3 trillion of offshore wealth drained away from Panama and the Caribbean (a loss of threequarters of crossborder AUM). The latter group of jurisdictions suffered so badly due to their close proximity to the US, while the British government has made some efforts to clean up the image of its numerous tax havens, such as Jersey and more far flung protectorates. Another serious issue facing Swiss banks is their declining profitability. Deloitte calculates that profit margins in Switzerland have shrunk from 40 basis points in 2008 to 24 bps last . This decline has been largely caused by tax evasion legal costs, implementing new regulations and other expenses, such as new technology to keep up with the industry’s digitisation drive. Income has also taken a hit as clients eschew risk and demand more for the fees that banks charge them. “Swiss providers face some challenges on both revenue realisation and sustainable cost management,”  Kobler. Higher costs, lower revenues The effects of higher costs and lower revenues has not been lost on the sector. The past few  have been punctuated by several reports highlighting the problem, particularly for smaller banks that lack the financial clout to redirect their resources to other locations. The larger banks have been busy shutting down operations in less profitable countries and expanding in growth regions. This includes Asia (where UBS is the largest wealth manager) and also mainland Europe where some Swiss banks have been building up offices to capture some of the offshore wealth that is leaving Switzerland. A handful of traditional private banks, such as Pictet and Lombard Odier, have abandoned their unlimited liability models to find an extra source of funding as stocklisted banks. But the muchhyped wave of consolidation in the Swiss private banking sector has so far only really materialised in the dwindling number of foreign banks in Switzerland. The predicted fall of many smaller local banks has not yet come to pass. The industry is also bracing itself for the negative effects of the strong franc that soared 20% against the euro when the Swiss National Bank abandoned its euro peg on January 15. Julius Baer announced on Monday that it needed to save CHF100 million by shedding some 200 jobs as a result of the strong franc pressures on margins. END ________________________________',\n",

Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland  they “very much appreciate the improvements” Ukraine made in its second revised offer to join the GPA, according to a joint Feb. 3 statement. Ukraine second revised offer circulated among members on Oct. 28 and has not yet been made public. Members  they are optimistic that Ukraine accession could be concluded sometime in the first half of 2015, according to the Government Procurement Committee latest report. Members of the WTO Government Procurement Committee likely will discuss Ukraine latest bid at their next meeting scheduled for Feb. 11. Addressing Concerns Ukraine latest proposal sought to counter members' concerns about thresholds, general notes and some other aspects of the country first revised offer. GPA members had asked Ukraine to provide indicative lists specifying all central government, subcentral government and other entities that will be covered under the agreement (86 WTO, 5/3/13). Members asked Ukraine to set a threshold for goods and services procurement by other entities at 400,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) ($606,000). Members further asked Ukraine to clarify whether it intends that all services procured by listed entities will be subject to GPA requirements and asked Ukraine to justify or remove most of the requested exceptions for specific types of procurement. Ukraine has since notified GPA members that it brought into force a new public procurement law that takes into account the rules of relevant European Union directives and the GPA requirements. Ukraine  it expects the legislation will enable it to lower its proposed thresholds and to eliminate some of its general notes. Feb. 11 Meeting The goal of the GPA is to open up government procurement deals to international trade and competition, while ensuring transparency and a commitment to good governance. Last , members revised the GPA to modernize certain aspects of its rules and to expand its scope. The GPA is a “plurilateral” agreement, meaning that the market access concessions are only granted to suppliers in those countries that have acceded to the agreement. There are 43 parties to the GPA, including: Armenia; Canada; the European Union, with its 28 member states; Hong Kong; Iceland; Israel; Japan; Korea; Liechtenstein; the Netherlands with respect to Aruba; Norway; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan and the U.S. Ukraine is among 10 WTO members negotiating accession to the GPA.

       " 'China high agricultural stockpiles complicate reform efforts Lucy Hornby 3 February 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Chinese stockpiles of agricultural commodities have hit historically high levels, according to the country most senior agricultural adviser. He  the stockpiles were complicating efforts to phase out state buying policy without causing a steep fall in prices. Government buying of cotton, wheat, corn, soya, sugar and rice at above market prices has encouraged Chinese farmers to grow strategic crops. But this has led to bloated warehouses, smuggling and an increase in cheaper imports from overseas producers. This has led to the ballooning of Chinese stockpiles. For example, China has amassed 60 per cent of the world cotton stocks, prompting an announcement by Beijing last  that it would release its cotton holdings. The bigger Chinese stockpiles grow, the harder it is for Beijing to extricate itself without dumping the glut into the market. The move will reverberate into the international markets as China has become a large buyer of agricultural commodities. Chinese policy makers fear that releasing its inventories would depress prices and push farmers towards more lucrative cash crops, ultimately increasing China reliance on imports. China grain harvest has risen every  for more than a decade, as high prices encouraged farmers to grow strategic crops. However, costs have remained high and the agricultural sector is uncompetitive compared with other countries. \"Since last  we haven\\'t raised the minimum price [for wheat and rice]: that sends a signal to the farmers,\"  Chen Xiwen, director of the office of the central rural work leading group, at his annual press conference to explain rural policies for the . By capping the stateset minimum purchase price as costs continue to rise, the government hopes that it will come into line with market prices, Mr Chen . He noted, however, that the steep drop in oil prices means growers should still have comfortable margins this . \"We just want it to stabilise, that all.\" A pilot policy to replace minimum prices with direct payments to cotton and soyabean growers who would then sell at market prices is still being evaluated, Mr Chen . Depending on its success, the decision can then be made whether it can be extended to other crops. Beijing currently makes payments of roughly Rmb600/tonne ($96) to cotton farmers in ethnically divided Xinjiang, where much of the crop is produced by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary group of Han Chinese settlers along the Central Asian border. Cotton farmers in central China get less. The amount is supposed to \"close the gap\" between market prices of about Rmb13,600/tonne and the state purchase price of Rmb9,800/tonne. The government has also asked cotton growers to reduce acreage this  to help alleviate the surplus, Mr Chen . Among the inadvertent consequences of the guaranteed prices paid by the state reserves system is that traders, including stateowned firms, can import rice and other commodities bought at lower prices overseas and then use the imports as collateral for other loans, which can then be ploughed into China shadow banking sector.',\n",
       " 'Indonesian government proposes jump in biodiesel subsidies JAKARTA, Feb 3 (Reuters) Indonesia government plans to introduce a more than threefold increase in its biodiesel subsidies, an energy ministry official  on Tuesday, a move aimed at protecting Indonesia fledgling biofuel industry against lower crude prices. An increase in subsidies could potentially boost demand for palm oil, although the government plan still has to get parliamentary backing before becoming law. If passed, such a law would be a timely fillip for crude palm oil prices that have lost more than a quarter from their 2014 peak in March last . Southeast Asia biggest economy and the top producer of tropical palm oil introduced an ambitious regulation in August 2013 to boost the use of palmbased biodiesel and cut its oil import bill. Logistical and infrastructure problems have hindered the implementation of the regulation, and global crude oil prices that have tumbled up to 60 percent since last June are a further impediment to biofuel development. President Joko Widodo government has proposed an increase of the biodiesel subsidy to 5,000 rupiah (40 U.S. cents) per litre, from 1,500 rupiah per litre presently,  Dadan Kusdiana, director of bioenergy at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. \"We give biodiesel subsidies to show government support for the development of renewable energy,\" Kusdiana . \"We expect consumption of renewable energy to increase.\" On Jan. 1, Widodo government stopped subsidising gasoline prices altogether and moved to setting prices according to global oil markets creating a fiscal windfall for social services and infrastructure projects. Indonesia biodiesel demand was about 1.7 million tonnes last  and that set to climb to 2.8 million tonnes in 2015, according to industry estimates.

       " 'Egypt cotton growers hanging by a thread after subsidy withdrawal; Farming By Heba Saleh in Cairo 4 February 2015 Financial Times A byword for luxury, Egyptian cotton is famed the world over. In Egypt itself, the socalled \"white gold\" has been celebrated in songs and films, funded family weddings and allowed the settling of debts in the fertile Nile Delta. But the former mainstay of Egypt economy, and the source of many a trader fortune, has been declining for  owing to changing government policy, a shrinking domestic market and the vagaries of international cotton prices. Now a decision by the Egyptian government to end a subsidy to cotton growers introduced only last  has angered farmers and prompted warnings they may stop growing the crop. \"After the statement by the minister [last month], farmers will choose to plant anything else,\"  Mohamed Farag, who heads the Independent Farmers Union. \"I think there will be less cotton planted and the price will go up next season.\" The subsidy was worth about $200 per feddan, an area slightly larger than an acre, and the government hopes its abolition will encourage farmers not to grow the crop unless they have a contract for it. But for Egypt poorlyorganised farmers, who have little negotiating power, the subsidy was a valuable incentive to grow cotton. Egyptian cotton is rivalled only by American Pima. It is marked by its long and extralong staples or fibres that can be spun into fine yarns and used to weave luxury fabrics. The US and Egypt dominate the niche market for superior cottons, each with a market share of 40 per cent. Superior varieties account for 90 per cent of the cotton grown in Egypt. The remaining 10 per cent is medium staple. Even before the subsidy was abolished, production and exports were falling. According to US Department of Agriculture figures, Egypt exported 221,000 tonnes of cotton in 2006. Last  exports were only 50,000 tonnes, according to Mefreh al Beltagui, head of Alcotexa, the exporters\\' association. About 50 per cent of Egypt crop is exported, with the remainder used in domestic production. \"The area under cultivation is shrinking because the crop is less profitable to farmers than alternatives,\"  Mr al Beltagui. \"All cottonproducing countries, even the US, operate some form of subsid y.\" Domestic demand for highend Egyptian cotton is low,  Adel ElBeltagy, agriculture minister, as he announced the end of the subsidy. The local textile industry relies on imports of cheaper short and medium staple varieties, which are more suited to the production of Tshirts and denim that form the bulk of Egypt garment output. A surplus of highend cotton in 2013 meant that last  the government also had to subsidise spinning and weaving companies many of them cashstrapped publicsector buyers in order to offload unsold stocks. According to farmers and exporters, last  surplus was because foreign buyers rejected some of the harvest as it had been mixed with lowergrade varieties. But the government insists that subsidies are not the way forward for growers, and that they should instead negotiate prices in advance with buyers. \"The shape of the industry has changed,\"  Ali Ismail, an agriculture ministry official. \"Those who want cotton for export should pay a decent price for it. We have 260 companies that work in cotton, and when the crops come out they put pressure on farmers [to depress the price]. We want them to agree with the growers in advance.\" But Mr Beltagui, of the exporters\\' association,  it was impossible for his members to offer farmers an agreed price in advance because there is no futures market in longstaple cotton. \"It could prove damaging to the farmer or the seller,\" he . \"If the market price ends up being higher than that agreed, the farmer will pull out from the sale, if it is lower, the buyer will disappear.\" He wants the government to offer farmers a subsidy if prices fall below an agreed threshold. Experts argue that the crop domestic woes should not detract from the fact that highquality cotton still has an international market. \"I think there will always be room for Egyptian cotton imports, even in China and India, which are also cottonexporting countries,\"  Andrei Guitchounts, director of trade analysis at the International Cotton Advisory Committee, a USbased association. \"If Egyptian production doubles, it will still be possible for the international market to absorb it,\" he .',\n",

       " 'ATMA urges govt to raise import duty on tyre to 20% George Joseph 3 February 2015 Business Standard Tyre industry has urged the government to increase the customs duty on Tyres from basic rate of 10 per cent at present to 20 per cent and putting imports of tyres under negative list in all trade agreements. The industry has asked for increasing import duties on tyres to bring them at a par with natural rubber, the principal raw material so as to provide a levelplaying field to the domestic manufacturing. In its prebudget submission, Automotive Tyre Manufacturers\\' Association (ATMA) has stated that the import duty on natural rubber (NR) currently is 20 per cent while tyres can be imported at a rate of 5 per cent or even nil rate of duty under various Trade Agreements. It  that under SAFTA, tyres can be brought in at 5 per cent duty from Pakistan and Sri Lanka. For other SAFTA countries there is nil duty. \"For successful implementation of Make in India campaign and to promote domestic manufacturing, it is  that import of finished products attract duties at least as much, if not more, than what is levied on raw materials\",  Dr Raghupati Singhania, Chairman, ATMA. Although tyres can be imported into India at preferential/ concessional duties under various trade agreements, the corresponding concessional duties for NR do not exist since NR falls in the negative list across most trade agreements. Tyre is perhaps the only finished product on which \\'duty inversion\\' not only continues but has actually aggravated in recent . This needs to be addressed and corrected on priority, states ATMA. In line with the capacity creation in the auto sector, the tyre sector has added/expanded capacity pan India. Recent investments by Tyre Industry have been to the tune of over Rs. 26,000 crore in green field projects as also major expansions. However, low import tariffs in India have encouraged large and growing volume of tyre imports, despite adequate domestic capacity already in place. For instance, in case of Truck & Bus radial tyres (TBR), for which new capacities have come up, imported tyres have come to account for an estimated 20 per cent of the total domestic market. Quoting data from International Trade Advisory Services (ITAS), ATMA states more than 60 per cent of TBR import is taking place from China at an average unit value of $106 which is lower than raw material price. This is causing huge injury to the domestic tyre manufacturers. Hence, based on compelling need and circumstances, the Government of India can increase the customs duty on tyres without any corresponding action / explanation to WTO. Further, ATMA has stated that duties on raw materials where domestic production falls short of domestic consumption need to be reduced as imports are inevitable to meet the domestic industry requirements. Domestic production of  raw materials such as Nylon Tyre Cord Fabric, Rubber Chemicals, Steel Tyre Cord, Polyester Tyre Cord and Polybutadine Rubber (PBR) falls short of domestic consumption by 46%, 27%, 55%, 66% and 49% respectively. Similarly, Butyl Rubber, EPDM and Styrene Butadiene Rubber (Tyre Grades) have no domestic production and imports are the only source. ATMA has asked for full exemption from customs duty on these raw materials. Hefty import duties on raw materials where India has a shortfall in production or have no domestic production at all are affecting the cost competitiveness of India industry, states ATMA.',\n",

       " 'Obama tells Democrats no currency in TPP By Doug Palmer | 2/2/15 6:22 PM EST POLITICO President Barack Obama told lawmakers at the House Democrats’ retreat in Philadelphia last week not to expect rules against currency manipulation in a massive AsiaPacific free trade agreement, two sources familiar with the discussion have told POLITICO. Obama raised the issue without prompting, one of the sources . He told members it was not possible to address currency concerns in the TransPacific Partnership agreement, but the administration would continue to use other tools to press countries to move toward marketdetermined exchange rates. The president’s statement came just a few days after U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman acknowledged to lawmakers that the United States has not pressed for currency provisions in the 12country TPP pact despite widespread support in Congress for such a provision. At backtoback hearings with the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees, Froman outlined steps the administration has taken to push China and other countries on the currency issue but referred additional questions to U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, whose department has jurisdiction over the matter. Lawmakers will have that chance when Lew testifies before Ways and Means on Tuesday and Finance on Thursday on the administration’s fiscal 2016 budget request. Reached for comment, a Treasury representative  ensuring that U.S. workers and businesses can compete on a level playing field is a top priority for the administration, and the department is engaging Congress and other interested parties on how best to achieve that policy objective — including in multilateral and bilateral settings. “We have secured commitments from the G20 member countries to move more rapidly to a more marketdetermined exchange rates, avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments, refrain from competitive exchange rate devaluations, and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes,” the representative . “The Treasury Department remains focused on making more progress.” A White House spokesperson emphasized Obama’s personal attention to the issue over the  and his interest in working with Congress on their concerns. “The President has long shared the concerns of many members of Congress about currency or foreign exchange misalignment,” the spokesperson . “He has made clear that it is inappropriate for any country to try and grow its exports based on a persistently undervalued exchange rate and his Administration is working to address the issue directly with our international partners in bilateral and multilateral settings. “As discussion continues on Capitol Hill regarding trade legislation, the President has directed the Treasury Department to engage with Congress on the most effective tools to address unfair currency practices.” In 2013, 60 senators and 230 House members signed letters urging Obama to include strong and enforceable disciplines against currency manipulation in future trade agreements, including the TPP. Without such rules, countries could drive down the value of the currency to give their export companies an unfair price advantage and to protect their domestic producers by increasing the cost of imports, the lawmakers . The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Obama’s remarks. But in his testimony to Congress last week, Froman  it has been “a top priority” of Obama and the administration to prod other countries, particularly China, toward marketdetermined exchange rates. As a result of that pressure, Froman  the Chinese yuan has risen about 15 percent in real terms against the dollar since June 2010. “That’s not fast enough, not far enough,” Froman . “We keep on pushing toward a full marketdetermined exchange rate, but we are making progress.” The administration’s reluctance to address currency in TPP comes as it is trying to bring those talks to a close after nearly five  of negotiations. It also wants lawmakers to approve legislation known as trade promotion authority, which would allow the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for straight upordown votes without any amendments. Rep. Dan Kildee (DMich.)  it was hard for him to understand why the administration thinks it is too complicated to include currency in the pact. Detroitbased automakers have been among the most vocal in pushing for a currency provision as one way of keeping auto imports from Japan in check. “This is going to be a complicated agreement,”  Kildee, whose district includes the birthplace of General Motors in Flint, Michigan. “It’s not like the other areas are uncomplicated. It’s very complicated, especially when you have the number of states that are included in the negotiation. It’s complex by definition.” Kildee conceded that he was likely to vote against TPA, but  he was still hoping to improve the AsiaPacific trade pact by keeping pressure on the administration to address currency concerns. “Currency is a particular challenge in the auto sector,” Kildee . “So for those of us who have significant problems with both process and the substance [of TPP], we still want to make the agreement better if we can. So we still have an obligation to stay involved on all the issues.” Meanwhile, proponents of including a currency provision in TPP are driving home their point by dredging up statements Obama made on currency manipulation when he was in the Senate. In a letter to thenU.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in June 2007, Obama faulted the Bush administration for failing to label China a “currency manipulator” in a semiannual report on foreign currency practices. The Obama administration in its six  in office has also declined to label China a currency manipulator in the report, which is due to be released again on April 15. However, Obama’s letter to Paulson still resonates because of a point that he made about trade promotion authority, which back then was set to expire in just a few weeks. “The administration’s refusal to take strong action against China’s currency manipulation will also make it more difficult to obtain congressional approval for renewed trade promotion authority, as well as additional trade agreements,” Obama . “Treasury’s refusal even to acknowledge the costs of Chinese currency manipulation justifies the fear of many Americans that this administration lacks the will to stand up against trade abuses and labor or environmental violations that create an unfair playing field for American workers.” A number of lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have been working on currency legislation that could be incorporated into a broader TPA bill. In recent , both chambers have passed bills that would allow the Commerce Department to slap duties on goods from countries with undervalued currencies, but none of those measures ever reached all the way to Obama’s desk to be signed into law. The TPA bill being negotiated by leaders of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees is already expected to include a negotiating objective on currency, based on an earlier version of the legislation that was unveiled last . In making the case for TPA, Froman has argued the bill’s negotiating objectives are how Congress gives the administration its “marching orders.” But on currency, it seems like the administration and Congress could be marching to the beat of different drummers.',\n",
       " 'Trade: Vietnam Not to Hesitate to Open Market as Commitment to AEC: Minister 4 February 2015 Vietnam News Brief Service Vietnam will not hesitate to open domestic market for member of the 10 ASEAN member countries when the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is formed by the end of this ,  Minister of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang. Opening domestic market is a principle of reciprocity. The principle is created based on the fact that two or more sides involved are trying to get the core benefits of trade in goods. If Vietnam increases exports to a given market, it must also have an open door policy for commodities of other countries, the minister made the speech at a Q&A session on Feb 1. Therefore, Vietnam asked trading partners to open up their markets for Vietnamese products while negotiating on free trade agreements. In contrast, Vietnam also pledged to open its market for export items of these countries. However, Vietnam has always had a clear roadmap, especially in terms of sensitive goods of which domestic production capacity is limited. For instant, Vietnam has made possible the application of tariff quotas without causing a negative impact on domestic production, while keeping up with WTO commitments, he added. Commenting on the risk facing Vietnamese goods when the AEC is established, as thousands of imported items enjoying tax reductions may enter Vietnam following the establishments of foreignowned retail facilities, the minister  that Vietnam will open its market gradually and cautiously. Besides, for each commodity, Vietnam has a different degree of opening. Therefore, if we take prudent steps, Vietnamese firms should not be afraid of the establishment of the AEC, the minister stressed. Interview',\n",
       " '‘Decades of Swiss banking secrecy have left their mark’ By Samuel Jaberg Swissinfo.ch Feb 3, 2015 17:00 Switzerland, along with around 100 other countries, will put an end to its treasured practice of banking secrecy when the treaty on automatic exchange of information between tax authorities comes into force in 2018. The country is hoping that being proactive in the implementation of the new rules will both shield it from new attacks and enable it to help shape the laws into something it finds palatable. But decades of shady banking practices and the country’s initial reluctance to end banking secrecy after the 2009 financial crisis have left their mark on the country’s reputation. It is not always easy to convince others of Switzerland’s good intentions, says Jacques de Watteville, State Secretary for International Financial Matters, and the man in charge of Swiss efforts in the area. swissinfo.ch: Switzerland has always been protective of its banking secrecy and only reluctantly changed its stance at the last moment. In the context of the automatic exchange of information, the country is now actively collaborating in framing these rules. What has it obtained in exchange? Jacques de Watteville: All the criteria Switzerland fought for were accepted and included in the new rules which around 100 countries have agreed to adopt. The automatic exchange of information should apply to everyone in the same manner on the basis of reciprocity. Information can only be exchanged for clearly defined purposes and will be subject to data protection. Finally, transparency will apply equally to trusts and other legal entities. Another  element is that all the main financial centres have agreed to put the automatic exchange of information into practice. So, we can now fight on equal terms with Luxembourg, Austria, Singapore, Hong Kong or Jersey. The list of “noncooperative” countries is being considerably reduced. There are still a few shady areas, but they will not be able to resist the current developments. swissinfo.ch: The automatic exchange of information seemed unthinkable two  ago. Have you been surprised by these developments? J.dW.: Everybody has been surprised by the speed of these changes. Two  ago nobody thought we would be here today, including those in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). There has been very strong momentum in favour of this major development. The crisis of 2009 reinforced international cooperation in fighting tax evasion and marked a real turning point. That , Switzerland first decided to provide administrative assistance not only in cases of fraud but also for tax evasion and then we developed a strategy designed to ensure Swiss banks only held declared funds. Following that, rejection by the German parliament of the ‘Rubik’ accord on taxation between Switzerland and Germany coincided with the international push for the automatic exchange of information. To avoid being marginalised and subjected to increased pressure, and to maintain our competitiveness, we had to take on these measures at the same time as the others. But the attitude of the Swiss banks was also decisive. Whereas previously they had done everything to stop it, they subsequently came out in favour of the automatic exchange of information and invested a lot of resources in lobbying for it. swissinfo.ch: The government seems set on the path of automatic exchange, but in the event of a referendum are the parliament and the people ready to completely abandon banking secrecy for foreign clients of Swiss banks? J.dW.: The debate will be intense but most of the political players have accepted the issues and the international developments underway. Within the population, a concerted effort at communication is needed. The automatic exchange of information allows for more transparency and equality in taxation matters. It reduces the possibilities of fraud, something which is in the interests of all honest taxpayers in this country. swissinfo.ch: The automatic exchange of information is a model for the future but it does not resolve the problems of the past, such as the legalisation of undeclared funds parked in Swiss banks. There are still a lot of unanswered questions. J.dW.: There is a mutual interest in resolving this problem. For example, we have reached an agreement with Italy, which wants to avoid a massive exodus of taxable capital. It has offered citizens with undeclared funds in Switzerland an attractive solution to regularise their affairs before the automatic exchange of information comes into force. Our banks also have an interest in finding a solution which will allow them to continue to manage these funds. Significant progress has been achieved with regard to other neighbouring countries. Most of the German funds in Switzerland have already been regularised, as has a good portion of French funds. swissinfo.ch: Several countries have attacked Swiss banks, forcing them to pay huge fines, in addition to legal and administrative fees. Is Switzerland not paying a heavy price for its staunch defence of banking secrecy and its belated commitment to international norms? J.dW.: It’s not only Switzerland’s slow pace in adapting to international norms that is to blame, but also the attitude of certain banks which continued to help American clients avoid their fiscal obligations even when they knew it was illegal. These banks bear a heavy responsibility for what happened next. swissinfo.ch: In February, the OECD Global Forum will assess Switzerland’s readiness to move on to the second phase of evaluation. Do you think it will meet with a favourable response? J.dW.: We have put a lot of effort into making sure the results of this evaluation will be positive. In our view, the efforts we have made justify our promotion from phase one to phase two. But the decades of Swiss banking secrecy have left their mark. Some countries question whether Switzerland is really sincere. It’s up to us to vanquish these doubts and demonstrate that our actions are serious. Automatic exchange of information, how does it work? According to the system designed by the OECD, banks will collect data on their clients and transfer it to their national taxation authorities, which then forward it in encrypted form to the authorities in the respective countries. The name, address, account number and balance will be divulged, as well as interest payments, dividends and the purchase and sale of securities. The rules apply to private citizens as well as businesses, including the beneficiaries of trusts or foundations. The automatic exchange of information concerns banks, but also negotiators, investment funds and assurers. It applies only to financial data. Elements of fortunes such as works of art or real estate are not covered. END ________________________________',\n",

       " 'Trade proposal would open up foreign health coverage By Adam Behsudi | 2/4/15 3:02 AM EST POLITICO Countries negotiating a new services trade deal are considering a proposal that would allow them to tap into a growing stream of medical tourists seeking cutrate treatments on everything from bypass surgery to knee replacements. A concept paper introduced by Turkey in the Trade in Services Agreement negotiations would make health care a more tradable commodity, giving patients the opportunity to have foreign care covered by their own public or private insurance plans. Trade in health services may create opportunities and have a number of benefits not only for the business partners involved in trade, but for the population as a whole, the proposal says. Some countries suffer from shortages in the health sector (human or capital). The paper, which POLITICO obtained after it was leaked by the Associated Whistleblowing Press, was reportedly circulated among trade officials from the 28 European Union member states at an Oct. 3 meeting. The EU, Turkey, United States and 20 other countries participating in the services negotiations discussed proposals on patient mobility at the latest round of talks in December, according to the Australian government. The 10th round of services negotiations, which will be chaired by the United States, will take place next week in Geneva. The leaked paper argues that health care services in different countries often offer lower costs, shorter wait times and other comparative advantages that consumers find in other services sectors. But because most health services are funded and provided by state or nonprofit organizations, the sector is of virtually no interest for foreign competitors. In short, there is a huge untapped potential for the globalization of health care services, the proposal says, citing a 2006 study as its primary source. That 2006 study, by economists Mattoo Aaditya and Randeep Rathindran, argues that health care providers should be willing to reimburse patients seeking lowrisk surgical treatments abroad because lower costs would create savings for the industry and improve treatment options for patients. Their paper points out that most U.S. health plans, both public and private, dont cover nonemergency care overseas. The CDC estimates that up to 750,000 Americans travel to countries in Asia and Latin America each  in search of cheaper medical services, including everything from cosmetic and heart surgery to dental work. But critics of the proposal were quick to point out the potential to undermine health care systems in developed countries. Such coverage could also raise the price of medical care in developing nations and create a twotiered health system in those countries that caters to wealthier tourist patients, according to a study by Odile Frank, health and social services officer for Public Services International, a trade union group for public sector workers. People seeking treatment offshore means that money is drawn out of the national health system, whose low level of investment is cited as one of the rationale for offshore treatment, and makes the problem selfperpetuating, University of Auckland law professor Jane Kelsey says in a separate analysis of the proposal. In a country with a strong public health care system, such as New Zealand, Kelsey says, the proposal could provide a justification to decrease investment in the system. Taxpayer funding for a patient would also be transferred into another countrys private health system, she argues. Public Services International estimates that the weighted average share of gross domestic product that goes to health care in the 50 countries negotiating the services trade deal is considerable at 12.5 percent. The organization argues that the proposal would lead to huge profits for private health care companies, with the countries combined $6 trillion in GDP expenditures on health care per  amounting to 90 percent of the annual global expenditure on health. Health is a human right and is not for sale or for trade, says Rosa Pavanelli, the labor groups general secretary. The health system exists to keep our families safe and healthy, not to ensure the profits of large corporations. The proposal would add a health care services annex to the services agreement, creating a system in which health professionals would grant prior authorization to their patients to be treated in other countries in the deal. Patients would then have the right to have a procedure reimbursed up to the cost of the treatment in their home countries by their public or private insurers. A country would be able to accredit health providers in another country to ensure quality and standards for citizens seeking treatment there, according to the proposal. Upon completion of the medical procedure, the home country would bear the responsibility of any necessary care after treatment. The paper suggests the annex be a framework deal, allowing the countries to decide the details of implementation. Despite the criticisms, the paper is careful to state that any system the proposal might establish shouldnt prevent countries from organizing their healthcare and social security systems to determine eligibility for treatment. We recognize that health is not a typical commodity or service but a public good, the paper says. Trade objectives in the health sector should be compatible with other social objectives like universal access.',\n",

       " \"EU GMO Approval Gridlock Could Trigger Renewed WTO Action, U.S. Exporters Say By Joe Kirwin WTO Reporter, February 5, 2015 Feb. 4 Continued gridlock in the European Union process for approving genetically modified (GM) crops, food and feed could trigger the reopening of a successful World Trade Organization complaint brought by the U.S. in the early 2000s, according to U.S. grain exporters as well as officials with the European biotechnology and food processing industries. Speaking at a stakeholder conference held Feb. 4 during the eighth round of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks between the EU and the U.S., Floyd Gaibler, director of trade policy and biotechnology for the U.S. Grains Council, told Bloomberg BNA that he and others have talked with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) about reopening the WTO case, in which the WTO ruled in 2006 that the EU had violated international rules by maintaining a de facto moratorium on the approval of GM crops and foods made from them (26 WTO, 2/8/06). The EU now has another de facto moratorium in place similar to what they had in the early 2000s when the WTO case was launched by the United States, Gaibler . The U.S. won that case and it is still open. The EU has not approved a GM crop since November of 2013. They have 12 applications pending that have been given scientific approval. Now the new European Commission is reviewing the whole approval process, Gaibler . We are talking with USTR officials and reopening the WTO case is an option. EU Industries Share U.S. Concerns U.S. corn and soybean exporters are frustrated with the approval process, a feeling also shared by the European biotechnology, food processing and livestock sectors, which urged the European Commission in 2014 to approve six pending applications they consider economically crucial to their industries. The same EU groups renewed their efforts in a Feb. 3 letter sent to the new European Commission in advance of a special meeting of the EU executive body to be held Feb. 56, during which the stalemated GM approval process will be discussed. The EU relies on imports from third countries to cover 75 percent of its use of proteinrich ingredients for animal feeding purposes, the groups  in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg BNA. The EU food, feed and livestock sectors will face a substantial shortage of raw materials supply, which will also trigger cost increases both for basic food products and major feed ingredients if the decisions for authorization are delayed any further. Officials from the EU food and feed industry, speaking to Bloomberg BNA on condition of anonymity,  that they would support the U.S. reopening the WTO case against the EU if the current gridlock does not change. We hope it does not come to that but it might be the only way to change the current situation, an EU food processing official told Bloomberg BNA on condition of anonymity. Stacked Events,' Sound Science An official from the EU biotechnology industry  that even if the EU approval gridlock were to end in the near future, it would not trigger new imports because of what is known in the biotechnology industry as stacked events, where new genetic traits have been added to a previously authorized GM crop. Unlike in the U.S., the EU regulatory approval process requires any GM crop with a stacked event to undergo a whole new evaluation, Beat Spath, director of agricultural biotechnology with EuropaBio, which represents the EU biotechnology industry, told Bloomberg BNA. Meanwhile, both U.S. grain exporters and EU food processing, animal feed and livestock officials also  that they are concerned the European Commission could try to give each of the 28 EU member states the right to ban GM crops for food and feed in the same way the EU recently approved legislation giving member states the right to ban the cultivation of GM crops for reasons other than sound science. This would be a disaster,  Gaibler. A highlevel European Commission official confirmed that such a plan is being considered and will be discussed at the Feb. 56 EU executive body meeting. There are various options on the table,  the official, who spoke to Bloomberg BNA on condition of anonymity. This is one of them. The new EU laws on GM cultivation will take effect in April. It is being considered to make a similar proposal for the GM food and feed applications.\",\n",
       " 'No safeguard duty on imported newsprint 5 February 2015 Manila Bulletin The government has decided not to impose preliminary safeguard duty against imported newsprint from EU but instead proceeded with the full investigation over alleged injury to domestic industry caused by surge in imports of newsprint. Walter van Hattum, head of Economic and Trade Section of the EU Delegation to the Philippines, told reporters covering the CS Garment plant visit in Cavite Economic Zone by EU Delegation officials led by EU Ambassador Guy Ledoux that the Tariff Commission conducted a public hearing last December where all stakeholders were asked to submit their position papers within a 60day period. The investigation was initiated under the Safeguard Measure Act following an evaluation of the petition filed by the domestic newsprint industry, represented by Trust International Paper Corporation (TIPCO), which accounted for about 100 percent of the total Philippine production. Van Hattum  the EU welcomed the decision of the government not to impose preliminary or temporary duty against newsprint imports, which will directly impact newspaper companies. \"It is a good sign,\" Van Hattum . Under the normal process, the agency concerned, in this case the Department of Trade and Industry, should have imposed a preliminary duty when it endorsed to the Commission the petition to impose safeguard duty versus imported newsprint from EU. But the nonimposition of preliminary duty does not preclude the Commission from imposing a punitive import duty anytime. Van Hattum, however, cautioned the use of Safeguard Measure citing it is a very stringent trade tool that must be used sparingly by trading partners. It could be recalled that the Philippines has also launched a Safeguard investigation against steel (galvanized sheets) imports from EU. There has been no progress on this investigation. \"That why we are closely monitoring these safeguard initiatives being launched by the government against EU products,\" he . Van Hattum stressed that the petitioner must prove the causality of importexport of products to establish material injury on the domestic industry. \"But that causality is difficult to prove,\" he . Among EU countries, the United Kingdom is the biggest exporter of newsprint to the Philippines.

Takeo Mori, Japan lead negotiator on auto trade, made that assessment during a press conference at the close of two days of U.S.Japan talks in Washington that also involved Hiroshi Oe, the country lead negotiator for agricultural market access with the United States. \"I think Ambassador Oe has already stated that we are going to have another meeting at our level, at least once and we are aiming at preparation for another ministerial,\" he .

He declined to discuss what issues are outstanding on autos, saying he could not address the substance of the negotiations. In a Feb. 3 interview, Rep.

The auto talks, led on the U.S. side by Acting Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler, encompass a range of issues including special dispute settlement procedures to address nontariff measures in the Japanese market; a special auto safeguard that the U.S. could put in place if auto imports from Japan surge after the U.S. reduces its tariff; and Japanese safety and environmental standards. Earlier this month, Cutler  the two sides made progress on closing gaps on issues related to nontariff measures and dispute settlement in the auto sector.

       " 'Strong dollar revives angst in Congress; Trade: Currency manipulation By Shawn Donnan in Washington 5 February 2015 Financial Times When Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, sits down today to brief members of the Senate finance committee on the president 2016 budget and plans for tax reform he will be bracing himself for questions on at least one other subject. A strong dollar now hitting corporate profits and US exports and the moves by central banks around the world to weaken their own currencies have revived an old angst on Capitol Hill and drawn new battle lines for Congress and its currency warriors. Where once the target was China, now the push is to include tough provisions against currency manipulation in its trade agreements, particularly the TransPacific Partnership, the deal with Japan and 10 other economies that is at the heart of the US international economic agenda and is nearing conclusion. That push has been resisted until now by President Barack Obama. But with the dollar marching ever higher, the carmaking industry and particularly Ford lobbying heavily and both Democratic and Republican legislators clamouring for action, it is an issue that Mr Obama foot soldiers are going to have to face. \"Pretending these concerns don\\'t exist will not suffice,\" Orrin Hatch, the Republican senator who chairs the finance committee, warned recently. The demands from Congress are fairly clear. A majority of both houses demanded in 2013 that \"strong and enforceable\" provisions against currency manipulation be included in the TPP and those calls continue today. The US car industry argues that trading partners such as China and Japan have been subsidising exports to the US by keeping their currencies weak, a step that has also made US goods less competitive on the return trip. \"Tariffs were last century trade barrier . . . The 21stcentury trade barrier is currency manipulation,\"  Ziad Ojakli, Ford chief lobbyist in Washington. The administration has been loath to act on that call for at least two reasons. The first is that the TPP is already a complex beast and adding in currency provisions might just kill it. The second is a question of jurisdiction. Within the US government trade deals have traditionally been negotiated by the US trade representative office, while the Treasury addresses currency issues. That corresponds with global practice, where currency is the domain of the International Monetary Fund while trade rules are for the World Trade Organisation. Many analysts think including currency rules in a trade agreement would set an awkward precedent. Yet just what the White House can do to satisfy the Congress currency hawks without killing the TPP is unclear. In private conversations officials struggle to offer a solution bar pressing ahead with the that the issue will not be enough on its own to see the TPP die when it comes time for Congress to ratify it. They also point out the US was recently accused of currency manipulation as a result of its quantitative easing. The simplest and most likely option may be for Washington to be more vocal on currency concerns at meetings such as next week G20 gathering of finance ministers, to show adequate concern to Congress over the issue. In an article for Foreign Affairs magazine last month, Fred Bergsten of the Washingtonbased Peterson Institute for International Economics argued that a threepronged, more aggressive US policy would be the \"smart strategy\", whatever happened with the TPP. First, the administration should enforce existing law and restore its international credibility on the issue by formally designating countries such as China currency manipulators. Second, any country manipulating its currency should have its goods subjected to countervailing or punitive duties. And third, the US should be prepared to wage war in the markets and use \"countervailing currency intervention\". China buying a billion dollars to weaken its currency should be countered by a US move to buy the same in renminbi and maintain the status quo, Mr Bergsten argued in his article. \"A few implementations of this policy, or perhaps even just its announcement, should be enough to deter future currency manipulation,\" he wrote. That approach is unlikely to become US government policy any time soon. But in Washington, the politics of currency are becoming volatile once again.',\n",
       " 'Debt mountains spark fears of another crisis Ralph Atkins Financial Times February 5, 2015 12:02 am The world is awash with more debt than before the global financial crisis erupted in 2007, with Chinas debt relative to its economic size now exceeding US levels, according to a report. Global debt has increased by $57tn since 2007 to almost $200tn far outpacing economic growth, calculates McKinsey & Co, the consultancy. As a share of gross domestic product, debt has risen from 270 per cent to 286 per cent. McKinseys survey of debt across 47 countries illustrated in an FT interactive graphic highlights how hopes that the turmoil of the past eight  would spur widespread deleveraging to safer levels of indebtedness were misplaced. The report calls for fresh approaches to preventing future debt crises. Overall debt relative to gross domestic product is now higher in most nations than it was before the crisis, McKinsey reports. Higher levels of debt pose questions about financial stability. Overall, almost half of the increase in global debt since 2007 was in developing economies, but a third was the result of higher government debt levels in advanced economies. Households have also increased debt levels across economies the most notable exceptions being crisishit countries such as Ireland and the US. There are few indications that the current trajectory of rising leverage will change, the report says. This calls into question basic assumptions about debt and deleveraging and the adequacy of tools available to manage debt and avoid future crises. Countries that McKinsey warns face potential vulnerabilities because of high household debt include the Netherlands, South Korea, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Malalysia and Thailand. It is like a balloon. If you squeeze debt in one place, it pops up somewhere else in the system, says Richard Dobbs, one of the reports authors. One bright spot, McKinsey says, is evidence of deleveraging by banks. Financial sector debt relative to GDP has declined in the US and a few other crisishit countries, and stabilised in other advanced economies. Chinas total debt, including the financial sector, has nearly quadrupled since 2007 to the equivalent of 282 per cent of GDP. That was higher than in the US although China is lower if financial sector debt is excluded to avoid double counting. McKinsey warns of risks in Chinas property sector, local government financing and a rapidly expanding shadow banking system. The countrys overall debt appears manageable, McKinsey says, but its indebtedness would restrict its ability to compensate for slower longterm growth in advanced economies. Before the [post2007] crisis there was one area where debt was very low and stable, and that was China, says Luigi Buttiglione, head of global strategy at hedge fund Brevan Howard and coauthor of a report in September on global indebtedness. When there was a crisis in the west, China could lever up. Now that is not the case. The report is likely to fuel debates among economists about what is an appropriate level of debt in an economy. McKinsey argues much of the expansion in developing countries has reflected the healthy development of financial markets, but in advanced economies high debt could constrain growth and create fresh financial vulnerabilities. High debt levels could make it harder for central banks to normalise monetary policy without disrupting the real economy the US Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates this  for the first time since 2006. High debt levels are an outward sign of structural problems, says Charles Dumas, chairman of Lombard Street Research. The report comes as Greece this week has pushed for a radical rethink by its creditors of ways of tackling its debt and economic problems. Among the fresh approaches McKinsey suggests are innovations in mortgages and other debt contracts to better share risks between borrowers and creditors. Other steps it discusses to prevent future crises include debt reschedulings and even writing off debt bought by central banks under quantitative easing programmes. If debt held by government agencies and the central bank were excluded, Japans government debt to GDP ratio would fall from 234 per cent to 94 per cent. But such quickfix deleveraging could itself cause financial turmoil, McKinsey acknowledges. McKinseys conclusions echo warnings by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, which acts as a thinktank for central bankers. BIS research had found that when private sector credittoGDP ratios are significantly above their longterm trend, banking strains are likely to follow within three , Jaime Caruana, BIS general manager,  in a speech late last .',\n",

       " 'Environmental Goods Agreement Talks Focus on Clean Energy Products Bridges, 5 February 2015 The latest round of talks towards securing a tariffcutting deal on select environmental goods made progress last week, trade sources say, with several participating countries presenting indicative lists of product nominations related to cleaner and renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency. Following another discussion round next month, the talks for an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) could move into full negotiation mode in the second quarter of this , officials confirmed, as long as the process continues to head in the right direction. The US and the EU are  to have tabled the largest lists of indicative product nominations in last week’s energyfocused round, with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Switzerland also proposing products to include. China has not yet come forward with indicative product nominations for either this round or the ones preceding it, although it reportedly promised to do so for the EGA’s next session in midMarch, citing the need for more time in order to coordinate internally. Last week’s meeting reportedly saw some technical discussion on renewable energy products, including in relation to component parts. Some participants also backed including equipment used in hydropower applications in the eventual EGA. Sources say that some participants also expressed preferences for including goods related to nuclear power, biodiesel, methanol, wood products, as well as hybrid vehicles, all of which are likely to prompt some further conversations within the group. These talks are the result of a pledge made a  ago at the World Economic Forum (WEF) gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where a group of 14 WTO members announced plans to negotiate this Environmental Goods Agreement. Formal talks then began last July. (See BioRes, 10 July 2014) In the past, EGA participants  that they would build on a list of environmental goods under 54 tariff lines agreed to by the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 2012, with the possibility of including other products. The 21country APEC group has committed to lowering applied tariffs on these 54 tariff lines to five percent or less by the end of this . From discussion to negotiation March’s discussion round will focus on environmental monitoring, analysis, and assessment, environmentallypreferable products, and resource efficiency. Sources confirmed that the discussion approach has served to help participants finetune their product proposals, particularly in terms of “exouts,” which are product descriptions where international customs codes are not detailed enough. A total of five technical discussion rounds have been held so far in Geneva, Switzerland, each examining product nominations related to specific environmental goods categories or sectors. EGA participants have  that this “category approach” is geared towards ensuring the environmental credibility of the products nominated and selected for inclusion in the eventual list slated for tariff cuts. EGA negotiators reportedly agreed last week that each participant’s initial product nominations – across each of the environmental goods categories discussed – should be put forward by the beginning of April. That date represents a soft deadline, however, with participants agreeing to be flexible if necessary. Once EGA participants come forward with these compiled lists, the talks would then move into a second phase geared more towards concrete negotiations, beginning with a week of consultations in early May. Two further rounds were reportedly agreed to last week, one planned for 1519 June and another for 2731 July. Climate context While last week’s discussions focused on the details of trade in energyrelated products, delegates reportedly are keeping in mind parallel efforts to negotiate a global climate deal under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in time for this December’s Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris, France. A number of EGA participants have  that the deal offers an opportunity for trade policy to do something positive on climate action. With the energy supply sector being the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to UN climate scientists, boosting trade in clean energy and energy efficiency products could play a role in curbing manmade climate change. “Reducing tariffs on environmental goods can enable innovation and deployment to other countries, thus helping to scale up low carbon development,”  Danish Ambassador to the WTO Carsten Staur at an event hosted last Monday by ICTSD on the EGA’s climate potential. [Editor’s note: ICTSD is the publisher of Bridges] A number of goods relevant for the supply of clean energy, in particular solar cells, panels, and modules, are already dutyfree in all EGA markets due to the initiative’s current participants also being signatories to the WTO’s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) – a separate plurilateral tariffcutting initiative covering select information and communication technology (ICT) products. Various other goods in this area could, however, still usefully be added to the list according to some researchers. EGA participants have set themselves the goal of reaching some form of agreement by the WTO’s tenth ministerial conference this December in Nairobi, Kenya. Whether the EGA talks could have come far enough along to deliver a signal of success in time for the Paris climate talks, which are scheduled prior to the WTO’s Nairobi meet, remains an open question and will be difficult to evaluate until participants move into more formal negotiations. ITA lessons? In the corridors last week, some delegates reflected on the need to learn from the ITA experience, particularly around a review process for the eventual EGA list. Efforts among a subset of the ITA’s signatories to expand the deal’s product coverage to reflect the realities of today’s trade – given the technological advances seen since the original agreement was finalised in 1996 – have repeatedly stalled in recent . The negotiations are currently deadlocked over a disagreement between China and South Korea. (See Bridges Weekly, 18 December 2014) Some experts have argued that it would be  for the EGA negotiations to create a review mechanism as part of the EGA in order to ensure a “living list.” This could be useful in the context of evolving climate mitigation and adaptation technologies and needs, for example, as well as keeping pace with other environmental challenges. However, no detailed formal discussion has yet taken place on this topic, although some sources suggest that a forthcoming EU nonpaper on draft elements for the eventual EGA text – which the 28nation bloc has suggested it will circulate to other EGA participants following internal consultations – could possibly prompt further talks in this area. New members The latest round saw Israel formally join the talks, following domestic approval by existing members, bringing total EGA participants to 15. Turkey and Iceland have also applied to join the initiative, and sources say that the various domestic procedures among other participants will likely have concluded in time to bring these two nations into the talks for the March round.',\n",
       " 'Doha Round: Farm Exporters Question US Subsidies as Trade Talks Resume Bridges, 5 February 2015 US farm subsidies could exceed proposed new WTO limits by as much as US$3.6 billion, a new paper from a dozen agricultural exporting countries has . The paper is the first attempt this  to move negotiators towards a more specific discussion of what they see as desirable and feasible under a possible Doha Round deal on trade. The countries argue that Washington’s levels of agricultural domestic support could breach proposed ceilings under the global trade body’s longrunning Doha talks. The limits are set out in a draft text tabled six  ago, but are now back at the centre of a renewed bid to move the talks forward. WTO members have given themselves until July to ink a work programme that would outline how to resolve the various outstanding issues in the Doha Round talks, with agriculture, nonagricultural market access, and services at the core. (See Bridges Weekly, 27 November 2014) The 12 countries that sponsored the paper – all of which are members of the Cairns Group of farm exporters – now say the latest official US figures suggest that the proposed Doha disciplines would be surpassed by “a considerable margin.” John Adank, the New Zealand ambassador who chairs the WTO agriculture negotiations, welcomed the paper’s focus on specific details. “We have to get very, very concrete,” he told an informal meeting open to all agricultural trade negotiators last Wednesday, at which the paper was discussed. The paper was tabled by Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam. Nine other Cairns Group members did not cosponsor the original submission, with some sources saying that they had had insufficient time to consult their capitals on the document following a change in last Wednesday’s meeting date. Focus on six “central” countries The paper focuses on six members which the sponsors say play a “central role” in the trade talks: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. Except for the US, the report finds that proposed new disciplines would allow these countries to maintain farm subsidy spending at the most recent level the government reported to the WTO. The exporters’ paper examines the possible implications of cuts to three categories of tradedistorting domestic support. Firstly, the drafters examine how cuts could affect countries’ use of “amber box” support – seen as the most heavily tradedistorting under WTO rules. Secondly, it looks at how proposed reductions might affect “de minimis”support, which although tradedistorting is permitted so long as it does not exceed a certain share of the value of production, which is currently set at five percent for developed countries and ten percent for most developing countries. Thirdly, it looks at the implications of proposed new rules for “overall trade distorting domestic support” – the sum of amber box, de minimis, and the slightly less tradedistorting “blue box” programmes. Proposed cuts to countries’ de minimis allowance would mean the US would have to shift US$4.4 billion of agricultural domestic support from that category to the amber box, the sponsors say. This would push Washington’s spending up to US$11.2 billion – or as much as US$3.6 billion more than the proposed new limit on amber box support. The paper does not examine subsidies that are exempt from any cap or cuts under WTO rules – such as green box payments, which are required not to cause more than minimal trade distortion, and input and investment subsidies in developing countries, which are allowed without any upper limit under a special provision in the Agreement on Agriculture. “This is really new territory for us to venture into, but it’s necessary that we start this exploration,”  Adank. Farm Bill: falling prices could push support higher In comments to Bridges, trade sources observed that the paper also does not account for new farm subsidy schemes introduced under the 2014 Agriculture Act, known as the Farm Bill, which some experts expect could increase levels of tradedistorting support if prices for agricultural goods continue to fall from their peaks in 2011. (See Bridges Weekly, 15 January 2015) Officials told Bridges that the falling prices for farm goods meant they were now constantly worried that Washington’s farm subsidy levels could increase further. Delegates disagree on data However, in a reference to controversy over different ways of calculating farm subsidy levels, the sponsors of the new paper caution that their use of official data does not “constitute an endorsement” of governments’ reporting practices. In recent , WTO members have increasingly disagreed over methodological questions such as whether agricultural domestic support data can be reported in local currencies or US dollars, whether and how inflation can be taken into account, and whether calculations of market price support should be benchmarked against total production or just the amount that is actually purchased by the government. Delays in reporting farm support have also repeatedly bedevilled attempts to understand how proposed new rules could affect countries’ farm subsidy payments. Last September, India filled a seven backlog in notifications by reporting farm subsidy data up to 201011, but – despite fastgrowing farm support – the new paper’s figures for China only go up to 2008. (See Bridges Weekly, 18 September 2014 and 19 October 2011, respectively) A previous paper on domestic support, issued by the Cairns Group nearly a  ago, riled India and China by using a new measure of “total trade distorting support” to calculate subsidy levels. This measure included other forms of farm support that are exempt from WTO limits, such as input and investment subsidies in developing countries. (See Bridges Weekly, 27 March 2014) Other countries react One risk, a developing country observed, is that “the only one that will really benefit from this paper is the United States.” Some negotiators also told Bridges that there was a risk that other countries would now be asked to make further concessions in the talks, despite the fact that the US had done little to reform farm support programmes to reduce their tradedistorting effects. Sources  that the US had reacted by saying the new paper showed that the current Doha draft was unbalanced. Some developing countries responded by arguing that this was a consequence of having to address the imbalances that had been inherited from past negotiating rounds. Some delegates  the exporters’ findings seemed to suggest that WTO members should lower the “level of ambition” for the talks in order to strike a deal by the end of the . But others told Bridges they felt uncomfortable with this approach. “We will not tailor the negotiations for the United States,”  one. Adank encouraged members to continue focusing on specific details in order to advance the talks further. “My really strong advice to you all as we leave this meeting is please get more concrete with each other, because if we stay in this sea of generalities we’re probably not going to get that far.”',\n",

       " 'Canada Minister Expects WTO COOL Win, Vows Trade Retaliation If Changes Not Made By Jeremy Hainsworth WTO Reporter, February 6, 2015 Feb. 5 –Canadian officials intend to apply to the World Trade Organization to take retaliatory tariff measures against the U.S. once the WTO makes public its ruling—expected in April—regarding the U.S. country of origin labeling (COOL) requirements on imported beef, Canada Minister of Agriculture and AgriFood Gerry Ritz  Feb. 5. “If this is what required to have fair trade, this is the route we must take,” Ritz  during a media conference call from Washington where he has led a delegation of Canadian beef and pork producers. Ritz  he fully expects the WTO to rule again in Canada favor. The WTO recently ruled COOL is a violation of U.S. trade obligations, and the decision is under appeal (243 WTO, 12/18/14). Both Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if changes are not made. “Retaliation is not Canada preferred option,” Ritz . “We would prefer a fair solution to be found outside WTO process and sooner rather than later. An appropriate way to fix this issue would be to repeal the red meat sections of COOL immediately so we can put the WTO and retaliation issues to bed.” Retaliatory Effects “COOL continues to take us one step backwards hurting our industries on both sides of the border,” Ritz . He added that $44 billion in agriculture and food products cross the border each . Ritz  COOL is costing Canada beef and pork industry $1 billion (C$804.7 million) a , adding that the damages would be addressed when trade issues have been resolved. Meanwhile, 35 U.S. states have Canada as a primary export market, including $2 billion in beef and pork sales to Canada, he . Trade action would take a heavy toll on states such as California, with $600 million (C$482.8 million) trade, and Texas, with $300 million (C$241.4 million) in trade, he . The COOL rules, unveiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May 2013, require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered and bar the mixing of muscle cuts from different countries under a general label (101 WTO, 5/24/13). Playing COOL Politics “COOL is a political solution for a problem that does not exist,” Ritz . “It creating huge rifts in [the] North American livestock system.” Ritz held bilateral discussions with representatives from the U.S. House and Senate agriculture committees and  Congress asked for a legislative fix to COOL from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “It a line in the sand that puts more pressure on the White House to fix this flawed legislation. It endangering American jobs. It must be fixed,” Ritz  He  retaliatory measures could be targeted at areas represented by members of Congress who have not been “helpful” in the dispute. Ritz  he also met with Mexican allies “who are standing strong with Canada.” “We will do what it takes to stand up for an integrated North American livestock industry and we will not rest until the job is complete,” he . Verlyn Olso, Alberta provincial minister of agriculture and rural development, was also in Washington Feb. 35 to advocate for changes to the COOL requirements.

Cybersecurity has been a significant irritant in U.S.China ties, with both sides accusing the other of abuses. U.S. tech groups wrote to the Chinese administration about the same policies on Jan. 28. New cybersecurity regulations would force technology vendors to Chinese banks to hand over secret source code and adopt Chinese encryption algorithms.

       " 'Appellate Body Ruling In China CVD Case Slams U.S. On Benchmark Pricing Inside U.S. Trade 02/06/2015 An Appellate Body ruling adopted by the World Trade Organization last month expanded the scope of China victory against the United States by faulting the way the U.S. uses benchmark prices to calculate whether there is a benefit in its countervailing duty (CVD) investigations as violating the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM). This came on top of three adverse findings against U.S. CVD methodology handed down by the panel in its July 2014 ruling in the case, known as DS437, none of which were appealed by the United States. All four of the findings are \"as applied\" to specific CVD cases, rather than faulting a U.S. policy or practice \"as such.\" If the U.S. opts to comply with the Appellate Body and panel rulings, it would impose a greater burden on the Commerce Department and U.S. petitioners to present more evidence in these specific CVD cases to justify Commerce findings at various stages of the subsidy analysis, according to lawyers familiar with the case. In addition to these four adverse findings, the Appellate Body report handed down on Dec. 22 and adopted by the WTO on Jan. 16 also criticized how Commerce applied \"adverse facts available\" and how Commerce determines the specificity of subsidy programs. But the Appellate Body was ultimately unable to determine if the U.S. in these instances violated the ASCM. This means the U.S. has no compliance obligations on these issues, petitioner and respondent sources . One source  the U.S. would likely wait and see if China raises these same issues in a future dispute before changing its current practice. The first issue faulted by the panel relates to how Commerce determines whether a stateowned enterprise (SOE) is a public body capable of bestowing subsidies within the meaning of the ASCM. The U.S. already lost on this issue in an earlier WTO case brought by China known as DS379. Specifically, the panel in DS437 faulted the U.S. in 12 CVD investigations for determining that SOE is a public body capable of providing subsidies simply because it is government controlled. In line with the ruling in DS379, the panel found that the U.S. instead has to demonstrate that the SOE is performing a \"government function\" or has \"government authority.\" The panel also faulted the U.S. for initiating the investigations based solely on the existence of export restraints in two CVD proceedings, and for not considering the appropriate factors in determining whether a subsidy was de facto specific in 12 CVD proceedings. The U.S. would likely comply with the four adverse findings in DS437 by initiating a socalled \"Section 129\" proceeding, in which Commerce would review the CVD determinations and perhaps alter the margins in order to take into account the Appellate Body findings, sources . Section 129 is the provision of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation that allows Commerce and the International Trade Commission to reopen trade remedy cases to implement adverse findings handed down at the WTO. U.S. petitioners blasted the Appellate Body ruling in DS437, saying it would make it harder to prove the existence of subsidies and their effects. \"It troubling that the WTO, which opposes subsidies, is making it so much harder to prove subsidies and to prove their harmful effects,\"  Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley Rein who represented the U.S. petitioner in a trade remedy case involving Chinese solar products. The solar case was one of 17 CVD investigations challenged by China in DS437. At issue on benchmark pricing was Commerce practice of excluding private or incountry prices in China because the department believes they are too distorted by government intervention in order to calculate the benefit an exporter is receiving. Whether a subsidy bestowed a benefit is the second step in the threepart subsidy definition under the ASCM. The three steps are whether a financial contribution by government or a public body exists, whether it confers a benefit, and whether it is specific to an enterprise or group of enterprises. The panel upheld Commerce practice of excluding incountry prices, but the Appellate Body overturned that finding, faulting the panel for not conducting a casebycase analysis on whether Commerce had correctly determined that the private Chinese products were too distorted by government interference. It then completed the analysis and found that the U.S. rejection of these incountry prices in 12 CVD investigations violated Articles 14(d) and Article 1.1(b) of the ASCM. Article 14(d) states that the purchase of goods and services by a government are not considered a benefit unless it is done for less or more than adequate remuneration, which is based on the country market conditions. Article 1.1(b) states that subsidies only exist if a benefit is conferred. According to one domestic industry source, the U.S. was faulted here because Commerce did not \"properly explain why they rejected the incountry prices as a benchmark.\" The U.S. was highly critical of the Appellate Body finding on benchmark prices at a Jan. 16 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body where the report was adopted. \"In short, the Appellate Body has departed from its wellreasoned finding … that the private prices from armslength transactions in the country of provision are the \\'primary\\' benchmark. And, the Appellate Body has provided no meaningful explanation about how a price by a government entity could be used to establish a marketbased benchmark,\" the U.S. . Respondent sources took the position that this ruling ends Commerce presumption that incountry prices are distorted by government interference. But one source pointed out that the \"battleground\" will now shift into how Commerce determines whether incountry prices are distorted by government interference, as there is no clear method for doing so. The Appellate Body criticized the panel for throwing out China claims regarding adverse facts available and specificity. On adverse facts available, China had argued that the U.S. had relied on adverse \"assumptions\" rather than facts. It also  Commerce did not explicitly point to each fact on the basis of which it used facts available. ASCM Article 12.7 allows investigating authorities to use \"facts available\" in an investigation if respondents do not cooperate in providing necessary information or if they significantly impede the investigation. The panel ruled that determinations based on adverse inferences are not on their face inconsistent with Article 12.7, and that Commerce was not required to explicitly state every fact for which it used facts available. But the Appellate Body overturned that finding and agreed with China that the panel provided only a \"cursory analysis\" of how Commerce justified the use of those adverse facts across 13 CVD investigations. At the same time, the Appellate Body  there was incomplete evidence on the record for it to make determinations as to whether Commerce had justified the use of adverse facts available in these 13 investigations. As a result, it opted not to complete the analysis since doing so would have led to due process concerns. On specificity, China had appealed two separate issues, both relating to ASCM Article 2.1. That article lays out three tests for determining whether a subsidy is specific: if the government explicitly limits access to the subsidy; if the government lays out objective criteria and conditions for being eligible to receive the subsidy, which it has spelled out in laws or regulations; or other factors listed in Article 2.1(c). Among the other factors listed in that article is the use of a subsidy program by a limited number of certain enterprises. In DS437, China had asserted that in 12 CVD investigations, Commerce failed to identify a specific subsidy program within the meaning of Article 2.1(c), as well as the \"granting authority\" of the subsidy program within the meaning of Article 2.1. But the panel rejected these claims. The Appellate Body overturned those findings and slammed the panel for not completing a casebycase analysis with respect to either specificity claim. In both instances, however, the Appellate Body decided not to complete the analysis. This decision was largely based on the fact that the panel had also faulted the U.S. on a third specificity issue under Article 2.1(c), which the U.S. had not appealed. This finding was that the U.S. did not take into account the appropriate considerations in determining whether a subsidy was specific using the \"other factors\" under Article 2.1(c). These considerations, spelled out in the last sentence of Article 2.1(c), requires WTO members to take into account how economically diverse the country is and how long the subsidy program has been in place. Because the U.S. did not appeal this panel finding, the Appellate Body  it saw \"limited value\" in analyzing whether Commerce had violated other aspects of Article 2.1 of the ASCM.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Airlines Attack Their Gulf Rivals By Susan Carey 6 February 2015 The Wall Street Journal The chief executives of the three largest U.S. airlines  they are pressing the government to modify or lacking substantive remedies annul air treaties with two Persian Gulf nations. The CEOs cited what they claim are subsidies and government industrial policies that favor three of the Gulf region fastgrowing carriers, distorting global air transportation. The heads of American Airlines Group Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc.  in a joint interview Thursday that the three stateowned Gulf airlines have received $42.3 billion in \"quantifiable\" subsidies since 2004, accompanied by other benefits including breaks on local airport infrastructure and services, exemptions from corporate taxes and advantages from \"opaque\" relatedparty transactions. The U.S. executives  the policies are giving a big leg up to Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, helping them expand globally by stimulating lowfare traffic through their hubs. More recently, the three Gulf carriers have targeted growth to U.S. airports, where they can fly freely and set prices without restriction due to \"open skies\" treaties between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. The routes from the Gulf region to the U.S. haven\\'t produced a meaningful increase in passenger traffic, the U.S. carriers  in a 55page briefing paper being circulated to officials of the departments of Transportation, State and Commerce, among others. Instead, the new routes \"serve to displace the market share of U.S. airlines and to shift good aviation jobs overseas.\" The three Gulf carriers have boosted the number of daily seats between their hubs and the U.S. by 11,000 since 2008, the document says. But the number of daily bookings between those airports and the U.S., in both directions, which were 2,500 a day in 2008, were up just 85 a day by 2014. The bulk of the U.S. passengers using the Gulf carriers are traveling beyond Dubai, Doha or Abu Dhabi to destinations such as India and Southeast Asia. And that hits the U.S. airlines and their Asian and European partners right where it hurts. Doug Parker, American chief executive,  his team wants to begin flights to India. But the routes won\\'t justify themselves, he , because the fares are so low. And Richard Anderson, Delta CEO,  his airline is leaving the India market altogether for the same reason. Kevin Mitchell of OpenSkies.travel, a grouping of tourism and airline interests, wrote to the three U.S. departments last week, expressing \"deep concerns\" about the U.S. airline CEOs\\' lobbying efforts. He  that after the mergers of six U.S. carriers into three and a situation where the top four airlines control 80% of the U.S. market, \"some . . . shamelessly seek to close off U.S. markets to competition from foreign carriers.\" In a recent interview, Emirates President Tim Clark  the U.S. airlines\\' claims are \"outrageous, unsubstantiated [and] incorrect.\" He  that his company isn\\'t dumping capacity or selling below cost and is profitable on every route it operates from the U.S. \"Tell us where the subsidies are,\" he added. Etihad and Qatar declined to comment. Emirates, now the No. 1 international airline by capacity,  it files public financial statements annually that are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Etihad and Qatar have repeatedly denied they are subsidized. U.S. carriers have been worried about the Gulf carriers since at least 2012, concerned about losing some of their most lucrative international passengers and alarmed by their rivals\\' big buildup of U.S. routes. In 2013, United, Delta, the U.S. trade association Airlines for America, and the largest U.S. pilot union, Air Line Pilots Association, International launched legal and political challenges, and Delta suggested that the U.S. revisit some of its air treaties. But this latest effort by the U.S. airlines is the loudest and most direct response to what they see as a growing threat. Jeff Smisek, United CEO,  the three Gulf carriers \"are not normal airlines. They\\'re arms of the state.\" The premise of openskies treaties, of which the U.S. has signed more than 110 since 1992, is that airlines on both sides receive access, but on a level playing field and free of subsidies, he . European airlines have already been devastated by the Gulf airlines\\' rapid growth into their natural markets,  American Mr. Parker. \"We don\\'t want to see it get to the point [in the U.S.] where it is in Europe.\" Richard Anderson, Delta CEO,  that the airlines\\' efforts are like those of steelmakers or agricultural firms trying to stop imports of deeply subsidized products, and that the airlines\\' problem demands a \"triedandtrue\" tradepolicy remedy. The three U.S. CEOs  they met last week with representatives of the Departments of Transportation, State and Commerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and others. The DOT  it is carefully reviewing the U.S. claims and is closely coordinating with its governmental partners. \"However, no decisions have been made,\"  a spokeswoman, noting that the DOT is committed to the \\'open skies.\\' The other agencies couldn\\'t immediately be reached for comment. United Mr. Smisek  it has taken a couple of  for the three U.S. airlines to \"scour the planet\" with forensic accounting to document the three Gulf airlines\\' financial records. The U.S. carriers say they identified breaks including free land, forgiven hedging contracts and nonunion rules that help the foreign airlines keep costs down, surmount big accumulated losses and still order huge numbers of new widebody jetliners. The information in the briefing paper \"is new . . . and compelling and clearly shows there has been subsidization of these carriers,\"  American Mr. Parker. He added that American won\\'t terminate its severalold codesharing agreement with Etihad, which helps American passengers get to destinations the U.S. airline doesn\\'t serve. But American, as a company that needs to cover its cost of capital, wants to compete fairly, he . The carriers hope to persuade the U.S. to enter \"consultations\" with the Gulf countries and negotiate new rules. Barring that, they would like the U.S. to freeze the Gulf airlines\\' expansion into the U.S. In the absence of new accords, they would like want to see the air treaties terminated with the requisite  notice, the briefing paper , even though the U.S. airlines fundamentally favor open skies agreements.',\n",
       " 'China timber demand stokes Southeast Asia tensions Michael Peel in Bangkok Financial Times February 5, 2015 10:53 am Soaring demand from China’s new wealthy is fuelling the illicit trade in rare southeast Asian luxury wood, stoking political tensions over natural resource flows from the region’s nations to their giant neighbour to the north. Hunger for neoclassical redwood furniture has raised prices for some forms of timber to tens of thousands of dollars per cubic metre and sparked deadly clashes between tree poachers and rangers in the sprawling forests of the Mekong region. The problem has added to alarm over the crossborder stream to China of other highvalue products such as ivory, shark’s fins and jade. A report published on Thursday by Global Witness, the Londonbased campaign group, highlights fresh concerns about how Cambodia, a close ally of China, has allowed the luxury timber business to flourish by relaxing legal safeguards. “China’s craze for chic furniture is driving a multimillion black market trade in illegal logs\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009across the Mekong,”  Megan MacInnes, a campaigner at Global Witness. “China urgently needs to introduce regulations to stem the import of illegally sourced timber and help put an end to the trade’s legacy of violence, intimidation and environmental harm.” The flourishing trade risks raising geopolitical tensions through incidents such as the detention last month of more than 100 alleged Chinese loggers in the northern Myanmar state of Kachin, where timber is widely seen as a driver of conflict between government forces and ethnic militias. In Thailand, dozens of forest rangers have been killed or wounded in the past two  in firefights with Cambodian wood poachers. Thai authorities  last month they had intercepted a cargo of rosewood that had been sent to neighbouring Laos for false documentation, then shipped back to Thailand en route to China. The Laos state media played down the story, saying only a small amount of rosewood had been found. Efforts to protect the iconic Siamese rosewood by listing it two  ago as an internationally protected species, exportable only under licence, are failing in the face of a boom in demand for modern versions of intricate traditional Chinese furniture, environmental officials, activists and law enforcement agencies say. Prices for the rich redhued timber have soared as high as $50,000 per cubic metre. Available trade data, though patchy, suggest imports of luxury red woods such as rosewoods to China began to climb sharply in 2013. Tensions between Mekong countries and China broke to the surface at a regional meeting in December of law enforcement agencies, forestry officials and others involved in overseeing the protection of Siamese rosewood and other species, according to people who attended. While delegates from the Mekong states  Beijing needed to do more to cut demand, Chinese officials insisted the answer was better law enforcement in source countries. “The real battle is to make it socially unacceptable to consume these goods,”  one person who attended the talks. “It’s what has worked in Europe and North America.” Cites, the international organisation in charge of listing protected plant and animal species,  the trade in Siamese rosewood had escalated and needed to be dealt with urgently, not least by countries that import it. “It is lucrative and well organised and must be tackled in the same way as other transnational organised crimes,”  John Scanlon, the group’s secretarygeneral. Campaigners say another dimension of the problem is that governments such as Cambodia have chosen to ease rather than restrict exploitation of luxury timber. The Global Witness report alleges legal moves in Phnom Penh, such as turning protected areas into agricultural land concessions, have given Try Pheap, a local tycoon, a wide licence to exploit luxury timber, even extending to rights to buy up illegally logged rosewood seized by the authorities. Mr Try Pheap did not respond to a request for comment on the role law changes had played in helping him achieve his market position. Prak Vuthy, general manager of MDS Import Export, one of Mr Try Pheap’s companies,  the group was not involved in any wrongdoing. Phay Siphan, a Cambodian government spokesman, defended the rosewood rights granted to Mr Try Pheap. He  keeping the industry in the hands of one or two people made it easier for authorities to monitor it and collect any taxes due.',\n",

Negotiators from 12 Pacific countries hope to wrap up talks on the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) within months, but House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan  some countries might have to wait for the second round. \"For TPP, Japan and Canada just have to lower their agricultural tariffs,\" he  at an event hosted by the Washington International Trade Association. \"Those have to go. And if any of the 12 countries currently in the talks think our standards are too high, well, I\\'d complete the agreement without them and invite them to join it later.\" Ryan also  it was vital to pass legislation know as trade promotion authority (TPA) as soon as possible to streamline the passage of trade deals though Congress. Japan is eager to protect sectors including beef, sugar and dairy, although Japanese media have reported the government is considering concessions. Canada uses milk quotas and import tariffs to ensure steady prices for local farmers. U.S. dairy farmers cheered Ryan remarks. \"Too many times in the past, Canada has gotten a pass on its impenetrable tariff wall on dairy imports,\" National Milk Producers Federation President Jim Mulhern . Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, speaking on a conference call with reporters during a visit to Washington,  he was confident Canada would remain in the TPP. \"There a lot of pushing and shoving when you get to these steps in the negotiations.

Ritz, who has  it would take a \"sea shift\" for Canada to open its dairy, egg and poultry industries, noted the United States still had to reenact TPA, which expired in 2007. Under trade promotion authority, the executive branch negotiates, with Congress input, trade agreements. Once an agreement has been negotiated, under TPA it is fasttracked, meaning it cannot be amended by Congress and is subject to simple up or down votes in the House and Senate. \"At the end of the day of course everyone is looking at the ability of the American administration to push through with the TPA,\" he .',\n",

Leading critics of Mr. Obama trade policy, including labor leaders and Detroit auto industry, see the disturbing deficits as evidence that previous efforts to lower trade barriers have backfired. But the administration, backed by most Republican lawmakers, takes the opposite point of view: Officials say if trade barriers aren\\'t lowered further, it will be hard to boost exports and improve the balance of trade. The debate between the diametrically opposed viewpoints is heating up as the dollar strengthens against other currencies, as the U.S. seeks to sign the Pacific trade deal, and as more U.S. data show exports trailing behind imports.

The central bank also lifted its key interest rate from 14 per cent to 19.5 per cent as part of a monetary policy shift from defending the valuation of the hryvnia towards controlling inflation. The hryvnia nosedive coincided with an announcement that central bank foreign exchange reserves fell nearly 15 per cent last month to just $6.42bn far below the three months of import coverage considered sustainable by most economists. The developments thrust the wartorn and recessionbattered country one step closer to a financial meltdown and heightened urgency for a speedy approval of a fresh International Monetary Fund bailout. An IMF mission is at present in Kiev wrapping up discussion on a new assistance package. Speaking in Kiev on Thursday during talks with John Kerry, US secretary of state, Ukraine prowestern president Petro Poroshenko  he expected a visiting IMF mission to provide preliminary approval for a new programme \"in the next hours or days\". But any new financing programme for Ukraine would need support from the IMF board which Valeria Gontareva, Ukraine central bank chief,  on Thursday she expected within \"a minimum of two maximum of three weeks.\" In early 2014 the IMF extended a $17bn loan to Ukraine as the country slipped into recession and suffered a balance of payments crisis. Late last the IMF identified the need for an additional $15bn after Russianbacked rebel fighters seized much of the country industrial east which accounts for the equivalent of 15 per cent of the economy capacity. Last month the central bank revealed its foreign currency reserves had dropped from $16.3bn in May to just $9bn in November. The data also showed the value of its gold reserves had dropped by nearly half over the same period. A person with direct knowledge of the central bank policy  part of the drop had been due to largescale gold sales. Gerry Rice, an IMF spokesman, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that the fund supported all of the decisions announced by the central bank on Thursday. The National Bank of Ukraine in a statement on Thursday blamed the steep drop in reserves in January largely on servicing state and stateguaranteed foreign currency debt obligations amounting to $624.4m, including to the IMF. Interventions to defend the currency cost the central bank $518m in January, and $464m was sold to help Naftogaz, the struggling state energy company, fund imports of natural gas.

The dispatch noted that there is light at the end of the tunnel with the transmittal of a letter from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in May 20 I 4, couple with the the response from WTO Director Genera] Roberto Azevedo, and the submission of the key negotiation inputs to the WTO Secretariat, despite the Ebola Outbreak. The Commerce Ministry dispatch  these actions impressed on members the seriousness of Liberia intention to become the 161th member of the WTO. At the conclusion of the negotiations in midFebruary, Liberia intends to cautiously fast track its accession and beginning drafting the Working Party Report to fulfill the early accession harvest at the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Nairobi. Kenya in December 2015. Lastly, while on the mission, Minister Addy paid courtesy calls on MukhisaKituyi UNCTAD Secretary General, Dr. RatnakarAdhikari, ElF Executive Director, Coordinator Simon Hess of the EIF and Arancha Gonzalez, Executive Director, International Trade Center (ITC). It is  to stress that Liberia wouldbe membership to the W'l'O is  for investment in nontraditional sectors, like tourism, fisheries, education, and health to spur economic growth and development. Cape Verde and Cambodia, along with Rwanda, have demonstrated that accession to the WTO arid a predictable business environment are  elements for economic growth. The Liberian delegation, headed by Axel M Addy included Steve Marvie, Assistant Minister for Commerce and Trade, Mr. William Buku, Assistant Commissioner Operational Policy & International Relations of the Bureau of Customs & Excise, Liberia Revenue Authority, Atty. Roosevelt Gould, Legal Counsel at the Trade Ministry, Atty.

       " 'Effort to comply with WTO directive GOVERNMENT HAS OFFICIALLY informed the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that it is taking steps to end a number of subsidies which the WTO says is contravening its Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement. Nation News (Barbados) 6 February 2015 And based on what Government has outlined, it will mean legislative changes and agreements with companies expected to be affected by the changes. According to WTO documents made available last week, Government has been taking a number of internal steps, including finalisation of the preparation of a policy paper for discussion with the stakeholders, submission of the policy paper to the Cabinet for approval, issuance of instructions to the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to amend the legislation, submission of bills to Cabinet for approval, and submission to Parliament for debate and approval. The authorities indicated that processes would be completed in time for Barbados to honour its obligation to make these programmes WTOcompatible by December 2015, the WTO . In September 2013, Barbados informed WTO members that a position paper, detailing proposed recommendations on how to bring the offending programmes into line with the obligations of the SCM Agreement, had been circulated among the private and public sector stakeholders that would be affected by the removal of the prohibited programmes and that the ministry responsible for the coordination of the efforts towards the elimination of the prohibited subsidies had received their comments on the position paper. These comments and all proposed recommendations had been forwarded to the Office of the Solicitor General, with a view to determining any legal implications for the proposed recommendations. That ministry had also engaged with the Office of the Solicitor General to develop the most legallyappropriate way to formulate the proposed revisions. With respect to the Fiscal Incentives Act, as at late 2014 the Government has engaged in consultations with companies that have been granted benefits beyond December 31, 2015, to agree on some form of compensation, the WTO added.

       " 'Ryan Floats TPP Without Japan, Canada, As Both Withhold Sensitive Items Inside U.S. Trade 02/06/2015 House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (RWI) this week suggested leaving Japan and Canada out of a final TransPacific Partnership (TPP) agreement if they do not sufficiently lower import barriers on sensitive agriculture products. \"So for TPP, Japan and Canada just have to lower their agricultural tariffs,\" he  in a Feb. 5 prepared speech to the Washington International Trade Association, flagging high Japanese tariffs and Canadian restrictions on dairy, poultry, and egg products. \"Those have to go. And if any of the 12 countries currently in the talks think our standards are too high, well, I\\'d complete the agreement without them and invite them to join it later,\" Ryan . Ryan comments come as Japan and Canada are continuing to hold off on making tariff offers to all TPP countries on their most sensitive products, although Japan in recent weeks has vastly improved the quality of its offers for a number of negotiating partners, sources . Canada tariff offer is the lowest quality out of all TPP countries, and in some cases it is offering less market access than it has in its bilateral free trade agreements with TPP countries, these sources charged. Japan, by contrast, is withholding making offers on a few of its most sensitive products that are still not settled in the U.S.Japan bilateral market access negotiation, according to these sources. Some sources say Japan has indicated it will extend the treatment that it gives to the United States to all TPP countries, although other industry sources remain doubtful that this will be the case for such products as dairy. But these products on which Japan is holding out are not of interest to all TPP countries. As a result, some countries consider their bilateral market access with Tokyo to be concluded, sources . One industry source  that, in addition to the U.S., New Zealand and Canada have likely not concluded their bilateral talks with Japan. Overall, TPP negotiators who met for an informal round in New York City last week did not resolve the most difficult outstanding issues in the talks, such intellectual property (IP) protection for medicines, stateowned enterprises (SOEs) and textiles, sources . Even the relatively less controversial issue of whether a TPP agreement would impose a blanket ban on agricultural export subsidies was not resolved in New York, sources . The U.S. had indicated ahead of the round that it was willing to agree to an unconditional and complete ban on agricultural export subsidies if other negotiating partners dropped their demands for new disciplines for export credits (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan. 30). One source  some negotiating groups SOEs likely among them will hold additional meetings prior to a TPP ministerial planned for the middle of March at which the U.S. is aiming to conclude the talks. Another source  there will also be additional bilateral engagements ahead of the ministerial, the location of which had not been finalized. Officials close to the negotiations this week gave differing assessments of how long it would take to conclude a TPP agreement. Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb  in a Feb. 5 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the timeframe negotiators are looking at for concluding the TPP is \"midFebruary to midMarch,\" according to a transcript posted on his website. But Chilean Ambassador to the U.S. Juan Gabriel Valdes  at a Feb. 5 event at the Atlantic Council in Washington that, in his opinion, \"months of work\" remain to conclude a TPP deal. Another source close to the negotiations estimated there is a 70 percent chance that the agreement will be concluded at the midMarch ministerial. Robb acknowledged that TPP countries might not be able to close all outstanding issues prior to midMarch.\"MidFebruary to midMarch. That will be I think the time frame,\" he . \"We might have to come back again to conclude some things but that the intent. It really is a vital time.\" \"We have sort of concluded that that would be the best time if we can manage it. There are still some, not many, but the final issues as always are the most difficult, but everyone seems to be in a mood to find some common ground so that we can get this really major agreement off the ground,\" Robb added. Two major U.S. dairy groups the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) and the U.S. Dairy Export Council (USDEC) welcomed Ryan comments on Canada and Japan, even as USDEC President Tom Suber noted that significant progress had made in the U.S.Japan market access talks. \"We appreciate the intense trade negotiations now under way between the United States and Japan and believe significant progress has been made in those talks,\" Suber  in a statement. \"But there still is work to do. Japan ongoing efforts to limit meaningful market access on key U.S. dairy products are not in keeping with a trade agreement designed to expand trade opportunities.\" In the same statement, NMPF President and CEO Jim Mulhern  it \"is time Canada provides significant market access on all dairy products, from cheese to butter to milk.\" He added that, too many times in the past, \"Canada has gotten a pass on its impenetrable tariff wall on dairy imports.\" Canada ambassador to the United States this week implicitly rejected the notion that his country is holding up the TPP negotiations by failing to engage on agricultural market access (see related story).

On October 18 last , the Directorate General of AntiDumping and Allied Duties (DGAD), an arm of the Commerce Ministry, had begun investigations into allegations of dumping of electronic calculators by Chinese firms. Normally, the authority completes an investigation within 150 days of the date of initiation of the probe. Ajanta Ltd, a leading producer of electronic calculators in the country, had filed the application for the probe on behalf of the domestic industry. The DGAD had  that the authority has found sufficient prima facie evidence of dumping of calculators from China. The period of investigation was from April 2012 to March 2013. However, for the purpose of analysing injury, the data of previous three  of 20092010, 20102011 and 201112 would also be considered. After completion of the probe, the DGAD, if needed, would recommend the duty and the Finance Ministry would impose it. Countries initiate an antidumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of surge in cheap imports of any product. As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of the WTO. The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a levelplaying field for domestic producers visavis foreign producers and exporters resorting to dumping. India has initiated as many as 159 antidumping investigation cases since 1992 against China, with which it has a huge trade deficit of about USD 37 billion in 201314. The bilateral trade between the countries stood at USD 65.85 billion in 201314. Major items of India exports to China include raw cotton and yarn, iron ore, minerals, plastic, spices, machinery, petroleum. Import products include electric goods, machinery, chemicals, project goods, fertiliser, iron and steel, transport equipment and electric machinery. PTI RR MR',\n",
       " 'OECD Prepares to Close Tax Loophole Update 6 February 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News Preparations for an overhaul of the international tax system to make it more difficult for companies to shift profits to lowtax countries advanced on Friday, with an agreement to launch talks on modifying more than 3,000 bilateral tax treaties, and on ways to ensure companies accurately measure the cost of goods and services transferred between the countries in which they operate. Launched by the Group of 20 largest economies and members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2013, the planned overhaul is intended to close loopholes that allow companies to adopt legal structures and practices designed to shift their profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions, regardless of where those profits are generated. \"These are  steps forward, which demonstrate that progress is being made toward a fairer international tax system,\" OECD SecretaryGeneral Angel Gurra . \"These decisions signal the unwavering commitment of the international community to put an end to base erosion and profit shifting, in line with the ambitious timeline endorsed by G20 leaders.\" In September 2014, the 44 countries involved in developing the new tax rules agreed on a template for countrybycountry reporting by companies, which will require them to report the amount of revenue, profit and tax paid in each jurisdiction, as well as their total employment, capital and assets used in each location. Critics of the new process feared the costs would be too high to bear for smaller companies, and guidelines for implementing the rules announced on Friday exempt companies with annual turnover of less than EUR750 million ($858 million). But the regular sharing of such detailed operational information across a number of jurisdictions poses other potential problems for companies.',\n",

The global economy was at risk of being stuck in its postcrisis doldrums, Christine Lagarde wrote in a blog post. \"Without action, we could see the global economic supertanker continuing to be stuck in the shallow waters of subpar growth and meagre job creation,\"  the IMF managing director. The call for greater action comes ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers due to begin on Monday in Istanbul. Concerns about slow global growth and the risk of a resumption of the euro crisis over Greece and its new government insistence on debt relief will take centre stage at the talks. G20 leaders committed in November to a \"growth agenda\" that Ms Lagarde  would add $2tn to the global economy if implemented. But since that pledge the IMF has downgraded its growth forecasts for this  to 3.5 per cent and warned downside risks remained. Ms Lagarde cautioned again of what she called the \"asynchronous monetary policy\" in the world with the US Federal Reserve \"normalising\" its policy while many others, including the European Central Bank, were increasing monetary stimulus. \"Even if this process is well managed, it may result in excessive volatility in financial markets as investors reassess their perception of risk,\" Ms Lagarde wrote. The strengthening of the US dollar, based in part on the expectation that the Fed would move this  to increase interest rates for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, also posed a risk, she . That applied particularly to emerging market economies, which were \"especially vulnerable because, over the past five , many of their banks and companies have increased their borrowing in dollars\". <>The former French finance minister also warned that the eurozone and Japan risked remaining trapped in a \"twilight zone of low growth and low inflation for a prolonged period\", something that increased the risk of recession and deflation. \"This all points to the need for a more powerful policy mix\" and the need for increased structural reforms that would eventually encourage growth and more investment, particularly in infrastructure, Ms Lagarde . In a separate briefing note prepared for the G20 ministers, IMF economists  that while the fall in oil prices would boost the global economy it would be \"more than offset\" by a drag on investment caused by concerns about the world mediumterm growth prospects. They also repeated a December warning that the fall in oil prices had heightened risks to global financial stability. This was particularly the case in many of the same emerging economies where the rise in the dollar already presented a risk because of the high levels of dollardenominated debt mentioned by Ms Lagarde. \"If sustained, the decline in oil prices could have a material impact on banks with high dollar and energy sector exposures, particularly in emerging economies where [currency] depreciations have already been substantial,\" the economists wrote. \"Given global financial linkages, these developments demand increased vigilance all around.\"',\n",
       " 'Isolated Greece rejects bailout extension By Lefteris Papadimas and Jan Strupczewski ATHENS/BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) Greece new leftistled government, isolated in the euro zone and under pressure from the European Central Bank, vowed on Friday not to accept any deal in crunch talks next week that keeps its current international bailout programme in place. Instead, a government official  Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis would ask for a \"bridge agreement\" to keep state finances running until Athens can present a new debt and reform programme. \"We will not accept any deal which is not related to a new programme,\"  the official, who asked not to be named. Varoufakis returned emptyhanded from a tour of European capitals in which even leftleaning governments in France and Italy insisted Greece must stick to commitments made to the European Union and International Monetary Fund and rejected any debt writeoff. Euro zone finance ministers will discuss how to proceed with financial support for Athens at a special session next Wednesday ahead of the first summit of EU leaders with new Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras the following day. Participants  no progress was made at a preparatory meeting of senior finance ministry officials in Brussels on Thursday because Greece and its euro zone partners were so far apart. \"It was Greece against all others, basically one versus 18,\" one official . Athens\\' partners broadly lined up in support of a hardline German document rejecting any rollback of reforms or commitments made by previous Greek governments. Tsipras and his ministers promised in their first days in office to raise the minimum wage, rehire some sacked government employees and stop some privatisations. This clashed with conditions set by the International Monetary Fund and euro zone countries, which have lent Athens a total of 240 billion euros ($270 billion). U.S. WEIGHS IN Adding to pressure on Tsipras, the United States told Greece through its ambassador on Friday to work cooperatively with European partners and the IMF and \"exercise fiscal prudence\". The new premier will need to tread a fine line when he delivers a policy speech to parliament on Sunday and seeks a vote of confidence on Tuesday. The ECB raised the stakes this week by deciding to bar Greek banks from using Greek government bonds as collateral to borrow from the central bank as long as there is no prospect of an agreed bailout programme. That makes lenders dependent on more costly emergency liquidity from the Greek central bank, which the ECB can stop at any time. Greek bank shares fell further on Friday at the end of a week of wild trading swings, as brokers cut their forecasts on worries over dwindling deposits and brinkmanship between Athens and its creditors. Portugal, which emerged from its own EU/IMF bailout last , joined a chorus of countries insisting that Greece must stick to the austerity medicine as Lisbon had done and respect past agreements with EU partners. Portuguese Economy Minister Antonio Pires de Lima rejected any kind of debt renegotiation for Greece, saying Athens must play by the rules established by euro members, especially considering his own country sacrifices. He told the Reuters Euro Zone Summit that Lisbon had chosen a route \"which was not the easiest one\" to recover credibility and return to growth, and \"that is also our attitude to the situation in other countries\". The Portuguese minister  he was not concerned about any risk of contagion from Greece to his own country, pointing to Lisbon bond yields which are now trading near record lows. \"The project of the single currency is not at risk,\" he . \"At the end of the day, Greece is master of its own destiny.\" The Greek official  Varoufakis was expecting tough treatment from his partners at next Wednesday meeting, including a demand to extend the existing bailout programme, which expires at the end of February. This is anathema to the Greek government, led by Tsipras\\' leftwing Syriza party, that came to power on a wave of antiausterity anger in elections last month. Euro zone officials say Greece is free to design its own reforms in line with Syriza campaign promises, as long as the result is in line with commitments to stronger public finances, debt repayment and reforms. \"The overall policy mix may reflect the priorities of Syriza. But it has to make sense financially,\" a second official . Time to reach a deal is short. Some analysts say Greece could run out of cash as early as March without further euro zone help. \"Greece financing needs over the next five  may amount to 3035 billion euros,\" Unicredit bank  in a research note. \"However, if we set the primary surplus at 11.5 percent of GDP and assume that privatisations will stop, as requested by the Greek government, overall financing needs would rise to 60 billion euros,\" Unicredit . Both Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank  their base case was that Greece would remain in the euro zone, but a rise in deposit outflows had raised risks of a crisis.

       " 'TTIP talks Africa remains left out 6 February 2015 Deutsche Welle The EU and the US are negotiating their proposed free trade agreement behind closed doors. Third countries, for instance in Africa, have no say in these talks, although the deal could have a farreaching impact on them. It would be the largest free trade zone in the world The TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the EU and the US, which jointly account for a third of global commerce. The proposed pact is expected to raise percapita income worldwide by some 3 percent, according to various estimates. In Germany, for instance, the deal is projected to usher in an income rise of 3.5 percent. However, not all regions worldwide are believed to benefit from such a development, with percapita income in many African nations estimated to decline by similar levels. A crucial role is played in each country costsversusbenefits balance from TTIP by the composition of its goods and services exports, and the intensity of its trade ties with Europe and the US,  Gabriel Felbermayr, professor at the Munichbased Ifo Institute. Felbermayr and his colleagues at the institute have conducted research on the likely impact of the trade deal on developing countries. Whether the deal will have a positive or a negative impact on African economies will be determined by the final wording of the agreement, Felbermayr . African value added under pressure At a first glance, the pact doesn\\'t appear to have an affect on exporters of unprocessed products and raw materials. In a country like Ivory Coast, for instance, exports to TTIP states make up around a quarter of the nation gross domestic product. The African country coffee and cocoa, in particular, find their way onto dining tables in the US and Europe. The trade deal may not change this, since neither the US nor Europe grow these products. The socalled rules of origin, however, could make it hard for countries like Ivory Coast to export processed goods. These rules, for example, require that at least 50 percent of the value added of a product must be produced in a TTIP state, in order to benefit from tariff reductions. If Ivory Coast processes cocoa beans to chocolate by itself, then it could find fewer customers due to the strict rules of origin. For German companies, it would be cheaper to process cocoa in Europe and then export to the US. \"There is a danger that developing countries would either be forced out of Western supply chains, or TTIP would at least make their access to these value chains difficult,\" Felbermayr told DW. The gradual industrialization of Africa, which is a way out of poverty for millions, could therefore be jeopardized. The impact spreads across sectors and countries ranging from Ivory Coast chocolate industry to textiles from Kenya and Ethiopia, and automotive components from South Africa. It would therefore be good for these countries if the negotiation parties were to agree to broaden the rules of origin as far as possible,  economist Felbermayr. It would also benefit many European companies, which have a large part of their production base in countries outside of the EU and the US, he noted. Avoiding discriminatory standards Furthermore, it is  that the product standards, which TTIP would harmonize between the US and the EU, should also apply to products from third countries,  Felbermayr, underlining that these standards should not be discriminatory. \"For instance, if Kenya exports green beans and other vegetables to Europe that are in accordance with EU standards in terms of pesticide exposure, for example then this compliance with EU standards should suffice for Kenya to export them also to the US,\" he suggested. This is, however, not guaranteed, he , since TTIP under the current draft of the agreement mainly looks at whether the product concerned is made in the EU or in the US. Feldmayr stressed that TTIP negotiators should be pressured to also take the interests of third countries into consideration. WTO is being bypassed Countries such as Kenya, which with its beaches and national parks lure thousands of Western tourists, could benefit from the deal. When the TTIP leads to increased prosperity in Europe and the US, then people would be more willing to holiday in these places and buy more products from them. The pact would have both positive and negative effects for Africa, indicated Felbermayr. \"There are some countries that are more at risk because of the mix of goods they produce. And other countries that rely more on sectors such as mining and tourism are more likely to benefit,\" he . Kenyan economist David Owiro of the Institute of Economic Affairs terms the proposed agreement as \"unfair.\" The deal that the EU and the US are negotiating has a global impact, but the rest of the world has no say in these talks, Owiro . \"These talks should take place in a multilateral framework such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) where developing countries at least have a formal say,\" he . The TTIP can be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the WTO. Still, it might be possible to influence the ongoing TTIP negotiations for the benefit of Africa, say experts. \"It would be entirely legitimate for developing countries to be involved in the discussions about the positive and negative consequences of the deal, and to be allowed to make recommendations,\" Owiro told DW. This view is shared by economist Felbermayr. There should be a right to information for developing countries so that they know what the two sides across the Atlantic are negotiating about. \"What is needed is a proper dose of good will on the part of the EU and the US,\" he suggested.',\n",

       " 'India promises preferential market access to services suppliers from LDCs D. Ravi Kanth 7 February 2015 Mint Geneva, Feb. 7 India has promised preferential market access for services suppliers from the poorest countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO)an offer that has enhanced New Delhi image as a generous partner of the least developed countries (LDCs) in global trade. The India offer includes market access for shortterm contractual services suppliers and independent professions (what is called Mode 4 supply of services in trade jargon) in sectors such as engineering services, integrated engineering services, computer and related services and management consulting services. The offer also includes access to project management services other than for construction, hotel and other lodging services, travel agency and tour operator services and a quota of 250 tourist guides in nonEnglish foreign languages. New Delhi has announced that it will waive the visa fee for applicants from these countries applying for India business or employment visas. High visa fee in industrialized countries is one of the biggest barriers for services suppliers from the poorest nations. At a highlevel meeting convened by WTO on Thursday for implementing what is called the waiver for preferential treatment to services providers from these nations, India generous and substantive offer seemed several notches ahead of what industrialized countries announced to assist the poorest countries, several trade envoys . As part of the Bali ministerial declaration, trade ministers had directed industrialized countries and developing countries to indicate what they are willing to offer to LDCs at a highlevel meeting. \"India made an excellent offer to provide substantial market access and also technical assistance to train our services suppliers in different sectors,\"  the LDC coordinator, ambassador Christopher Onyanga Aparr of Uganda. Aparr  he was disappointed with offers from some industrialized countries, describing them as empty promises. \"India made most creative statement to operationalize the LDC waiver by offering access in a range of sectors coupled with the promise to build the supplyside capacitybuilding,\" an industrialized country official  on condition of anonymity. As part of technical assistance and capacity building to enable LDCs to supply quality services, India will train financial candidates from LDCs at the Reserve Bank of India and also \"conduct specially designed course for around 1,000 LDC professional each  in areas such as Management Consulting, Technical Consulting, and Project Management\". New Delhi will also accord priority to training LDC professionals and consultants in areas such as insurance services, promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and rural development sectors, and railway infrastructure services. India will assist LDCs to promote their trade and tourism exports along with creative industry services such as audiovisual coproduction agreements. Besides India, China, Mexico, the European Union (EU), Canada, Australia, Norway, Japan and Switzerland, among others, made several offers in different sectors, particularly areas concerning shortterm services providers, and technical assistance and capacitybuilding. The US, however, took a back seat by saying it would need time to learn from the highlevel meeting before making any concrete offers,  participants at the meeting. \"I\\'m encouraged by the overall positive response from the developed and developing countries to address the two issuesmarket access and capacitybuilding and technical assistancefor services providers in the least developed countries,\" the chair for the council for trade in services, ambassador Choi Seokyoung, .

       " 'India offers to waive off visa fees to LDCs at WTO meet From Shreerupa Mitra Jha Geneva, Feb 8 (PTI) India has made substantial offers like waiving off visa fees, granting market access and technical assistance to service providers from poor nations, showing its resolve to support the Least Developing Countries. The offers were made at a highlevel WTO meeting here convened to indicate proposals from developed and developing countries for preferential treatment to service providers from the Least Developing Countries (LDCs). Among major concessions and offers, India proposed to waive off visa fees for applicants applying for India business or employment from LDCs. High visa fees is one of the biggest impediments for service providers from the poorer nations. \"Onerous application fees for visas, licenses and residence and work permits for many LDCs are tantamount to one months salary for the families. Also, a severe loss if the visa is not granted and the fees are not returned,\"  Uganda Minister of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives Amelia Anne Kyambadde. \"Visa waiver is a really good thing if India does it in practice,\"  LDC coordinator and Ugandan Ambassador Christopher Onyanga Aparr. Also, the India offers made in Thursday meeting includes market access, capacity building and technical assistance to service providers from poor nations. The offer is specific to the requests made by LDCs in July 2014. The sectors for preferential treatment in market access, under General Agreement and Trade in Services plus new mode 4 commitments contractual service suppliers and independent professionals are engineering services and management consulting services (excluding services in legal consultancy). In addition, computer and related services, integrated engineering services, hotel and lodging services, travel agency and tour operator services and project management services other than construction are part of GATS. An exclusive quota of 250 is for tourist guides from the LDCs. Some of the 15 subsectors with which India will engage with LDCs were not included in earlier GATS commitments. Under the technical assistance support, India will earmark at least 25 per cent of all technical assistance offered by Ministry of External Affairs exclusively for LDC members, among other proposals. India will also design courses for about 1,000 LDC professionals every , which will be conducted in India or any LDC country, in areas such as management consulting, technical consulting, project management etc.',\n",
       " 'EU tightens seal ban rules QMI AGENCY 7 February 2015 The Toronto Sun The European Union announced Friday plans to toughen its 2009 ban of commercial seal hunt products. Last May, Canada lost its challenge of a World Trade Organization ruling that upheld the EU ban on the trade of seal skins, furs and other products. The EU banned those products because of animal welfare concerns. But the WTO Appellate Body concluded exceptions for Inuit and other indigenous hunts, as well as for maritime resource management, had some discriminatory effects. The new proposals try to remedy that by removing the exception for skins, furs and products that result from marine resource management while still recognizing the importance of seal population management hunts and increasing oversight of products brought in under the traditional Inuit hunt exceptions. Canada and Norway have repeatedly challenged the EU ban, arguing the hunt is humane. Humane Society International applauded the proposals as a victory for animal welfare. The EU has to officially adopt the proposals by October to comply with WTO rules.',\n",

The EU signed a law in late 2013 granting Pakistan socalled \"GSPplus\" status, which means firms pay no tax on certain categories of goods exported to the 27nation bloc for 10 . The EU makes GSPplus conditional on implementing international conventions on human and labour rights, and there have been fears Pakistan decision to end a moratorium on executions could affect the deal. Pakistan key textile industry in particular welcomed the agreement, which came into force in January 2014, and in an interview with AFP commerce minister Khurram Dastgir Khan hailed its impact. \"As a result of GSPplus, Pakistan exports to the EU have increased by $1.08 billion during the period January to October 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013,\" Khan . Exports to the EU in JanuaryOctober 2014 totalled $6.38 billion, up by just over 20 percent from the $5.3 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2013, he . Before GSPplus, textile exports faced customs tariffs of between 6.4 and 12 percent and leather goods and footwear up to six percent, he . The textile industry is the backbone of Pakistan exports, making up more than 50 percent of the country total overseas shipments. \"Now these exports have dutyfree access in EU and it has helped Pakistani products to become more competitive visavis its competitors, including Bangladesh, India and Vietnam,\" he . Khan played down the possibility that resuming executions could threaten GSPplus status. \"There is no legal obligation to EU regarding death penalty, though they have expressed concern over it,\" Khan . \"They understand our situation that GSPplus would help us create jobs and when we create jobs, it keeps young men and women away from terrorism.\" Pakistan has executed 22 convicts since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a six death penalty moratorium in the wake of a Taliban massacre at a school. Heavilyarmed gunmen murdered 153 people, including 134 children, at the school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in Pakistan deadliest ever terror attack. Opposition to the death penalty is a key EU policy and the bloc mission in Islamabad condemned the resumption of executions in December. But EU diplomats in Islamabad have  that while they are concerned about the return to hangings, the development was unlikely to affect the GSPplus arrangement immediately. Improving the economy after  of drift and sluggish growth under the last Pakistan People Party government was a key pledge in Sharif election campaign in 2013, when he was swept to power for a third term. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  this week the government reform programme tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washingtonbased lender was on track. \"Economic activity and the external position continue to improve, driven by prudent monetary and fiscal policies and helped by lower oil prices and robust remittances,\" IMF mission chief Jeffrey Franks . Growth for 201415 is expected to hit 4.3 percent and the budget deficit for endDecember was below the target, the IMF . But the government has so far struggled to improve a longrunning energy crisis, with hourslong electricity blackouts still a neardaily reality. Power and gas shortages have hampered industry and held back GDP growth, which experts say needs to hit seven percent in order to provide enough jobs for new entrants to the workforce. Projects to boost electricity production are in the pipeline, including a 6,600megawatt coalfired energy park along the Arabian Sea coast west of Karachi, but these have yet to yield results.',\n",

But now Brits living in the US will have to settle for what some regard as inferior American versions of chocolate after the confectionery giant Hershey forced two companies to stop importing UKmade versions. The spat is part of a war of trademark claims that involves products by Cadbury and Nestl, the worlds biggest chocolate makers with British tastebuds caught in the crossfire. Nicola Edwards runs The Queens Grocer, a store in Odenton, Maryland, that sells tea, biscuits and Doctor Who memorabilia to the local British population. The expat from Leicester kept her taste for British confectionery when she moved to the US 15  ago, and says Hersheys Cadbury is barely worth calling chocolate. Its brown, and thats about it, she . Her petition protesting against Hersheys actions has attracted more than 30,000 signatures online. Her stores supply of Britishmade Cadbury, which is owned by Mondelez, formerly called Kraft, and Toffee Crisp, Rolo, Yorkie and Kit Kat brands owned by Nestl is fast running out after Hershey blocked two US companies from importing them, claiming that the products infringed its trademarks. Although she does not purchase directly from Posh Nosh Imports and LBB Imports, the companies Hershey took to court last , she says her suppliers do not want to face similar legal action by a billiondollar company. Hersheys claim stemmed from exclusive licensing deals it agreed with Cadbury and Rowntree, which was later purchased by Nestl, in the 1970s and 1980s. Hershey makes Cadburys chocolate and Nestles Kit Kat and Rolo in the US, albeit with a slightly different recipe to cater to American tastes. We undeniably own those trademark rights, it . Although Britishmade Cadbury products have been imported to the US for , Hershey took action in 2014 because they were appearing in mainstream retailers, which Hershey declined to name. The company, which won an injunction last  against Steve Hershey, the US senator, for allegedly imitating its branding on his campaign posters, also argued that Nestls Toffee Crisp packaging too closely resembled its Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, and that the name Yorkie was too similar to its peppermint patty brand York. LBB settled out of court and agreed to stop importing the products, while Posh Nosh lost its case in November. John Baumgartner, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities,  the dispute was an openandshut case. Hershey has the rights to sell Cadburys chocolate in the US. Theres not much leeway on that, he . Posh Nosh declined to comment and an LBB spokesman was unavailable for comment. Both Nestl and Mondelez distanced themselves from the spats, describing them as legal disputes between third parties. However, Nestl  it did sell directly to Posh Nosh Imports, albeit in insignificant amounts when compared with its 400m of annual exports. Mondelez  ingredients for Hersheys Cadbury chocolate were supplied from its Irish chocolate factory, to maintain the same taste. Nestl  that its products were completely different in different markets to reflect local tastes and regulations. Nestl  on Thursday that it was investing 5.25m at its Halifax factory to manufacture more than 5,000 tonnes of Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cups. The product is for export to the US to compete with Hershey on its home turf. Brad Armitage, who runs American Fizz, a candy shop in Bournemouth that caters to American expats, criticised Hersheys actions. He  both Reeses Peanut Butter Cups and Toffee Crisp sat sidebyside on shelves in the UK. Were able to decipher which is which. Are they saying American people cant tell? he . It was still possible to buy Britishmade chocolates for delivery in the US on Amazon, he pointed out. Despite stocking more than 3,000 types of confectionery from the US, Mr Armitage, who is from the UK, admitted that he was not a devoted fan of American candy, particularly Hersheys chocolate. Its an acquired taste, he . While Hershey has been on the offensive against Britishmade chocolate, it has been forced to defend its Malteser brand, which effectively acts as a block on the sale of Marss Maltesers product in the US. Mars took Hershey to court last April in a case, still running, over Hersheys Malteser confectionery, which consists of crunchy chocolatecovered balls in red packaging. Mars declined to comment. Nathan Dulley, president of LLB,  his company would survive the loss of income from the block on imports.

More than two dozen WTO members agreed to grant favorable treatment to the WTO 48 LDC members as to multiple services sectors and modes of supply, WTO officials  at a Feb. 6 press briefing. Council for Trade in Services Chairman Choi Seokyoung of Korea commended the “very high level of engagement” on the issue and described the meeting as an  “stepping stone towards operationalization” of the LDC services waiver, according to his prepared remarks. Members will resume their discussions at the next Trade in Services Council meeting scheduled for March 19. Sectors and Modes of Supply The meeting builds on an agreement forged at the WTO eighth Ministerial Conference in 2011, whereby nonLDC members were permitted to grant all LDC greater access to their services markets. The agreement failed to propel any concrete results until LDC members submitted a collective request last  to indicate the services sectors and modes of supply to which they wanted preferential access. At the Feb. 5 meeting, numerous delegations  that they were willing to provide improved access in modes 1, 2 and 3, including few restrictions on the following services sectors: professional services, information technology and computer services, other business services, construction services, distribution services, financial services, transport and logistics services, tourism services, and recreational and sporting services. Other categories under mode 4 include the expansion of access for the temporary movement of LDC businesspeople, the waiving of fees for business and employment visas for LDC persons, the waiving of economic needs and labor market tests for LDC members and the extension of the duration of stay of LDC professionals for certain markets. Such preferential treatment would be implemented once these members have completed their domestic processes and notified the WTO.

Also this week, the European Union will lead the 11th round of negotiations on the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) from Feb. 913. Separately, the WTO Government Procurement Committee will discuss China, Ukraine and Moldova bids to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) at a meeting scheduled for Feb. 11. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo and the chairs of the WTO various trade negotiating groups plan to continue intensive consultations aimed at advancing a work program to resolve the remaining issues of the Doha Round. TiSA Talks Continue When TiSA negotiators last met, they discussed a draft proposal offered by Turkey to incorporate health services into the agreement. The proposal seeks to establish a structure that permits patients to seek authorized healthcare services in other TiSA countries and receive reimbursement for the cost of such treatments in their home country. “There is a huge untapped potential for the globalization of healthcare services even though it is being reflected in the growing crossborder delivery of health services through movement of consumers (patients), personnel or by electronic means,” according to a leaked copy of the proposal. The trading partners currently participating in TiSA negotiations are: Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the European Union, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the U.S. The U.S. recently sought comment on adding Uruguay to the list of negotiating members (242 WTO, 12/17/14). GPA Talks Resume China latest revised proposal to open its state procurement market to foreign bidders will lead the Government Procurement Committee Feb. 11 discussions. Last month, China offered several improvements in its latest bid, including lowered thresholds at which GPA levels would apply to procurement contracts and increased entity coverage (3 WTO, 1/6/15). Current members—including the U.S. and the European Union— the offer does not go far enough and will likely encourage China to expand its list of GPAcompliant stateowned enterprises, among other issues. China agreed in 2001 to accede to the GPA, which sets out rules guaranteeing fair conditions of international competition for government procurement contracts and prohibiting discriminatory treatment between local and foreign suppliers as well as between foreign suppliers from different countries. Ukraine, Moldova GPA Bids GPA members will discuss Ukraine second revised GPA offer, which a handful of European members recently commended as a “major step” in its bid to accede to the agreement. Members  they are optimistic that Ukraine accession could be concluded sometime in the first half of 2015, according to the Government Procurement Committee latest report. GPA members will also consider approving Moldova bid to join the GPA. There are 43 parties to the GPA, including: Armenia; Canada; the European Union, with its 28 member states; Hong Kong; Iceland; Israel; Japan; Korea; Liechtenstein; the Netherlands with respect to Aruba; Norway; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan; and the U.S. China, Ukraine and Moldova are among 10 WTO members that have started the process of acceding to the GPA, including: Albania, Georgia, Jordan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Oman and Ukraine. Last , GPA members invited Montenegro and New Zealand to join the agreement.

       " 'Obama to raise trade talk concerns with Merkel Shawn Donnan, World Trade Editor 9 February 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) US President Barack Obama is expected to raise concerns about the pace of transAtlantic trade talks with Angela Merkel when the German chancellor visits Washington on Monday with US officials fretting that supposedly reinvigorated negotiations are instead getting off to a false start. Following the November appointment of Cecilia Malmstrom, the new European trade commissioner, both sides pledged a \"fresh start\" to talks over a TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, that had been crawling along since beginning in July 2013. But a senior US official told the Financial Times that Washington was disappointed with the progress made in last week round of formal negotiations, the first since the relaunch, and had decided to press its case with Ms Merkel on Monday and in European capitals in the coming weeks. That frustration was partly in evidence in Brussels last week. \"This week round was constructive, but we do need to see more, further concrete progress ... if we are to turn this fresh start into a reality,\" the chief US negotiator, Dan Mullaney, told reporters on Friday as the discussions wrapped up. The US has in recent months been pressing the European Union to agree to exchange new offers on the number of tarifffree goods. Many see this as the easier part of the negotiations compared with the more complex question of easing regulatory barriers to trade across the Atlantic. Last  the US offered to eliminate tariffs on 88 per cent of goods traded between the two economies, significantly lower than the 96 per cent put forward by the EU. But since then US officials have been trying to improve their offer while also extracting more from the EU. Liberalisation of services is another bone of contention for Washington, which is irked that the EU has refused to offer a similar package to that negotiated with Canada in a recently concluded trade agreement. The decision to raise the issue with Ms Merkel did not reflect any conflict between the German chancellor and Mr Obama over TTIP, the official . Washington remains convinced she supports the transAtlantic talks, in spite of scepticism among many Germans. The concerns were instead focused on EU officials and the European Commission, the senior US official , and whether officials in Brussels were meeting their leaders\\' desire for more rapid progress. Mr Cameron last  called for \"rocket boosters\" to be placed under the talks. Two senior EU trade officials on Sunday dismissed the US concerns as \"spin\" and told the FT that they hoped to exchange new tariffs and services offers by July. The EU officials also  that there had been progress over the issue of financial services regulation in TTIP, something the US side has resisted in part because of fears that it might water down the strict DoddFranck regulations introduced in the wake of the 2008 crisis. But the disagreement highlights how tensions remain between both sides despite efforts to make a fresh start. European officials have also privately raised concerns that Mr Obama administration is more focused on sealing a 12country Pacific Rim trade agreement now nearing conclusion, the TransPacific Partnership, or TPP, than the transAtlantic one. Speaking at a security conference in Munich on Saturday, Vice President Joe Biden sought to placate the EU. \"TTIP is not the stepchild to TPP,\" the vice president . \"We have not taken our focus off of Europe. We have not decided that the future lies in the Pacific Basin. We are a Pacific power. We will assert that power, and we will remain a Pacific power. But we are also an Atlantic power.\"',\n",
       " 'China exports fall as trade surplus hits record Charles Clover in Beijing Financial Times February 8, 2015 9:32 am China’s slumping economy hit trade in January. Imports and exports came in worse than anticipated and the monthly trade surplus bulged to a record $60bn as a survey published on Sunday revealed that manufacturing, a key sector to the Chinese economy, contracted in January for the first time in more than two . China’s exports fell 3.3 per cent in January from a  earlier, while imports slumped by 19.9 per cent, according to data released on Sunday by the Customs Administration. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to rise by 6.3 per cent and imports to fall only 3 per cent, to give a trade deficit of $48.9bn. The majority of the slump in imports was the result of falling commodity prices, especially coal and oil, according to analysts at ANZ Research. China’s iron ore imports and crude oil imports fell by 9.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively by volume. However, in value terms, iron ore imports dropped by 50.3 per cent and crude oil imports declined by 41.8 per cent. The data reflect the cooling of China’s economic growth engine — last  the country’s gross domestic product grew at its slowest rate in more than two decades. “China’s manufacturing sector is under great pressure as both external and domestic demand remains sluggish,”  ANZ in a statement. However, analysts say strong seasonal distortions due to the Lunar New Year holiday — where consumption usually spikes and production falls — make it difficult to interpret January trade numbers. Last  the holiday fell in January, and this  it falls in February. The ballooning trade surplus would normally be expected to support renminbi appreciation but the currency in fact weakened in January by 0.7 per cent, reflecting investmentrelated outflows. The latest balance of payments data show that China posted its biggest quarterly capital and financial account deficit on record in the fourth quarter last , a trend that is likely to have continued in January. China suffered its largest capital outflows on record in the fourth quarter last , according to balance of payments data released on Tuesday. The deficit of $91bn on the capital and financial accounts was the worst since quarterly data were first compiled in 1998. Policy makers have responded to the weakness in the economy by cutting interest rates, and last week the central bank cut the required reserve ratio for its banks as it stepped up efforts to counter the impact of capital outflows and encourage banks to boost lending amid fresh data showing a weakening economy.',\n",
       " 'UK trade deficit hits four high Ferdinando Giugliano, Economics Correspondent Financial Times February 6, 2015 11:50 am The UK trade deficit hit a four high in 2014, highlighting how companies are struggling to sell their goods abroad despite government efforts to boost exports. The deficit widened to £34.8bn in 2014, the biggest gap since 2010 when it stood at £37.1bn. Both exports and imports fell last , though the former fell more sharply, plunging £16bn. While the UK registered a surplus in its trade in services, the deficit in goods, excluding oil, stood at a record £110bn. The government had hoped that a depreciation of sterling, which has fallen 16 per cent in tradeweighted terms since 2007, would help British companies become more competitive in their overseas markets. But economic stagnation in the eurozone, the UK’s main trading partner, and a tendency by exporters to use the cheaper pound to expand profits instead of market share, help to explain why this has not happened. “We are clearly not making adequate progress in rebalancing our economy,”  David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. “Much greater efforts are needed to develop a national strategy for boosting exports, with improved access to finance for growing firms.” There were signs, however, that falling oil prices helped to narrow the deficit in the last few months of the . While the trade deficit widened in December, growing to £2.9bn from £1.8bn in November, the less volatile quarterly performance was more encouraging. In the last three months of the , imports exceeded exports by £7.1bn, the gap narrowing from £8.7bn in the third quarter as oil imports fell. The volume of overall goods exports rose 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while the volume of imports increased 1.4 per cent. This means that net trade is likely to have made a positive contribution to growth in the three months to December, when the economy expanded 0.5 per cent. Goods export volumes to EU countries, excluding oil and other volatile items. rose 1.5 per cent between the third and fourth quarters, while the same figure for nonEU states stood at 3.2 per cent. Economists are optimistic that the outlook for UK trade in the months ahead will brighten, predicting that the effect of lower oil prices and the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing programme will help boost demand in the eurozone. However, any improvement could be limited by the steep depreciation of the euro against sterling. “The hope for UK exporters has to be that global growth will pick up as 2015 progresses, with eurozone economic activity benefiting from very low oil prices, the much more competitive euro and the ECB’s major monetary stimulus,”  Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “However, the strength of sterling against euro could hamper UK exporters, although the pound has at least retreated markedly against the dollar in recent months,” he added.',\n",

Concern over the ability of the United States to sustain the global economy as most of the world slows will be high on the agenda as the Group of 20 leading economies hold talks in Istanbul on Monday and Tuesday. The meetings come as Greece casts a new shadow over Europe, cheap oil plays havoc with inflation and growth forecasts and a strengthening dollar threatens emerging economies. \"There is a lot at stake,\" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde  in a blog post on Friday. \"Without action, we could see the global economic supertanker continuing to be stuck in the shallow waters of subpar growth and meagre job creation.\" Turkey Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan told an Institute of International Finance (IIF) meeting on Sunday that tackling sluggish global growth and giving low income nations more voice will be among the priorities for Turkey G20 presidency. The former will be easier  than done. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  last week the United States could not be \"the sole engine of growth\" and a senior U.S. official  Washington message going into the meetings would again be that Europe is not doing enough. World financial leaders agreed last  to launch new measures to raise their collective gross domestic product growth over the next five  and create millions of new jobs. The pledge, called the Brisbane Action Plan, entails about 1,000 commitments. European officials  leaders in Istanbul were likely to agree to focus down to just 510 priorities per country to make them easier to monitor. \"Kickstarting global growth will be front and centre\" at the G20 meetings, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver  last week, citing the stalled euro zone, slowdowns in China and India and geopolitical crises in Ukraine, Iraq and Syria as key risks. \"Though America is carrying the world economy at the moment, that is simply not sustainable,\" he added. Germany is likely to argue that its rising domestic demand and plans to increase public spending show Europe largest economy is doing what it can, according to European sources familiar with the G20 agenda. DELICATE BALANCE Babacan  pushing G20 members to meet previous reform commitments would be key, a strategy he has dubbed: \"Keep your word, or explain\". \"It has a lot to do with leadership ...

Higher capital requirements are limiting banks\\' ability to invest and regulators should \"revisit whether they got that calibration right\", the former Bundesbank president told the IIF meeting. \"My key message to policymakers would be very easy don\\'t work against the private sector, work with it,\" he . The G20 put together a global stimulus package during the 200709 financial crisis but today challenge is more delicate, with diverging monetary policies a cause of global turbulence. The U.S. Federal Reserve looks set to raise interest rates this , a stark contrast to impromptu cuts from India to Australia, Canada to Denmark, as well as China cut in bank reserve requirements and the abrupt end to the Swiss franc cap. A senior Canadian official  the G20 communique would probably emphasise the importance of central bank actions in sustaining demand and  the Fed and Bank of England had voiced support for other central banks\\' actions to lift growth. Turkey own monetary policy may also be in the spotlight. Its central bank is under government pressure to cut interest rates ahead of a June election despite stubborn inflation, with critical comments by President Tayyip Erdogan last week sending the lira to a record low. Erdogan renewed his criticism of the central bank on Sunday, saying it would be \"held to account\" if it failed to manage the lira exchange rate against a strengthening dollar. A source close to French Finance Minister Michel Sapin  Greece would be discussed, although the situation was very different to a few  ago, with protection mechanisms in place and European markets less sensitive to its woes.

       " 'Essential Elements to a G20 Growth Plan BY JACOB LEW AND GEORGE OSBORNE 9 Feb 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe Reform, including free trade, should join fiscal and monetary measures on the agenda. Over the past few , our two governments have worked to fuel economic growth, create jobs and improve living standards. Our economies are now growing solidly. However, finance ministers and centralbank governors from the G20 nations gather on Monday in Istanbul against a backdrop of challenges. Global growth is forecast to slow. Deflationary risks are evident in some regions. There is a shortfall in demand. And we face rising geopolitical risks from Ukraine and the Middle East that require coordinated action. Our message at the G20 is this: Governments must use the full set of tools they have at their disposal to support their economies and realize the collective G20 objective of strong, sustainable and balanced global growth. Any comprehensive plan must include three crucial ingredients. First, fiscal policies must maintain a responsible fiscal path while ensuring sufficient resources for education and infrastructure investment for the future. In the U.K. and U.S., fiscal deficits have fallen by half as a share of gross domestic product in the context of stronger economic growth, spending reductions and revenue increases. Precise requirements will differ by country, but all countries need credible plans that can be flexibly implemented. Crucially, plans must be designed to protect the most growth enhancing investments. The burden of reducing deficits must be shared fairly. In the U.K. and the U.S., action was taken to ensure that those with the broadest shoul bear the greatest burden. In addition to prior actions in the U.S., additional measures to bolster the middle class and lower our deficits were contained in President Obama’s budget proposals last week. At an international level, the G20 must continue eliminating incentives for tax avoidance and cracking down on tax evasion, including through coordination and increased transparency. Second, central banks are playing a critical role in supporting accommodative credit conditions that encourage business and household spending and counter deflationary pressures. Forceful monetarypolicy actions in the U.S. and U.K. were essential in helping our economies recover after the global financial crisis. But central banks cannot do the job alone. The third ingredient for a comprehensive economic plan must be the implementation of progrowth structural economic reforms to boost productivity and raise living standards. Domestically that must include better infrastructure, support for small businesses, regulatory reforms that safeguard financial stability and improved education for all. It must also include strong efforts to address impediments that make certain economies structurally less competitive, including the variety of rigidities that constrain growth in several European countries. We share a common interest with our European partners in seeing Greece sustain and build upon its hardfought progress on reforms. In close consultation with its European and international partners, it is  that Greece implement a credible and comprehensive approach to reform, recovery and economic growth. At the European level, there needs to be renewed momentum to complete the single market for services and capital. The entire Continent must do more to support growth and jobs, recognizing that countries have varying degrees of fiscal space. All countries must also honor their G7, G20 and International Monetary Fund exchangerate commitments and obligations. Inders ternationally, we must all strive for further progress on trade agreements that benefit our workers and reflect our values. We are working to conclude a comprehensive EUU.S. trade deal that would significantly expand trade between our nations and support new opportunities for millions of workers in both Europe and the U.S. A comprehensive approach utilizing all three ingredients would help dispel uncertainty and inspire the confidence needed for investment and growth. Finally, the best laid plans can be undone by geopolitical shocks, so we need to contain risks, especially in Ukraine where the situation is of increasing concern. In the end, this crisis needs a political solution. The EU and the U.S. have worked closely together to impose costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and must be prepared to do more if the situation deteriorates, while leaving open a diplomatic offramp if Russia chooses to change course. At the same time, we need to ensure sufficient financial support for Ukraine, including increased support from the U.S., Europe and international institutions as Ukraine undertakes essential economic reforms. In an uncertain world there is once again an urgent need for international coordination to confront problems, contain risks and deliver a comprehensive plan for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Mr. Lew is the U.S. treasury secretary. Mr. Osborne is the U.K. chancellor of the exchequer. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'Uruguay Joins Talks as Participants Engage in 11th TiSA Negotiating Round By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 10, 2015 Feb. 9 — Participants in the plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) accepted Uruguay bid to join the negotiations Feb. 9. Uruguay becomes the 24th World Trade Organization member to participate in TiSA negotiations aimed at liberalizing trade in services industries among willing parties. The trading partners participating in TiSA negotiations are: Australia, Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Costa Rica, the EU, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.S. and Uruguay. The participants, who collectively represent 70 percent of the world $44 trillion services marketplace, convened in Geneva this week for the 11th round of negotiations. Service Sector Negotiations Members will hold formal sessions from Feb. 913 to discuss proposals to liberalize trade in more than a dozen service sectors, including: telecommunications, ecommerce, data localization, financial services, maritime transport, land transport, air transport, professional services, workforce localization, performance requirements, energy services, and environmental services, among others. Members will continue their work from the last TiSA meeting in December by discussing each of sectorial proposals with the exclusion of environmental issues, Geneva trade officials . All but two participants—Paraguay and Pakistan—have introduced offers to specify which areas of their economies they would open to international competition. Though the proposed agreement is based on the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services it would not apply its terms to nonparticipants on a mostfavorednation basis. U.S. ECommerce Proposal When members met in Geneva last December they discussed, among other matters, a U.S. proposal to include new rules regarding ecommerce, data security and privacy (232 WTO, 12/3/14). The U.S. sought specific rules aimed at preventing its trading partners from engaging in forced technology transfer and forced localization practices to support their domestic technology sectors, according to a leaked copy of the proposal. Members have thus far failed to forge an agreement on common rules regarding the treatment of crossborder data flows. U.S. businesses collectively export services more than any other country and would benefit most from streamlined international rules. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative estimates that every $1 billion in U.S. services exports supports more than 5,900 American jobs. Turkish Healthcare Proposal The European Union continued to oppose a draft proposal offered by Turkey to incorporate health services into the agreement. The proposal seeks to establish a structure that permits patients to seek authorized healthcare services in other TiSA countries and receive reimbursement for the cost of such treatments in their home country. European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem recently  the EU would not accept a trade agreement that contained provisions on portability of health insurance. “I do not consider this to be a trade issue and the Commission will not compromise the high level of quality of our public health services in a trade agreement,” Malmstroem  Feb. 5 in a statement.',\n",
       " 'Cairns Group Members Offer Export Competition Proposal Rooted in Rev. 4 Text By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 10, 2015 Feb. 9 — The World Trade Organization should seek to eliminate export subsidies in line with the 2008 revised draft modalities for agriculture,  16 of its members in a recent proposal. The Feb. 6 proposal, which has not yet been made public, urged members to adopt the relevant elements of Rev. 4—namely Section III, paragraphs 160169 and related annexes J, K and L—at the December 2015 Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Modalities are formulas for various outcomes, including reducing tariffs and tradedistorting remedies, last revised in 2008. The proposal was offered by: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam. The 16 members represent a majority of the 20member Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries. Brazil, Bolivia, Indonesia, and the Philippines did not support the proposal. ‘First Building Block.’ WTO members should embrace the proposal as part of their endeavor to advance a work program to address the remaining elements of the 2013 Bali Ministerial Conference by July 31, its sponsors . In Bali ministers promised to “exercise utmost restraint” in using any form of export subsidy and to work for its elimination. “The supporting members do not make this proposal in isolation from the wider agriculture negotiations,” the text of the Cairns proposal . “The supporting members will also be looking for additional meaningful outcomes on market access and domestic support,” it . “A proposal on export competition is merely tabled at this stage as a logical first building block for the membership in constructing a postBali work program.” It is unclear how the group would adjust the original timeframe requirements established by Rev. 4. The text of the 2008 revised draft modalities for agriculture would have required developed countries to eliminate export subsidies by the end of 2013, and developing countries to eliminate their export subsidy entitlements by the end of 2016.',\n",
       " 'Africa to present unified stand on issues at WTO meeting in Kenya JEFF OTIENO The East African, Saturday, 07 February 2015 African countries are working towards a common position on outstanding trade issues ahead of the 10th World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting to be held in Kenya later in the . The initiative, aimed at ensuring African countries get a better deal at WTO negotiations, is being spearheaded by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa and Senegal. At a recent meeting in Cairo, trade ministers from the four countries committed to the development of a work programme by mid that would help consolidate the outstanding issues on the Bali agenda. Trade negotiations at the WTO have moved at a snail’s pace, following disagreements and hardening of positions by member countries on various issues ranging from subsidies, preferential treatment and tariff and nontariff barriers. READ: Trade facilitation in WTO’s Bali Package: What’s in it for Africa? Some of the outstanding issues the ministers are planning to zero in on are those relating to agriculture and development and the cotton trade, viewed as critical to least developed countries. However, the African ministers  all other issues of concern by other countries also need to be part of the discussions in the December meeting, according to a statement from the World Trade Organisation. “Ministers called upon all members to show the necessary political commitment to ensure positive and substantive results, including on issues of interest to Africa. Development, after all, remains the key driving force behind the Doha negotiations,” the statement added. The ministers agreed the Doha Development Agenda remained a critical element in the work of the WTO, adding that multilateral trading system remained an engine for economic growth and development. “Africa is a key beneficiary of a strong and functioning multilateral trading system,” the statement . Agriculturerelated issues still remain critical for African countries in the Doha Development Agenda. The continent has been fighting for more access for its agricultural products to the global market. The countries have also been pushing for the elimination of tradedistorting domestic support, common in the developed world, in addition to the removal of all forms of export subsidies. The issue of subsidies on cotton, for example, has remained a thorny one at the negotiations, with African countries accusing their counterparts in the developed world of trying to kill the critical subsector, which millions of farmers depend on for their livelihood. “The African countries have also been pushing for flexibility to designate a number of products as special products based on certain criteria like food security, livelihood security and rural development,”  agricultural economist George Mwangi. The other matter that is expected to come up in the next WTO negotiations is the lowering of traderelated transaction costs, which is  for landlocked, developing and least developing countries. Mr Mwangi  that facilitating transit traffic along with encouraging crossborder trade can result in marked reduction in the landlocked countries’ import costs. The ministers at the Cairo meeting agreed it was necessary for all WTO members to show flexibility to move the organisation’s work forward. Roberto Azevedo the WTO directorgeneral, who also attended the meeting, welcomed the dialogue. Mr Azevedo, the statement , briefed the ministers on developments in Geneva, including the work to advance all Doha issues as well as implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The director general also informed them of the work in progress concerning the WTO decision on public stockholding and all other Bali decisions. TFA is a protocol whose aim is to boost international trade by doing away with barriers that hinder business among countries. Hong Kong became the first WTO member to ratify TFA and deposited its instrument of acceptance with the secretariat on December 8 last . However, it could take a long time before the TFA enters into force, since the protocol has to be first ratified by twothirds of the WTO’s membership. Already, India has voiced its opposition to the protocol. However, at the Cairo meeting the ministers were optimistic that members will eventually agree on the contentious issues. The ministers resolved also to brief other African countries on the Cairo meeting and encourage engagement among states on the  issues. The African ministers assured the Kenya government that they were determined to make the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference, the first to be held on the African continent, a success by delivering positive outcomes for Africa.',\n",

Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown, Debbie Stabenow and Charles Schumer will be joined by Republicans Jeff Sessions and Lindsey Graham in presenting the measure. The legislation, which is similar to bills introduced in previous , would treat currency undervaluation in a similar way to subsidies provided by foreign governments and allow U.S. companies to seek compensatory duties on imported goods. It will also set out consequences for countries that fail to adopt appropriate policies to eliminate currency misalignment, according to a joint statement from the senators. An identical bill is planned for introduction in the House of Representatives by Democrats Sander Levin and Tim Ryan and Republicans Tim Murphy and Mo Brooks. Many lawmakers are also keen to write rules against currency manipulation into free trade agreements such as the TransPacific Partnership. The 12nation TPP includes Japan, whose currency has depreciated about a third against the U.S. dollar over the last three . But the Obama administration is wary of attaching currency provisions to trade agreements. Negotiators hope to wrap up talks on the TPP within months. (Reporting by Krista Hughes)',\n",

The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are likely to agree on accelerating efforts to achieve \"growth strategies\" they hammered out late last  in Australia. In a communique scheduled to be released Tuesday, the G20 countries are set to confirm they will cooperate on eradicating the funding of terrorism, as terrorists have broadened the scope of their activities. The G20 members are meeting after the International Monetary Fund in January cut its 2015 growth forecast for the world economy to 3.5 percent, down 0.3 percentage point from its previous projection. The eurozone in particular has been struggling to prevent its economy from deteriorating further, in the wake of the antiausterity Syriza party gaining power in Greece. At the G20 gathering, Europe is set to be asked to persuade Greece to stay in the eurozone, as its departure may have a great impact on the global economy and financial markets, sources close to the matter . Since crude oil prices started to slide around June last , many G20 members, including the eurozone, Japan, China, Russia and Australia, have implemented monetary easing steps, as inflation expectations have significantly fallen. Some G20 nations might express wariness of \"competitive currency devaluations,\" which could make financial markets volatile and trigger rapid inflation worldwide, the sources . Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters earlier Monday, \"I am not worried at this point\" that credit easing by central banks such as the BOJ and the European Central Bank will hurt the global economy. From Japan, Finance Minister Taro Aso is attending the G20 meeting along with Kuroda. Aso has suggested Japan will propose the G20 should strengthen its surveillance on illegal financial activities including money laundering. It is the first G20 meeting since the terrorist attacks in France at the offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, as well as the killing of two Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto in the Middle East. The focus is on whether the G20 can map out effective measures to block the financial resources of terrorists.

Meanwhile, the rating firm issued negative outlooks for Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, indicating possible downgrades. It affirmed its ratings on Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Malaysia and Cameroon. The rating changes follow a sharp fall in oil prices in recent months. S&P now assumes an average Brent oil price of $55 a barrel this  and $70 a barrel over the next three , compared with its December projection of $80 a barrel in 2015 and around $85 a barrel through 2018. The downgrades leave Bahrain and Kazakhstan ratings one and two notches, respectively, above junk status, and Venezuela eight notches into junk. Oman stands at Aminus, and Saudi Arabia at doubleAminus. S&P, however, affirmed Abu Dhabi and Quatar doubleA ratings, two notches below the coveted tripleA rating, saying the emirates stronger fiscal positions will be able to buffer the impact of lower oil prices. It also affirmed its A rating on Malaysia and its B rating on Cameroon. S&P noted Bahrain derived about 65% of its fiscal revenue last  from crude oil receipts, which are part of the 84% of total revenue it derives from the oil and gas industry.

       " 'Germany Set Records in Exports, Imports in 2014 10 Feb 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe By Todd Buell in Frankfurt and Bertrand Benoit in Berlin Germany’s exports, imports and trade surplus reached record highs last , spotlighting the unintended effects of the eurozone’s onesizefitsall monetary policy on the region’s mismatched economies. While tepid growth and high unemployment persist in much of the eurozone, the euro’s falling value—a corollary of the European Central Bank’s ultraloose monetary policy— is a boon for the region’s powerhouse, making its exports cheaper outside the currency area. Low oil prices and low inflation at home, meanwhile, are boosting disposable incomes and demand within Germany, as reflected in rising imports. In an ironic twist, news that the ECB’s ultraloose monetary policy is lifting Germany more than the comatose eurozone economies it is designed to stimulate coincides with a mounting backlash among German politicians, business and the media against this policy. German critics of the ECB, who include Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, say that the monetary stimulus may discourage other eurozone governments from undertaking unpopular but sorely needed overhauls of their rigid economies. Others fear that it might fuel speculative bubbles in asset classes ranging from stocks to property in the medium term. Germany’s statistics office, Destatis, reported Monday that 2014 saw records set for exports, imports and the trade surplus. The surplus alone rose to €217 billion ($245.5 billion), shattering the previous record of €195.3 billion set in 2007. And after the ECB’s announcement last month that it would start buying €60 billion a month in assets, including government bonds, in its latest effort to boost inflation in the 19nation bloc, economists expect the euro’s weakness against other major currencies to persist, further supporting the German export machine. “I think that due to the weaker euro we should get stronger exports,” this , ING economist Carsten Brzeski . The weak euro is particularly beneficial to Germany because about twothirds of its exports go outside the currency bloc, he added. The country’s export association  Monday it expects exports to grow by 4% this , beating the 3.7% increase recorded last . “The muchcriticized export surplus will probably increase further, primarily due to the cheap euro,”  Anton Boerner, chairman of the export association BGA, in a statement. Germany’s longstanding trade surplus—the largest in the world from 2002 to 2008—has long drawn criticism from European neighbors, the U.S. and some international organizations for contributing to global economic imbalances. These critics viewed the trade surplus partly as a factor of depressed domestic demand and a sign that Germany wasn’t doing all it could to offer an outlet for struggling eurozone economies. However, German government officials  that such objections hadn’t been raised recently, which they explained by the fact that most critics of the country’s economic policies were also supporters of the ECB’s monetary stimulus as benefiting the eurozone as a whole. The ECB’s role in fueling Germany’s export prowess, they , was being reluctantly accepted as a byproduct of the fact that the central bank is conducting monetary policy for 19 disparate economies. Another factor defusing the criticism is that German domestic demand, long anemic, is also showing signs of vigor. Falling oil prices and inflation rates that have descended into negative territory have translated into higher disposable income for households. Earlier on Monday, Germany’s statistics office reported that inflationadjusted earnings increased by 1.6% last , the highest increase since the index began in 2008. “We think that all wage agreements will be somewhat higher this  than last ,”  Commerzbank economist Ralph Solveen. With an expected inflation rate of just 0.1% this , according to the European Commission, such pay increases will translate almost entirely into higher disposable income. Like exports, imports also set a record in 2014. Goods valued at € 916.5 billion entered Germany, breaking a record set in 2012, the statistics office , citing provisional figures. Retail sales increased by about 1.7% in the fourth quarter from the previous period, and a key consumerconfidence indicator continues to rise. The renewed strength of Germany’s domestic economy could benefit eurozone partners in two ways, analysts say. Germany has more money to spend overall, and a weaker euro means that imports from noneurozone countries are becoming more expensive. “A euro devaluation favors suppliers from other eurozone countries,” says Nils Jannsen, an economist with the IfW institute in the northern German city of Kiel. The European Commission expects GDP to grow 1.5% in Germany in 2015 and 1.3% in the eurozone.',\n",
       " 'Reports Hint at Strategic Win for OPEC 10 Feb 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe OPEC’s strategy of keeping the oil taps open in the face of plunging prices appears to be working, bolstering the group’s grip on markets in importing countries and undercutting the American crude boom,  the cartel and an independent group. The result will be an “inevitable” rebound in oil prices, according to a monthly report by the International Energy Agency. That recovery could start as soon as the second half of the  as U. S. shale production slows, though prices aren’t expected to reach the heights of the past three , when crude traded at more than $ 100 a barrel. “We’re looking at a contraction in the U.S.,”  Antoine Halff, head of the oil industry and markets division of the IEA, a Parisbased group representing the energy interests of industrialized countries. The changes would eventually affect motorists, who have enjoyed some of the lowest gasoline prices in a decade since the cost of crude began a nose dive last June. Booming production from shalerock formations in North America and sluggish global demand have driven prices down by about half, causing spending cuts at oil companies and a sharp decline in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also produced a downbeat forecast for U.S. oil production in its monthly market report, saying it would grow more slowly in 2015— by about 130,000 barrels a day—than expected. The group also reversed an earlier prediction that demand for OPEC oil would decline in 2015, saying instead that it would increase by about 100,000 barrels a day compared with last , to about 29.2 million barrels a day. Oil prices continued an upward trend on Monday. March futures for Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled up 54 cents, or 0.9%, to $58.34 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures exchange. U.S. oil futures settled up $ 1.17, or 2.3%, at $ 52.86 a barrel. The reports highlighted OPEC’s decision in November to forsake its traditional role of propping up prices by cutting production. Led by Saudi Arabia, the group instead decided to keep pumping, a move seen as intended to inflict economic damage on U.S. producers. Oil from newly tapped U.S. shale fields is more expensive to produce than crude in much of the rest of the world, so output is harder to sustain when prices are low.',\n",
       " 'Rich world helping bankroll export of coal technologydata * EU technical experts will debate coal funding this month * OECD meeting on the issue scheduled for March * Industry says coal has a role to play By Barbara Lewis BRUSSELS, Feb 9 (Reuters) Rich nations provided nearly $15 billion over a decade from 2003 to 2013 to fund exports of coalfired power plant and coal mining technology, data seen by Reuters shows, defying calls to end subsidies for the most polluting of the fossil fuels. A document prepared late last  by the Parisbased Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), marked confidential, comes the closest yet to providing official figures on how much the group 34 developed countries provide technology for coal industries outside their own economies. Climate campaigners have been trying for  to collect data as they demand that governments outlaw all fossil fuel subsidies, particularly for coal, which on average emits twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas. The European Union, whose member state France hosts U.N. climate talks this , has  it will end government domestic subsidies for coal plants by 2018. But the future of developed world subsidies for exporting technology to the industry is still a matter of hot debate. The subsidies provided via export credits, or preferential loans, guaranteed by governments will be discussed by European Union technical experts at a closed door meeting in Brussels later this month. The debate will centre on whether and in what form they should continue. A draft document prepared ahead of the meeting, seen by Reuters, notes that the issue is very complex. \"Export credits should contribute to the common goal of addressing climate change,\" that document says, and adds that export finance should be eliminated for \"the least energy efficient and most carbonintensive coal combustion technologies\". Nongovernmental organisations also plan to raise the issue on the sidelines of talks in Istanbul on Monday and Tuesday attended by finance ministers from the G20 leading economies. FRANCE AND GERMANY An OECD spokesperson declined to comment on the confidential figures, which showed France was the EU biggest provider of coal plant export credits over 20032013 with $1.8 billion, followed by Germany, whose multinational conglomerate Siemens makes coal plant technology, at $1 billion. In all of the OECD, the countries that put the most export credits into coal plants were South Korea ($4 billion) and Japan ($3 billion). The United States provided export credits of $1.7 billion. In total the $12.8 billion in coal plant technology export credits offered by the OECD amounted to more than a third of the $36 billion in financing for all kinds of fossil fuel power plants by the group during the decade, the data showed. When it came to coal mining technology, Germany was the largest provider of export credits within the OECD at roughly 60 percent of a global total of $1.8 billion. The largest recipient was Russia, which has been in conflict with the EU since its seizure of Ukraine Crimea region in March last . The coal mining credits accounted for around 3 percent of a global OECD total of $52.6 billion for fossil fuel extraction over the decade. Companies such as France Alstom say that export credits can help to reduce emissions by ensuring cleaner technology is used in nations such as India. However, none of the funding over the decade analysed in the OECD document went to the most efficient of three types of technology the type known as ultra supercritical. Giles Dickson, Alstom vice president for global public affairs,  the company believed export credits would increasingly play \"a decisive role\" in the development of stateoftheart technology in developing countries. \"Our focus going forward with coal is supercritical and ultra supercritical technologies to help ensure that new coal plants maximise their efficiency and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions,\" he . Alstom  it had built ultra supercritical coal generation in Southeast Asia without export credits. The position of the European Power Plant Suppliers Association (EPPSA) is that coal has an  role to play in ensuring stable power supplies and that it is not always possible for smaller plants to be as efficient as larger ones, the industry body  in an email answer to Reuters questions. Climate campaigners dismiss industry arguments as selfserving excuses and want export financing to be stopped altogether. The French energy ministry did not return a request for comment on the OECD figures. Socialist President Francois Hollande announced last November that France would eliminate all export credits to coal projects in developing countries, but it is unclear when the measure will take effect. The German economy ministry also did not respond to Reuters\\' requests for comment. Developed countries should start making data on export credits public, if for no other reason than to set the record straight, the OECD document concluded. \"Given the high profile of climate finance issues, it is hard to argue against having accurate, comprehensive and useful figures on the volume of export credit financing,\" it . If the OECD does not provide the figures, others will and their figures are likely to be \"inflated\", the report . The issue is due to be raised at a general OECD meeting in March.',\n",

Also in the works are the U.S.EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, binding China and 15 other major Asian economies. If they all get done, these agreements would span 49 countries and a huge share of global economic output. Forgotten in all the excitement is the awkward truth that 111 of the World Trade Organization 160 member countries are not part of these megaregionals. Most of the developing world will be shut out. India, Brazil and all of Africa aren\\'t even at the table. The architecture for a new world order in trade is being crafted and rolled out, and these countries will be denied a voice and a foot in the door. And that a shame, says Harsha Singh, a longtime senior WTO official, who was deputy directorgeneral from 2005 to 2013. “The world is getting more interdependent, with trade and investment becoming two sides of the same coin,\" he  in an interview. “If we don\\'t have an inclusive system, whatever system we put in place is going to create tensions and potential conflicts.\" The developing world was the destination for 56 per cent of all foreign direct investment last , pointed out Mr. Singh, now a fellow at both the Genevabased International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development and the Winnipegbased International Institute for Sustainable Development. It also home to a burgeoning middle class, which will grow by a billion people this decade. “A young generation will grow up with the knowledge that they are not part of the system,\" Mr. Singh lamented. “There will be very strong resentment.\" The megaregionals are designed to create business value chains, by giving preferences on tariffs and rulesoforigin to those inside, while denying them to others. The hope of Canada and other countries involved in these megaregionals is that they will become stepping stones to a broader global freetrade deal, reviving the longstalled Doha round of negotiations. Mr. Singh is more pessimistic. Countries, and companies, will quickly adapt their supply chains to take advantage of the lower tariffs, rules and standards within the newly created zones. The standards that exist within these areas will become increasingly difficult for outsiders to meet, creating a barrier rather than a transition to global free trade. “Either you meet the standard, or you start losing market share,\" he explained. These megaregionals would eventually link four main hubs of economic activity – the United States, Europe, Japan and China. Countries will either be in, or out, according to Mr. Singh. Those left outside must work now to forge links with these four powerful hubs, while modernizing their trade regimes to ensure they don\\'t fall behind. The rise of megaregionals was probably inevitable. WTO countries have tried without success since 2001 to reignite global freetrade talks, bogged down on issues such as agricultural subsidies. And so countries looked for other ways to expand free trade. Megaregionals are an answer, but they are not the ultimate solution. Canada has targeted trade expansion into lesserdeveloped countries as part of its 2013 Global Markets Action Plan. The plan identifies 21 emerging markets that offer the “best potential for broad Canadian commercial interests,\" including many of the key economies shut out of the megaregionals, such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and the Philippines. For several  now, most of Canada trade negotiating effort has been directed at agreements with advanced economies. It would be easy to blame developing countries for torpedoing the Doha round and footdragging on economic reforms. But protectionist farm groups in the United States, Japan and Canada are also at fault. A third of the world may well migrate toward a new architecture in trade. But it won\\'t be effective or fair if the other twothirds are outside the fence. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'General Council Chairman Fried to Cede Post to de Mateo Following WTO Meeting By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 11, 2015 Feb. 10 — The chairman of the World Trade Organization General Council, Ambassador Jonathan Fried of Canada, is expected to step down following the Feb. 20 General Council meeting, Geneva trade officials . Mexican Ambassador Fernando de Mateo, the current chairman of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), is viewed as Fried likely successor. The WTO DSB chairmen generally become General Council chairmen after their one terms expire, with some exceptions. Though the annual selection process has not yet been formally announced, the handover is expected to take place in late February or March, Geneva trade officials . Feb. 20 Agenda WTO members will continue to discuss advancing a postBali ministerial work program at this month General Council meeting, according to an agenda published Feb. 10. The WTO trade negotiation groups have been working during the past month to develop a detailed work program to conclude the Doha round of trade negotiations. Members also will discuss the following issues at the Feb. 20 meeting: administration/financial questions, budget, intellectual property, intergovernmental organizations, small and island economies, and trade and development.',\n",
       " 'Rich nations could prefer services from LDCs BD can bank on waiver to book MIC status : Tofail Financial Express 11 Feb, 2015 00:00:00 Waiverproviding countries will try to submit notification to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to offer preferential treatment to least developed countries\\' (LDCs) services by this coming July, the commerce minister  Tuesday. Back from a meeting in Geneva on trade and services, Tofail Ahmed expressed his optimism to reporters that the move if it gets through would greatly facilitate Bangladesh in exporting services from various professions and modes. And this preference to hiring services from members of the poorcountry club would also advance Bangladesh vision to be a middleincome country by its goldenjubilee . A meeting of the Council for Trade and Services (CTS) will be held in March and an assessment report will be prepared by the LDC Group in order to evaluate the commercial value of the preferences on the table and the ensuing need for capacity building in the LDCs concerned, he  at a press briefing at the ministry of commerce (MoC). The commerce minister joined a highlevel meeting on operationalization of the LDC services waiver, on 56 February 2015 at the WTO in Geneva, Switzerland. The press conference was held to inform the press about outcome of the meeting. \"If the developed countries provide waiver facility on services in favour of LDCs, it will help Bangladesh boost its economy towards achieving the middleincome status by 2021,\" Mr Ahmed . The LDC services waiver decision stems from the outcome from a previous WTO ministerial conference held in Geneva in 2011. However, in the two  that followed, no preferences had been requested by LDCs or granted to them, prompting WTO members to reconsider ways to move this decision forward, the commerce minister mentioned. He  at the highlevel meeting on services many countries indicated their preferences for LDCs in the service sector. The LDCs should work together to reap benefit from the membercountries. The minister  most of the developed countries, including European Union (EU) states, Mexico, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, China, Korea, Jamaica and Qatar, indicated their willingness to provide preferential treatment to the LDCs for ensuring effective implementation of services waiver. But the United States of America (USA) refrained from making any commitment. Under this move, Bangladesh sectors like Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) and Business Operations Processing services, Auditing, Accounting, Financial services, hotel, tourism, independent professionals, computerrelated services may have preferential access to the waiverproviding countries. The minister also  for the extension of the Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver in pharmaceuticals, which will expire on 31 December 2015, the LDCs will work together. He  during his Geneva visit, he had sat in a bilateral meeting with DirectorGeneral of the WTO Roberto Azevedo. They exchanged views on the outcome of the highlevel meeting on services and progress in developing work programme for Doha Development Agenda. Two separate meetings were held with secretarygeneral of UNCTAD Mukhisa Kituyi and trade, industry and cooperatives minister of Uganda Amelia Anne Kyambadde.',\n",
       " 'Lawmakers press currency as trade debate heats up By Doug Palmer 2/10/15 5:17 PM EST POLITICO A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday threatened to withhold support for President Barack Obama’s trade agenda unless their concerns about foreign currency manipulation are addressed, but it remained unclear whether they could rally enough votes to block key trade legislation or an AsiaPacific trade deal. “The bottom line is the administration could make their job of passing something a lot easier if they listened to us,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (DN.Y.)  at a news conference with other senators to introduce legislation aimed primarily at China that would allow U.S. manufacturers to win countervailing duties on goods from countries that deliberately undervalue their currency for a trade advantage. The White House opposes the bill, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers also introduced today in the House, and has balked at including rules against currency manipulation in the proposed TransPacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other countries in the fastgrowing AsiaPacific. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and other U.S. officials say they worry either approach could backfire on the United States by undermining international efforts to prod China toward a marketoriented exchange rate and to discourage Japan from resuming its past practice of intervening in currency markets to devalue the yen. They got support on that point from the U.S.China Business Council, which represents companies that do business in China. “Over the past ten , we have seen how continued engagement from two administrations, Democrat and Republican, has led to China’s currency appreciating more than 35 percent against the U.S. dollar,” the group’s president, John Frisbie,  in a statement. “The Bush and Obama administration’s successful multilateral and bilateral approach should be supported and continued, not undermined with counterproductive tariff legislation that taxes the American consumer.” The White House also does not want Federal Reserve monetary policy that could have the effect of devaluing the dollar to be subject to enforceable provisions of a trade deal. But supporters of including currency rules in trade agreements argue that’s an unfounded concern because their only intent is to go after countries that directly intervene in currency markets for a trade advantage. “I believe there is growing support on the Republican side, on the Democratic side to ensure that TPP, TPA [Trade Promotion Authority] doesn’t pass until we deal with this issue,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, . “This [bill] is a bipartisan solution to a bipartisan problem.” The 10 initial Senate cosponsors also include Jeff Sessions (RAla.), Sherrod Brown (DOhio) and Debbie Stabenow (DMich.), who raised similar concerns at the press conference, as well as Richard Burr (RN.C.), Susan Collins (RMaine), Bob Casey (DPenn.) Joe Donnelly (DInd.) and Rob Portman (ROhio), who did not attend. Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on House Ways and Means, argued at a separate news conference earlier in the day for a twotrack approach that includes persuading TPP countries to agree to enforceable rules against currency manipulation and passing the countervailing duty legislation. Reps. Tim Murphy (RPenn.), Tim Ryan (DOhio) and Mo Brooks (RAla.) joined Levin as cosponsors of the House currency bill, which was immediately backed by labor and auto groups as well as a respected international economist, Fred Bergsten, president emeritus of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Washingtonbased think tank estimates that 10 to 20 countries, including China, manipulate their currency for an unfair trade advantage. “That has had a very substantial affect on the United States, probably adding to our trade deficit by several hundred billion dollars per , costing us several million jobs,” Bergsten . “Currency manipulation is the number one protectionist policy of the 21st century and something you just have to deal with,” Bergsten added. “It is very clearly a major export subsidy to a company selling to the United States from China or anywhere else when the country’s currency is substantially undervalued through manipulation,” he . Both Levin and Bergsten agreed that Japan was not currently manipulating its currency, even though Bank of Japan monetary policies aimed at stimulating the country’s economy have caused the yen to decline against the dollar. But Levin and many other Midwestern lawmakers argue it is  to include enforceable rules against currency manipulation in TPP because Japan has directly intervened in the foreign exchange market in the past to boost its exports. Despite strong feelings in Congress on the issue, the Obama administration appears to be making the calculation that it can win approval of both TPA and TPP without giving in to demands on the currency front. More than 230 House members and 60 senators signed letters in 2013 calling on the administration to address currency concerns in the TPP pact. After the November election those tallies have shrunk to 198 House members and 52 senators, including two senators who were elected to the upper chamber from the House last . While those are still large numbers, it is possible that some members who signed the letters could still vote for TPP without currency provisions if other elements of the deal, such as new market access for U.S. exports, are attractive enough. Meanwhile, past efforts to pass currency legislation have all come to a dead end. Both the House and the Senate approved currency bills in 2010 and 2011 that were similar to the ones introduced today, but neither became law. A number of  Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, opposed those previous efforts to treat currency manipulation as an export subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law. Asked for comment today, both Hatch and Ryan stressed their concern about currency manipulation but showed little enthusiasm for the bill. “The chairman shares concerns about currency manipulation, but questions whether this would be an effective strategy to combat it and, additionally, is concerned about its WTO [World Trade Organization] compliance,” a spokesman for Ryan , even though supporters say the measure has been carefully crafted to comply with global trade rules. Hatch added: “I think it’s going to be really tough to get it unless there is presidential leadership, and from a foreign policy standpoint there are a lot of problems.” Schumer and his cosponsors  it did not matter to them whether the currency bill passed as part of TPA or as a standalone measure. But without action on the issue, the administration will have a much harder task of winning its trade agenda, they warned. Adam Behsudi contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Currency Warriors Get Boost At G20 By Ian Talley and Brian Blackstone 11 February 2015 The Wall Street Journal ISTANBUL The world top finance leaders on Tuesday in effect backed currency depreciation as a tool for promoting growth by signaling strong support for aggressive easymoney policies aimed at boosting the fragile global economy. The support by finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 largest economies for mass monetary easing policies that have weakened exchange rates from Europe to Japan is at odds with the traditional view that currency depreciation could have damaging effects on other economies. It also reflects worry that economies in much of the world could get stuck in a lowgrowth rut without decisive cash injections from central banks. It marks an implicit acknowledgment of the failure across the globe to enact longerlasting structural overhauls to major economies after  of relying on shortterm spending and other temporary stimulus programs. The finance ministers appeared to be \"trying to reduce tensions over perceived competitive devaluations by saying it in the collective good,\"  Simon Johnson, professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. International support for \"accommodative monetary policies,\" as the G20 statement issued at a meeting here put it, came the same day China  consumer prices last month rose just 0.8% compared with a  earlier, the slowest growth in five . The announcement sparked fears that China might be tilting toward deflation, and boosted pressure on China central bank to cut interest rates and expand credit. With its economy slowing and many industries dealing with overcapacity from the boom , China is contributing to the world pricing problems through its huge exports of manufactured goods. \"The price of goods shipped out of China is getting weaker, trickling down and affecting global inflation,\"  Societe Generale CIB economist Wei Yao. The link between central bank policies and exchange rates has been particularly pronounced in Europe. The European Central Bank announcement last month that it would purchase more than 1 trillion euros in public and private bonds by autumn 2016 prompted a steep drop in the euro value against the U.S. dollar, both in anticipation of last month decision and in its aftermath. The dollar rise to decadelong highs has revived concerns in Congress about perceived currency manipulation by other countries and its impact on U.S. exports and competitiveness. On Tuesday, lawmakers introduced a bill that would allow the U.S. government to impose punitive duties on imports from countries whose finances fit a pattern of manipulation. But U.S. administration officials, for now, appear to have concluded that any growthdragging effects from a stronger dollar would be offset by faster overseas growth. \"It not going to be a good ride for the global economy if the one strong wheel is the United States,\"  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who attended the G20 meetings along with Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. Seven  after the global financial crisis pushed the world economy into a nose dive, the G20 is still struggling to find the right recipe to revive growth. Windfalls from plummeting oil prices and a revvingup of growth in the U.S., the world largest economy, aren\\'t proving enough to pull Europe and Japan out of their economic funks. Meanwhile, major emerging markets, including China, are slowing much faster than expected as they hit the limits of their capacity to grow without extensive economic restructuring. This has put added pressure on central banks to ramp up stimulus through rate cuts or printing vast amounts of new money to spur borrowing and spending. A side effect has been lower exchange rates, particularly for the euro and yen, and upward pressure on currencies in traditional havens, such as Switzerland, as well as in countries like the U.S. that are expected to tighten monetary policy this . \"The use of that monetary policy, if it done on a large scale, will depreciate your currency, there no question about it,\"  one senior G20 official. \"That depreciation . . . is seen as acceptable by international standards to get output going.\" To be sure, the G20 statement didn\\'t support overt policies aiming to weaken exchange rates such as interventions in currency markets to gain a competitive edge. Rather, G20 officials stressed that monetary policy decisions should be made for domestic economic objectives. \"There is a clear agreement of all countries on the fact that monetary policies are done for domestic reasons to achieve inflation objectives,\"  Christian Noyer, head of France central bank. However, differences in monetary policy settings across central banks can affect exchange rates, he noted. The rationale for fresh monetary policy stimulus taken so far this  in many parts of the world from China to Australia and eurozone was underscored by a series of reports Tuesday showing consumer prices flattening or declining in many key economies. Beneath their sluggish pace in China, consumer prices in Switzerland fell 0.5% in January from a  earlier, and 0.3% in Denmark. Central banks in these countries have loosened monetary policy this . Low inflation can be a windfall for households, but if prices stay soft for too long they may harm the economy by raising debtservicing costs and making it less attractive for businesses to invest. For this reason, many large central banks consider around 2% to be the optimal rate of inflation. Yet the backing of aggressive centralbank stimulus has a more troubling side: Governments appear to lack the resources, or the will, to lift their economies\\' prospects through fiscal policies and economic reforms, putting all the more pressure on central bankers. Most advanced economies racked up high debt levels in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, making it harder to cut taxes or raise spending. In Germany, one country that has such fiscal maneuvering room, officials have resisted calls to use it. \"In Europe, there a need for more fiscal policy. There a demand shortfall,\"  Mr. Lew. Meanwhile, a report Monday from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development warned that many of its members have failed to take recommended steps to overhaul their economies in recent .',\n",
       " 'U.S. business lobby survey warns of China protectionism BEIJING (Reuters) China regulators are targeting foreign firms, a majority of respondents  in a survey by an American business lobby, citing protectionism among the top concerns for their operations in the world second largest economy. Fiftyseven percent of the 477 respondents included in an annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China  they believed recent government investigations \"singled out\" foreign companies. The survey results, published on Wednesday, also  increasing protectionism had become the fifth greatest concern for businesses in China for the first time since 2010. Labor costs, unclear laws and regulations, and shortages of qualified staff and managers, remained atop the list of business challenges. \"There are concerns that China will take an approach, that when the economy slows down, they become more protectionist,\" Chamber chairman James Zimmerman told reporters. On Monday, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc agreed to pay a $975 million fine, the largest in China corporate history, ending a 14month government investigation into anticompetitive practices. In recent months, four international business lobbies have raised alarms over how China antitrust regulators carried out investigations. At least 30 overseas firms, including U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp and South Korea Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, have come under scrutiny. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which conducted the Qualcomm investigation, has defended its practices and  it does not target foreign companies. Cyber security, the risk of intellectual property leakage and data security threats were greater in China than in other markets, according to 60 percent of survey respondents. Business lobbies have also warned that foreign technology vendors could be locked out of China business or forced to disclose sensitive intellectual property as the country implements new cyber security regulations. Despite the concerns cited in the survey, the majority of Chamber members were positive about the China market over the next two , with 73 percent saying their businesses were profitable or very profitable.

After almost a  of fighting, the two countries signed an agreement that put an end to the free trade in sugar enjoyed by the two countries since 2008 under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The deal, reached through a \"suspension agreement,\" halted antidumping probes which had included subsidies and tariffs against the Mexican sweetener. It also eliminated Mexico threat to take the dispute to international trade bodies. \"It is obviously not an ideal, which would have allowed us to export as much as we wanted, but it was what was possible,\"  Guajardo, whose office handles trade negotiations with the United States. He  Mexico sugar industry, which exports its surplus to U.S. markets, benefits from high American prices derived from the United States\\' very protective sugar program. \"It obviously wasn\\'t in the interest of Mexican sugar producers to weaken the sugar program, which would be like shooting yourself in the foot,\" Guajardo . \"A deal that is not optimal is still better than a harmful dispute,\" he . The deal reached in December allows Mexico to supply 100 percent of the excess U.S. sugar demand, after U.S. producers and other countries with fixed ceilings have filled their quotas. As part of its agreements with the United States, Mexico last week issued rules to control its sugar exports the world over, allowing it to track the actual amount of sugar that reaches the United States and not exceed its ceiling.

       " \"India Will Not ‘Appease' U.S. Over Intellectual Property Regime By Amrit Dhillon WTO Reporter, February 11, 2015 Feb. 10 — India Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has rejected speculation that the India government is willing to “appease” the U.S. over its intellectual property regime. In a Feb. 9 tweet, Sitharaman responded to a question asking why India was trying to “appease” the U.S. by saying: “Our IPR policy is in the making. The draft is out inviting inputs from all. No ‘trying to appease’ anyone.” India is currently working on a new IP policy. A special panel set up to examine the issues and make recommendations has given a report to the government, and the public has been invited to comment. The draft report does not recommend any dilution of India policy on patents or compulsory licensing (04 WTO, 1/7/15). Speculation about India intentions in the India media arose from the testimony of U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee Jan. 27 . “Use of the outofcycle review helped to secure commitments from India in the 2014 Trade Policy Forum on a broad range of IP issues of concern to the United States and its stakeholders,” Froman . “I believe we have a good dialogue going with the new government on this issue and we are committed to working to achieve concrete progress in this area.” Froman remark prompted media speculation that India had agreed to dilute its policy to meet American accusations that India IP policy is discriminatory. The USTR has strongly criticized India IPR in the past. In April 2014, in its “Special 301” report reviewing the intellectual property protections of its trading partners, the USTR downgraded India status to “priority foreign country”—meaning it would be subject to intense scrutiny over its IP policies—a status which it later withdrew. The belief that India is making concessions also has arisen from the October 2014 agreement between the U.S. and India, as part of the Trade Policy Forum, to set up an Intellectual Property Working Group (190 WTO, 10/1/14). In addition, during President Barack Obama visit to India last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a meeting with India and American CEOs, : “India is ready to accept suggestions made by the joint working group with the U.S. on intellectual property rights.” Khrishna Sharma, managing partner at the Corporate Law Group in New Delhi, which represents the foreign pharmaceutical industry, told Bloomberg BNA Feb. 10 that no one knew the deliberations of the working group but that India stand on IPR at every international forum so far has remained unchanged. “Even if this government wanted to change the IPR policy, it would have to be enacted by amendments to India law, and at present the ruling party has a majority in the lower house but not in the upper house. Moreover, it not clear how the government would sell the change politically,” she . Punita Bhargava, an advocate with Inventure IP and a member of the panel advising the government on a new IP policy, told Bloomberg BNA Feb. 10 that the panel had received no directive from the government to suggest that the media speculation was correct. “We have heard nothing of this kind from the government,” she . “On Feb. 56, we met 50 stakeholders, including officials from the U.S. government, [multinational corporations] and the UK Patent Office. We are collating all the feedback and hope to give the final report at the end of March,” she . Bangalorebased IP expert Shamnad Basheer, former professor at the National University of Judicial Sciences,  media speculation seemed to be fuelled by two factors: the U.S. sounding happier than before and the lack of information about the deliberations of the bilateral working group on IPR. “Absolutely nothing has changed in India policy,” Basheer . “The problem is that no one knows what is going on in the bilateral dialogue and that is creating anxiety. And the fact that the U.S. seems less critical is also feeding concerns that India might make concessions damaging to the IPR,” he . But, he added, “on a day when the ruling party has suffered a gigantic defeat in the New Delhi elections at the hands of a propoor, prosocialistic party, it is not likely to make any policy change that could be seen to be detrimental to the interests of the poor.”\",\n",
       " 'India sugar mills make distress sales to pay farmers By Rajendra Jadhav MUMBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) India cashstrapped sugar mills, waiting on the government to approve export subsidies, are being forced to dump supplies in the domestic market to raise cash to pay cane farmers, pulling down local prices to 41/2  lows. The aggressive selling comes as production exceeds demand for a fifth straight  and is set to deepen losses for producers like Bajaj Hindusthan, Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd and Balrampur Chini Mills. Without any government incentive, India sugar is uncompetitive in world markets well supplied by lowcost producers Brazil and Thailand. India, the world secondbiggest sugar producer, exported more than 1 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2014 but has shipped out little in the current season that began on Oct. 1. \"Mills don\\'t have a choice,\"  Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association (BSMA). \"On the one hand the sugar commissioner is asking them to pay farmers cane dues quickly, on the other hand demand is weak for sugar.\" Each  the federal government and states fix the price at which mills can buy cane from farmers. The cane price has climbed 65 percent in five , while sugar prices have fallen 8 percent. Some cooperative mills from the western state of Maharashtra, the biggest producer, sold sugar at 2,460 rupees ($40) per 100 kg this week, the lowest level since August 2010. \"Cost of production is higher than current sugar prices. Mills are not able to pay the stipulated cane price,\"  Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. \"Exports can help reduce the stockpile and raise prices, but the government is delaying a subsidy announcement.\" Subsidies of 3,300 rupees a tonne helped exports of raw sugar last  and government sources  last month India was considering a rise in the subsidy to 4,000 rupees this . But Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet has yet to approve the proposal, potentially halving this  raw exports from a  ago. \"To make cane payments mills are ready to sell sugar at whatever price they are getting,\"  Balasaheb Patil, chairman of Sahyadri cooperative sugar factory based in Maharashtra. India is likely to produce 26 million tonnes of sugar in the current season, up to 4 percent above an earlier estimate. Local demand is pegged around 24.7 million tonnes. \"Inventory is rising every day due to ongoing cane crushing. Prices are unlikely to recover unless we manage to sell in the world market,\" BSMA Jain . ($1 = 62.0850 India rupees) (Editing by Richard Pullin)',\n",
       " 'U.S. airlines disclose details of bookings lost to Gulf carriers By Jeffrey Dastin Feb 10 (Reuters) U.S. airlines have lost at least five percentage points of their share of flight bookings from the United States to the India subcontinent and Southeast Asia since 2008, due to fierce competition from Gulf carriers, according to data seen by Reuters. More recently, U.S. carriers have seen an erosion in their share of bookings to Milan, according to a report the U.S. airlines sent to the White House and the departments of State, Transportation and Commerce. The 55page white paper is not yet public. The report says the combined share of bookings between the United States and the India subcontinent for Delta Air Lines , United Airlines and American Airlines has fallen to 34 percent in 2014 from 39 percent in 2008. The drop includes bookings on the airlines\\' jointventure partners, such as British Airways and Air France. In the same time, Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have surpassed them. The Gulf airlines\\' share of that market has jumped to 40 percent from only 12 percent seven  ago, according to the report. The report sheds light on the intensifying battle between the U.S. carriers and their rivals from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates since \"Open Skies\" agreements authorized commercial flights between those countries and the United States more than a decade ago. The data shows that the Gulf carriers have eroded U.S. airlines\\' market share even beyond the subcontinent, although bookings to the region resulted in the largest revenue hit so far, Delta Chief Legal Officer Ben Hirst  in a telephone interview. U.S. airlines and their jointventure partners\\' share has fallen to 36 percent from 43 percent of the market between the eastern United States and Southeast Asia, according to the report. The region includes Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Gulf carriers, meanwhile, expanded their share of bookings to 13 percent from just 1 percent. GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES The U.S. airlines are stepping up efforts to persuade the American government to alter or terminate the Open Skies pacts. The white paper, citing confidential financial statements from the Gulf airlines, alleged that their rivals have received subsidies from their home governments contrary to U.S. trade policy. The report says loans, tax exemptions and other support totaled more than $40 billion since 2004, which the Gulf carriers used to pay expenses that airlines typically must cover themselves, such as aircraft acquisitions. \"We fully expect the government to act on the evidence,\" Delta Hirst , adding, \"From the U.S. airlines\\' standpoint, we\\'re competing with (foreign) governments, not private businesses.\" An official from the U.S. State Department  the agency was carefully reviewing the claims and coordinating with other agencies. \"The U.S. government takes seriously the competition concerns raised by our airlines,\" the official  in an email on condition of anonymity. \"However, we remain committed to the Open Skies policy, which has greatly benefited the traveling public, the U.S. aviation industry, American cities, and the broader U.S. economy.\" CHEAPER FARES The report says the Gulf carriers could drive ticket prices down to a point where U.S. airlines could not afford to stay in certain markets, costing hundreds of jobs. They say government subsidies enable the Gulf carriers to buy planes and add capacity in excess of demand, forcing industrywide price cuts on certain routes. But advocates for travelers say that slashing prices and improving service is precisely what Open Skies agreements are intended to do. \"From the passengers\\' point of view, they want as many choices as possible,\"  Erik Hansen, a senior director at the U.S. Travel Association, a nonprofit industry group based in Washington. Hansen  he had not seen the report and could not comment in detail on its findings, but added that Open Skies pacts have improved the U.S. balance of trade. He  a change would \"send a message that the U.S. is willing to implement protectionist policies if just a few airlines protest.\" Executives of the Gulf carriers dispute the U.S. carriers\\' charges that they have received unfair subsidies and bailouts. \"We have no problem with competition. In fact, we relish it,\" Emirates Airline President Tim Clark  in a statement last week. The Gulf airlines are pushing to expand their reach. U.S. carriers have lost their share of bookings from New York to Milan since Emirates announced service there in 2013 as a stopover on the way to Dubai.

       " 'Japan and Mongolia sign free trade pact, lowering barriers for auto exports Associated Press February 10, 2015 6:05 AM TOKYO — Japan and Mongolia signed a free trade agreement Tuesday that is expected to open the landlocked frontier market to more Japanese auto exports and strengthen Tokyo leverage with a key partner in its dealings with North Korea. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Mongolian counterpart Chimed Saikhanbileg signed the agreement at a summit in Tokyo. As part of the \"economic partnership agreement,\" Mongolia assured resourcescarce Japan of stable access to supplies of coal and rare earths. Japan has looked to Mongolia, India and other countries to help reduce its reliance on China for rare earths — minerals used in hightech products and automobiles. Japan reportedly also was due to offer concessional loans for building a new airport in Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital, one of Tokyo many official development assistance projects in the country. The two countries began free trade talks in 2012 and reached a basic accord last July. Mongolia imports from Japan, mostly vehicles, are roughly 16 times the size of its exports to Japan. The agreement signed Tuesday calls for Japan to scale back tariffs on its imports of Mongolian products such as cashmere. Mongolia holds strategic importance for Japan as a conduit for Japan talks with North Korea on abductions of Japanese decades ago. Japan lacks formal relations with North Korea and the two sides have held talks on the kidnapping issue in Mongolia. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'U.S. Launches New Trade Challenge Against China 11 February 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News WASHINGTONThe U.S. opened a new front in the longrunning trade conflict with China, challenging a broad program Beijing uses to subsidize export businesses. The new challenge at the World Trade Organization is part of the Obama administration efforts to step up enforcement of existing trade rules as it seeks to win support a new trade agreement that would include Pacific countries. President Barack Obama last month warned that the new bloc under negotiation, which includes Japan but not China, is  to prevent Beijing from writing the rules of trade in the Pacific area. Despite the trade challenges, the White House has emphasized that relations with China are complex, and on Tuesday Mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a range of issues, including climate change and nuclear talks with Iran. The latest WTO case is similar to a previous challenge of China subsidies for autos and auto parts. This time, the subsidies come through a system called \"demonstration bases,\" U.S. officials . California agricultural trade with China, valued at $1.4 billion, is one of the industries affected by subsidies of Beijing fruit, vegetable and poultry production,  Rep. Jim Costa in a statement. \"China appears to be giving prohibited export subsidies to companies spanning a diverse group of industries, including textiles, apparel and footwear, advanced materials and metals,\" Mike Froman, the U.S. trade representative,  Wednesday. \"All of these services, provided free or at a discount, undermine fair competition.\" The Chinese embassy in Washington didn\\'t immediately respond to a request to comment. The demonstration bases are government programs through which local officials offer subsidies to small exporters, according to Chinese government documents. The programs focus on industries including auto parts, technology and agriculture. China Ministry of Commerce began fostering the vehicles in 2010 as a way to bolster the country small exporters, the documents . One Beijing city government document  China has 179 such programs that have been recognized by the commerce ministry. The amount of support varies, depending on where the programs are based and the industries they focus on, according to the documents. In China eastern Anhui province, for example, the local demonstration base offers subsidies of up to 10% of the cost of an applicant project, according to a document on the commerce ministry website. The amount of the subsidy is capped at 1 million yuan (about $160,000,) it . Beneficiaries included companies that export items including processed meat, fish, tea and honey. Local officials evaluated the companies based on their potential as exporters, certification in their target markets and other criteria. In eastern Jiangsu province, a demonstration base there was seeking applicants among agricultural companies for a 1 million yuan to 2 million yuan subsidy, according to documents. Recipients included two local seedexporting companies that received a total of 2.4 million yuan between 2011 and 2013. The current case is unlikely to gain as much attention as previous highprofile disputes involving specific Chinese industries, but trade experts say the case is representative of the web of difficulties that U.S. companies blame for complicating their operations there. \"This administration has been filing cases for , particularly against China, in order to demonstrate its enforcement credentials,\"  Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents businesses. \"It a targetrich environment, the main constraints being likelihood of victory and ability to assemble hard evidence from a government that is often less than transparent.\"',\n",
       " 'Q&A: US challenges China export subsidies Aaron Stanley in Washington 12 February 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) The latest trade spat between the US and China is over what Washington says are illegal Chinese export subsidies for agriculture, medical goods and other sectors. On Wednesday, the US  it had called for formal talks at the World Trade Organisation over China use of \"demonstration bases\" the first step towards bringing a possible WTO case. What are \"demonstration bases\" and why is the US challenging them? Demonstration bases are clusters of industry in China that, upon meeting certain performance targets, receive discounted goods and services from the government to facilitate exports. US investigators identified 179 such bases across seven different sectors and probably others as allegedly receiving the subsidies. The US asserts that these bases, which received $1bn in government assistance from 20102012, are selling their products on the international market to the detriment of US industry. Just 16 out of 40 identified bases that produce textiles combined to export $33.3bn of goods in 2012 alone. That same , six bases that produce seafood exported $3.6bn 20 per cent of China total seafood exports. How did the US discover this programme? The US uncovered the network of subsidies during a previous case raised at the WTO regarding unfair auto parts subsidies. The dispute was resolved in the consultations stage, as China removed the programme in question. But in its investigation, the US unearthed what a USTR official claims was a broad \"systemic programme of illegal export subsidies\" supporting numerous other sectors. Chinese government opacity made the probe inherently difficult, but after some detective work and poring over more than 5,000 pages of Mandarintranslated documents, US investigators were able to piece together the details. What are the political effects in the US? As negotiations for the TransPacific Partnership deal near the home stretch, a serious question mark remains over whether President Obama will be able to round up the votes in Congress. Showing aggression in enforcing existing trade rules and promulgating the argument that trade benefits America as long as all actors play by the rules is a key strategy to winning the votes needed to pass Trade Promotion Authority, which would give Mr Obama the negotiating leverage he needs. US politicians from both parties have often painted China as a bogeyman to defend domestic industries in key political areas such as the rust belt states of Ohio and Michigan. In 2012, Mr Obama campaigned on a \"tough on China\" platform, and his administration has raised and won WTO disputes against China on raw materials, rare earth mineral exports, wind power and improperly imposed antidumping duties. Because this case covers a wide swath of industries including advanced materials, medical products, chemicals and agriculture it has the potential to win over members of Congress who represent hubs for several sectors. The action also seeks to rally liberal Democrats who oppose Mr Obama trade agenda as being harmful to American workers. Representative David Price, a North Carolina Democrat who has previously held a neutral posture toward the TPP,  on Wednesday he was inclined to support the deal, believing that its high standards can be enforced. What happens next? Under WTO rules, if the dispute is not resolved during a 60 day consultation period, the US can request the establishment of a dispute settlement panel on the grounds that China actions are inconsistent with its accession protocol to the WTO and the WTO subsidies agreement. These accords deem certain types of export subsidies to be distorting and illegal. The panel must issue its recommendation no later than nine months after it is established. The parties must then opt either to accept the decision or seek an appeal. If a country is found to be in violation of WTO rules, it is given a window of time to modify the illegal programme or face potential retaliation.',\n",
       " 'China Stands Firm on Latest GPA Offer Amid Calls for Broader Inclusion of SOEs By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 12, 2015 Feb. 11 China will not consider the inclusion of any new stateowned enterprises (SOEs) following its latest bid to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), according to discussions held Feb. 11 in Geneva. In December, China offered several improvements in its fifth revised GPA offer, including lowered procurement thresholds and increased entity coverage that includes at least one SOE, the China Post Group (3 WTO, 1/6/15). GPA members like the U.S. and the European Union urged China to expand its list of GPAcompliant stateowned enterprises during a Feb. 11 meeting of the Government Procurement Committee. China refused to expand the scope of coverage and  members should adopt a practical attitude to its latest offer. The WTO Government Procurement Committee concluded without a resolution to the disagreement and will next meet during the first week of June. Ireland deputy permanent representative John Newham will take over as committee chairman in March following the departure of current chairman, Krzysztof Trepczynski of Poland, who is returning to Warsaw. Billions at Stake GPA members are interested in opening up China $88 billion annual state procurement marketplace to foreign bidders and have sought concessions in each of China six GPA proposals over the past seven . China agreed in 2001 to accede to the GPA, which sets out rules guaranteeing fair conditions of international competition for government procurement contracts. The goal of the GPA is to open up government procurement deals to international trade and competition, while ensuring transparency and a commitment to good governance. The GPA is a plurilateral agreement under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization, meaning that the market access concessions are only granted to suppliers in those countries that have acceded to the agreement. There are 43 parties to the GPA, including: Armenia; Canada; the EU, with its 28 member states; Hong Kong; Iceland; Israel; Japan; Korea; Liechtenstein; the Netherlands with respect to Aruba; Norway; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan and the U.S. More to be Done Delegations from Korea, Japan, Norway, Singapore and the U.S. collectively  China latest offer was an improvement but fell short because of inadequate inclusion of SOEs, among other concerns. The EU   gaps remain in China latest offer, including the country persistent refusal to cover procurement by SOEs, its demand for domestic content requirements and a three transition period to phase in the final thresholds. Without substantial improvements to the offer, a broad swath of the Chinese government procurement marketplace would not be covered in the GPA, the Canadian delegation . China  it was willing to continue the negotiations with respect to domestic content requirements but did not say if it would make a further revised offer. Committee chairman Trepczynski asked China to reconsider its position on the scope of coverage and urged members to proceed in a constructive manner. Ukraine, Moldova Bids Advance GPA members commended the latest bids submitted by Ukraine and Moldova and  they are on track to accede to the agreement as soon as this summer. Ukraine, which submitted its first offer in March 2014,  it would address any remaining concerns about its accession in a yettobe circulated third draft offer. The EU, U.S., Canada, Japan and Taiwan hailed Moldova fourth offer, which was submitted last month and cited few remaining clarifications standing in the way of its accession. Separately, GPA members accepted Pakistan request to join the negotiations as an observer and hailed Pakistan commitment to negotiate its accession to the agreement. Pakistan  it would consider procurement legislation in line with the model devised by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and  it was determined to undergo necessary reforms to join the agreement. Buy America Concerns Canada again urged the U.S. to curb domestic legislation that requires the purchase of American products in federal, state and municipal procurement deals. Canada cited two specific U.S. initiatives of concern: ?U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx Jan. 28 statement that the administration would seek to strengthen Buy America forced localization requirements for programs funded by the Department of Transportation, and ?the Obama administration Feb. 2 budget proposal for fiscal  20152016, which indicated its intent to resubmit the GROW America Act to Congress. Canada asked the U.S. to explain how such policies were consistent with Article XXII:6 of the revised GPA, which states that each party shall seek to avoid introducing or continuing discriminatory measures that distort open procurement. The EU, Japan, Israel, Hong Kong, China, Switzerland and Singapore echoed Canada concerns. The U.S.  it takes its international obligations seriously, including its obligations under Article XXII:6, and ensures all covered procurement complies with its commitments. The U.S. delegation further questioned whether such issues would be better addressed in pending free trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or the TransPacific Partnership.',\n",

The U.S. would welcome any updates Brunei can provide on the progress it is making toward economic diversification, and how Brunei expects low oil prices to impact its longterm economic growth and government financing,  Chris Wilson, the deputy chief of the U.S. Mission to the WTO. Brunei dependence on oil and gaswhich represented 96 percent of its total merchandise exports in 2013remains a cause for concern due to fluctuating international energy prices,  a summary of the WTO trade policy review. The reduction in oil and gas export revenues in 2013 led Brunei trade balance surplus to decrease from $7.8 billion in 2008 to $6.9 billion in 2013, the WTO found. The WTO Trade Policy Review Body will complete its review of Brunei Darussalam trading status on Feb. 12. TPP Participant Despite concerns about Brunei diversification programs, the U.S. remains committed to close cooperation with Brunei with the goal of expanding our trade relationship here at the WTO, as well as bilaterally and regionally through [the] TransPacific Partnership (TPP), Wilson . Brunei is among the dozen countries in the AsiaPacific region participating in negotiations on the proposed TPP. Twoway trade between the U.S. and Brunei totaled $576 million in 2013, up from $244 million in 2012. U.S. foreign direct investment in Brunei increased to $132 million in 2013, up 14 percent from $116 million in the  prior. Brunei economy grew at an average annual rate of 0.2 percent between 2008 and 2013, and real GDP growth is expected to be 5.3 percent in 2014, the WTO report . SOE Influence The U.S. noted that the public sector continues to have a direct influence on Brunei economy via an assortment of stateowned enterprises (SOEs) in sectors like oil and gas, telecommunications, transportation and energy generation. Though these entities have a strong trading component to them, Brunei has not yet notified the WTO Working Party on State Trading Enterprises about its state trading enterprises, the U.S. . We look forward to receiving more information about these enterprises from Brunei, as well as an update when Brunei will submit its notification to the WTO, the U.S. statement . The U.S.  that it was also interested in knowing whether Brunei would seek membership in the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. Trade Facilitation, IP Enforcement The U.S. hailed Brunei submission of a category A notification for the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and requested a timeline for Brunei ratification of the accord. Brunei eCustoms trade facilitation program, which permits trading partners to submit electronic applications, has been fully operational since 2008, the WTO report . The U.S. also commended steps Brunei has taken to improve the enforcement of intellectual property rights and has sought further information on any potential changes to Brunei geographical indication system. Brunei established an intellectual property office, enacted a new patent law in 2011 and acceded to three World Intellectual Property Organization treaties since its last trade policy review.',\n",

The Trade Policy Review is the process, mandated by the WTO, which examines the trade and related policies of all WTO Members. The review is facilitated by a chair and discussant, whose roles are to highlight key points from the review and stimulate discussion. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Senator Maxine McClean, in addressing the forum, explained to the membership that the economic recession, which came about as a result of circumstances beyond Barbados control, had a significant impact on the economy. She highlighted some of the programmes and projects being instituted to reposition the economy, including a comprehensive set of policies to encourage greater use of renewable energy, and the development of energyefficient projects and programmes to reduce energy costs. Senator McClean also pointed out that Barbados trade policies had sought to bring balance to the economy and encourage the growth of manufacturing and the international business and financial services sectors. The Discussant for the Review, Ambassador Tan Yee Woan of Singapore, lauded Barbados ability to sustain a high quality of wellbeing despite the grave challenges posed, and noted that Barbados Government nurtured a businessfriendly operational environment. Twentytwo of the countries present made interventions and contributors to the discussion included Barbados main trading partners namely the United States, the European Union, Canada, and China; CARICOM partners, Jamaica and the OECS; as well as India, Nigeria and Costa Rica. The importance of flexibilities for small, vulnerable economies like Barbados was noted by members, and the country was also lauded for its resilience in the face of the devastating effects of the global recession. Praise was also given to Barbados for its Medium Term Growth and Development Strategy, 20132020. In the closing session on January 29, Minister McClean expanded on a number of initiatives being pursued by Barbados, including the National Agricultural Health and Food Control Programme; the modernisation of the Customs Department; and public procurement practices and procedures.

The investigations are in response to a complaint from Domtar Corporation, Finch Paper LLC, Packaging Corporation of America, and P.H. Glatfelter Company which alleged that papers from China, Australia, Brazil Indonesia and Portugal were sold below the fair value of the products in the U.S. market. The company also claimed that exporters from China and Indonesia also received improper government subsidies. Uncoated paper is typically used for office copy and printer paper, books, business forms, instruction manuals, inserts, flyers, brochures and maps. The International Trade Commission (ITC), the U.S. trade authority, was scheduled to make its preliminary inquiry determinations on AD and CVD around March 9. The probes will continue if the ITC determines that the imports of such products materially injure or threaten the domestic industry of the United States.

Any move by Malaysian authorities to encourage biodiesel consumption could fuel another rally in Bursa palm futures , which jumped 9 percent last week after Jakarta  it would boost subsidies for biodiesel nearly threefold. Representatives of Malaysia biodiesel industry will meet the plantation industries and commodities minister Douglas Uggah Embas in Putrajaya on Thursday to discuss what could be done to help the ailing sector. Biodiesel demand took a hit after crude oil prices tumbled more than 50 percent from a peak in June last , wiping out profit margins for blending palm oil into diesel. \"We are unlikely to get anything similar to what Indonesians have got because Malaysia is moving away from subsidies,\"  one industry source who will be part of the delegation meeting the minister, noting that the government had recently removed subsidies on gasoline and diesel. \"The producers are looking for some sort of tax incentives, which would be really helpful,\" the source . The Indonesian government proposal to ramp up biodiesel subsidies overcame the final parliamentary hurdle on Friday, an Indonesian energy ministry official , with the increase possibly taking effect next month. Indonesia is looking to protect its fledgling biofuel industry against lower crude prices and the increase in the subsidies could potentially boost demand for palm oil. Last , Malaysia abolished export tariffs on crude palm oil to boost shipments, prompting a similar move by Indonesia. Indonesia and Malaysia, the world top two producers of palm oil used largely as a cooking oil account for 85 percent of global output of the commodity. Some analysts and industry officials  Malaysia might not act quickly to buttress its bleeding renewable fuel industry. \"Indonesia policy and its ability to act on biodiesel industry has been much more efficient than Malaysia,\"  one commodities analyst who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. While implementation of a mandatory 7 percent blend of biodiesel in Malaysian transport diesel faced major delays, for example, Jakarta energy ministry in 2014 raised the mandate for its transport sector to 10 percent, up from 310 percent previously. \"Besides subsidy schemes, government incentive programmes, and the blending mandates, we definitely need more progression,\"  David Ng of Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur. \"B10 is in talks, but implementation is still anybody guess,\" he , referring to a policy that would mandate a 10 percent minimum bio content in diesel.

Imposed in August, the embargo covers imports of meats, fruits and vegetables, fish, and dairy products from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway and the United States. The move came in retaliation over a raft of Western sanctions imposed on Russia following its March 2014 annexation of Ukraine Crimean peninsula and subsequent meddling in eastern Ukraine. Poland is asking the EU for around 26 million euros ($29 million) in compensation for the losses its farmers incurred because of the embargo. Protesting farmers are asking for compensation for depressed diary and pork prices but also for damages caused by wild boar to their crops and livestock. Before the sanctions, Russia absorbed seven percent of Polish agricultural exports in 2013, with 86 percent going to fellow EU members, notably neighbouring Germany, according to the Polish agriculture ministry. \"I\\'m here to protest because pork farming has become unprofitable,\"  a 40something pig farmer from the central town of Lowicz who refused to reveal his name.

       " \"Australia Implements TRIPS Agreement, Streamlines IP Arrangements with New Zealand By Murray Griffin WTO Reporter, February 12, 2015 Feb. 11 The Australian Senate on Feb. 9 passed legislation to implement a WTO intellectual property agreement and streamline arrangements with New Zealand for assessing and issuing patents. The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill passed Feb. 9 with the support of both major parties. The bill would amend the Patents Act of 1990 to implement the WTO Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement), in line with a commitment made by the Australian government in 2007. Implementation of TRIPS means that Australian laboratories will be able to apply to the Federal Court for a compulsory license to manufacture generic versions of patented medicines and to export them to developing countries to help fight health crises. John Lee, a Sydneybased partner in the law firm of Gilbert & Tobin, told Bloomberg BNA that the legislation would establish a sensible regime for implementing TRIPS that reflected extensive consultation with industry and other experts. For example, the compulsory licensing regime is going to be administered by the Federal Court rather than the patent office or some government official, he told Bloomberg BNA by phone Feb. 11. I think that is a sound regime, the Federal Court is experienced in dealing with intellectual property issues and is obviously quite neutral in its approach, he . IP Harmonization With New Zealand The bill also would introduce a single patent application and examination process and joint patent attorney regime for Australia and New Zealand, subject to the passage of similar legislation in New Zealand. Under the single examination model, if separate patent applications for the same invention are filed in both Australia and New Zealand, then both applications can be considered by a single examiner in either country. The regime would take account of the separate national laws and would lead to the granting of separate patents in Australia and New Zealand, but according to Lee that is likely to be only a first step. I am sure this is part of a process of continuing harmonization in the law, so that at some point in the not too distant future you will have an Australian and New Zealand patent that provides protection across both countries. The bill comprises five schedules, two of which deal with TRIPS and another with introducing the streamlined arrangements with New Zealand. Another schedule would allow the Federal Circuit Court to hear disputes over alleged infringements of plant breeders' rights, while the fifth contains miscellaneous amendments.\",\n",

Speaking in India, Lew  the U.S. economy had turned the corner but the rest of the world needed to do more to revive growth. He urged Europe to make greater use of fiscal policy to reinforce monetary stimulus to boost growth. Lew remarks reinforced a message he gave to G20 finance ministers in Istanbul on Tuesday, but stopped short of naming any countries suspected of competitive currency devaluations. The euro has weakened against the U.S. dollar following the announcement of 1 trillion euros in stimulus measures by the European Central Bank, while China and commodity exporters, such as Australia, have also seen currency weakness of late. In an interview with NDTV Profit, Lew drew a distinction between policies of quantitative easing, which seek to stimulate credit and growth, and those targeting the exchange rate to gain an \"unfair trade advantage\". \"We have been clear, that kind of unfair policy is something that we will oppose and we will push back very hard on,\" Lew told the financial news channel. \"It would be a very big mistake for the world to get into a situation where ... there is kind of a race to devalue.\" He  the U.S. economy had \"turned a corner\", and was showing sustained growth in jobs, wage increases and a recovery in housing and manufacturing. \"What we have now in the U.S. is the kind of recovery that will feed on itself and grow, but we can\\'t look at the U.S. as if it is an island all by itself,\"  Lew. \"So we are very much concerned that there needs to be more growth in other parts of the global economy as well.\" In contrast, Lew , Europe was reluctant to use fiscal tools to lift growth because some countries did not have room to do so, while the continent faced \"real challenges\" to stabilise Ukraine and Greece. \"Having deployed the monetary policy tools, I think were Europe to use some of its fiscal space to grow demand, it would actually make monetary policy more effective,\"  Lew. \"It will help to get the economy moving.\" Lew spoke in Mumbai, the financial capital, on the first day of a twoday visit to India.

Greece 240 billion euro ($270 billion) EUIMF bailout is due to expire at the end of February and failure to agree an extension would see Greece default on its giant debts, almost inevitably meaning that it would crash out of the euro. \"We had intense and constructive discussions but there was not enough progress at this point to reach joint conclusions,\" Dijsselbloem told a news conference after the talks. \"We will continue our talks on Monday and that as far as I can go at this point.\" The talks in Brussels on Monday would probably be the last chance before any new deal could be put to national parliaments for approval before the current bailout ends. New Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose hardleft Syriza party stormed to victory in elections on January 25, has vowed to tear up the bailout programme and end austerity measures imposed under it. \"The extension of the agreement has not been accepted,\" a Greek government source in Athens  after the talks, adding that negotiations would continue with the aim of \"a mutually beneficial agreement\" for Greece economy. But the new Greek government has faced fierce opposition from its European partners, especially the austerityfocused economic powerhouse Germany. The main task in Brussels for Varoufakis a former economics professor whose stylish tartan scarf and untucked shirt contrasted with the suits worn by his colleagues had been to lay out Greece new debt plan. \"This was my first Eurogroup meeting, it was fascinating,\" Varoufakis told reporters. \"We had the opportunity to hear a lot of views and now we are proceeding to the next meeting which will be on Monday hoping that by the end of that one there going to be a conclusion to the deliberations in a manner that is both optimal to Greece and our European partners.\" The Greek proposal would see Athens stick to 70 percent of its bailout reform commitments but overhaul the remaining 30 percent. Greece also wants a debt swap that will free up funds for economic growth. Crucially, the government wants a bridging loan until September to buy time to hammer out new reforms. At the same time it insists on raising the minimum wage and ditching an unpopular property tax, reversing key reforms demanded by the EU and IMF of previous Greek governments. It also wants to ditch inspections by the hated troika of creditors the European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank. Tsipras announced plans on Wednesday to draw up a new programme of reforms with the OECD the economic club of rich nations that has criticised the EU embrace of austerity. Varoufakis meanwhile met with International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Christine Lagarde before he sat down with the ministers, hoping to win the backing of Greece other major creditor from the bailouts that began in 2010. European stocks pulled back on the continuing unease over Greece, with the Athens market slumping four percent, while US stocks were little changed as investors awaited the outcome of the Brussels talks. But Greece has also ramped up threats to look to Russia or China for help, further raising the stakes for European unity as it wrestles with economic stagnation and the crisis in Ukraine. Tsipras has been invited to Beijing to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang, a government source  Wednesday.

       " 'Swiss outline plans to curb immigration from EU Madison Marriage in Zurich Financial Times February 11, 2015 9:46 pm Switzerland has outlined how it will apply immigration curbs first backed in a referendum 12 months ago prompting condemnation from the financial and pharmaceutical sectors. Zurich also pledged to renegotiate a free movement of persons agreement, in force with the EU since 1999, which enables nationals on both sides to move freely between the two territories. Switzerland is not a member of the EU. Under the measures unveiled on Wednesday, which will require parliamentary approval, quotas will apply to foreign workers who are in Switzerland for more than four months, while recruitment priority will be given to Swiss residents. Ministers want to maximise the use of the Swiss workforce by encouraging more women and older individuals into the workforce. Swiss banks and pharmaceutical companies, which tend to hire a high number of staff from the EU, have been outspoken in their opposition to the move to limit immigration from the bloc since the referendum. One executive in the Swiss financial services industry, who requested anonymity, : This is an  topic and it will be very difficult to get a solution with the EU. The pharmaceutical and finance industries will be very affected by this. I think they will cope but it will be much more complicated for them and they will be at a disadvantage to corporations in other countries. Roche, the Swiss drugs group, : It is essential for Roche to be able to attract the most talented people globally to Switzerland. Eleanor TaylorJolidan, a Genevabased fund manager added: One of the strengths of Swiss companies is their very international staff. Look how international top Swiss company CEOs are, not because there is a dearth of quality in Switzerland but because nominations may be less political and more meritocratic than in some countries. Curbs are unhelpful. Switzerland already enforces quotas on immigrants from nonEU states but, under the free movement of persons agreement, bloc nationals are entitled to move freely to Switzerland. Just over half of Switzerlands voters backed an initiative put forward by the ultraconservative Swiss Peoples party requiring the government to extend the quota system to cover arrivals from EU states. The Swiss Bankers Association : The banks are employing many people from other European countries and they need swift access to specialised staff today and tomorrow. The banks are therefore calling for a reliable, pragmatic implementation [of these measures]. However, one senior banker, who asked to remain anonymous, doubted whether the new Swiss proposals will ever become reality. He : It will never be implemented. It is just a way to break the current standstill.',\n",
       " 'Maid abuse case highlights plight of migrant workers Dennis CHONG 11 February 2015 Agence France Presse Foreign maids in Hong Kong are guaranteed wages and benefits rare elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East, but the recent ordeal of an Indonesian domestic helper has highlighted the abuses that still go on behind closed doors. A sixweek trial that saw a Hong Kong woman convicted of beating and starving Erwiana Sulistyaningsih has shone a spotlight on the financial hub 300,000 maids, with campaigners hoping the ruling will convince more to speak out about abuse. And while some argue the city is far ahead of much of Asia and the Middle East in its treatment of migrant maids, critics say lax enforcement and poor support mean domestic helpers are either afraid to speak out or unaware of where to look for help. \"I don\\'t think there is any reason to rejoice,\" Hans Ladegaard, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, told AFP. \"Erwiana may have won the court case, (but) her case is unfortunately far from exceptional,\"  Ladegaard, who has been collecting cases of domestic worker abuse since 2008 as part of an academic project. A Hong Kong judge on Tuesday found Sulistyaningsih employer Law Wantung guilty of 18 charges of physical abuse and a failure to pay wages, saying the Indonesian was effectively kept prisoner. Sulistyaningsih told the court in vivid detail how she was \"tortured\", starved, beaten and humiliated by her former employer. She later told journalists she was happy with the ruling, but voiced hope for reforms in Hong Kong, calling on employers to treat \"migrant domestic workers as workers and human beings and stop treating us like slaves\". In a 2013 survey of more than 3,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, nearly a fifth  they had experienced some form of physical abuse, while 58 percent  they had endured verbal abuse. Six percent  they had suffered sexual abuse. The same , Amnesty International condemned the \"slaverylike\" conditions faced by thousands of Indonesian women who work as domestic staff in Hong Kong and accused authorities of \"inexcusable\" inaction. Local campaigning group HK Helpers has identified three issues in particular need of reform: the enforcement of maximum working hours, stopping illegal agency fees, and ending rules that gives domestic workers only two weeks to find new employers if they quit. But others say that Hong Kong does more than most to protect its domestic workers, with laws requiring employers to provide a minimum wage, days off, and medical insurance which are rare in other countries. The International Labour Organization  in 2013 that just three percent of Asian countries awarded migrant maids weekly days off, and no Middle Eastern countries did. Only 12 percent of Asia, meanwhile, guarantees minimum wages for domestic helpers, a figure that stands at just one percent in the Middle East, according to the ILO. Under the controversial \"kafala\" (sponsorship) system that several Arab states enforce, migrant domestic workers are left completely at the mercy of their employers. It restricts workers from moving to a new job before their contracts end unless they obtain their employer consent, trapping many in abusive situations. While on the surface the legal protection that Hong Kong offers domestic workers may be better, enforcement remains lax. \"Structurally it (Hong Kong) has things in place, reasonable labour laws for migrants domestic workers, but the rule of law stands only if it works. But it doesn\\'t,\" Londonbased Amnesty International researcher Norma Kang Muico told AFP. \"Hong Kong is relatively better,\" Laadegard echoed, \"The main problem is that the laws are often not enforced.\" \"It happens every day. Physical assault on domestic helpers is shockingly common. And the majority of abuse cases don\\'t go to court, not even to the police,\" he added. One positive to emerge from Sulistyaningsih case in the eyes of activists, however, is that when the case did go to trial, it encouraged other helpers to speak out. \"I think that the fact that Erwiana case has reached this far is already a very fine example where a domestic worker has come forward and asserted her rights has demanded justice,\"  local rights activist Eman Villanueva. According to Cynthia Tellez, who runs two shelters in the city for domestic workers who have suffered abuse, more than a thousand maids visited the facilities in the past  alone, and more were speaking out in general. \"There is one good sign that more maids are willing to speak out,\" she told AFP. \"But it also shows that Erwiana is not an isolated case.\" \"The problem has to be seriously addressed.\" END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'Ministry: Subsidies comply with WTO rules Zhong Nan 13 February 2015 China Daily China measures to offer subsidies to manufacturers in certain industries is in conformity with World Trade Organization rules and will help the country ship more quality products to the world market, the Ministry of Commerce  on Thursday. The comment came after the Office of the United States Trade Representative challenged China at the WTO on Wednesday, claiming that the Chinese government offers subsidies for the exports of seven industries through \"demonstration bases\" that receive free or discounted services from suppliers. . The US claimed China has paid the suppliers almost $1 billion over three  to provide computer and training services. Given current global economic conditions, building model manufacturing bases and public service platforms to offer subsidies to cashstarved domestic companies is a practical way for them to seek and gain new market growth points, as well as improving the technical content and environmental protection standards of their products, the ministry  in a statement on Thursday. The ministry expressed its regret over the matter and  all disputes will be resolved under the WTO rules. Analysts  the US\\' chances of winning its complaint at the WTO over alleged Chinese export subsidies to seven domestic industries are mixed. \"This case continues the broader trend of the US and other trading partners challenging the subsidies and other preferential treatment that the Chinese government has provided to domestic enterprises through the WTO. Judging from its track record, the US has a reasonably good chance of winning this case as the WTO has upheld the US complaint in most subsidyrelated cases it has filed against China since the country joined the WTO in 2001,\" Ka Zeng, professor of political science at the University of Arkansas, told China Daily in an email. Zeng has written on China, trade and the US. Zeng  the subsidies cited by the US resemble in part tax breaks that local, state and the federal governments hand over to American firms. \"While providing domestic companies with a competitive advantage just as tax breaks that US companies receive from federal, state and local governments, what raised the salience of these subsidies to the US is that they are often used as instruments of industrial policy to foster the growth of industries with strong ties with the state,\" Zeng . The seven sectors of the Chinese economy involved with the subsidies cited by the US complaint are textiles, apparel and footwear; advanced materials and metals (including specialty steel, titanium and aluminum products); light industry; specialty chemicals; medical products; hardware and building materials, and agriculture. Zeng did not think this case will directly affect negotiations for a TransPacific Partnership since China is not a participant in the talks. TPP is a proposed freetrade deal covering the US, Canada and 10 countries in the AsiaPacific region (not including China) that has been under discussion since 2005. \"However, the initiation of this case may help the Obama administration demonstrate its tough stand in trade negotiations in order to garner support for Congressional approval of the socalled fasttrack negotiation authority that is sorely needed for TPP negotiations,\" she added. Last , the WTO sided with the US in at least two trade disputes. In June, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing extra duties on US cars and sport utility vehicles. In August, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing duties and quotas on exports of rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum. Those export restraints promote China own industry and discriminate against US companies using those materials, it .',\n",

That support is now at the heart of the latest U.S. complaint over trade practices. The U.S. initiated a case Feb. 11 at the World Trade Organization accusing China of making companies in seven industries eligible for incentives for computer or training services at the bases, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman . Free or discounted services provided to exporters in the zones undermine fair competition, he . China Ministry of Commerce started the bases, officially known as foreign trade transformation and upgrading demonstration bases, in 2011 with the purpose of accelerating China foreign trade growth model and promoting China as a powerful trading country. The first batch of 59 bases was announced in August 2011, the second batch of 58 in December 2012, and the third batch of 62 in December 2013. The bases are scattered across the countryfrom home textiles in Lhasa, Tibet, to a jeansmaking base in Guangzhou. In a 2011 plan, the commerce ministry  the bases will become powerful exportdriven zones in five to 10  to provide forceful support to the country foreign trade. Exporters in the bases can receive support in terms of personnel training, market information, product innovation, quality improvement, branding, marketing, promotion, trade relief and trade facilitation, according a statement from the ministry. Local governments can add their own subsidies to the bases endorsed by the ministry, or directly create provinciallevel or municipallevel bases. For instance, the provincial government of Guangdong assigned 20 million yuan ($3.2 million) in 2012 to develop such bases, the official Southern Daily reported. In Dongguan, China export heartland, the municipal government will provide 2 million yuan in subsidies annually to the demonstration base there to aid product design, exhibition and training programs, according to an official document on the government website.',\n",

The hammer strikes May 1 if mandatory countryoforigin labelling (mCOOL) legislation isn\\'t changed, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz says. \"We import $400 million in California wines (annually),\" he  this week during a stop in Southwestern Ontario, one of Canada richest farm belts and a major livestock producer. \"We\\'ve got a great wine industry right here in Ontario, so that an easy one to target for retaliation. I know that one (threat) that brought a lot of the California congressmen and senators online, saying \\'Don\\'t do that, please.\\' And we say, \\'Talk to your administration.\\' \" Monday, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva will start hearing the U.S. appeal of a WTO decision that says the labelling legislation violates trade agreements among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Ritz led a delegation to Washington last week in advance of that hearing. \"I came back very optimistic that we\\'ll see some very positive changes, sooner rather than later,\" he told The Free Press. The U.S. rules require store packaging identify where the animal meat was born, raised and slaughtered. But if a pork chop started as a piglet in Canada, but was raised in the U.S., the slaughterhouse must have separate processing lines to ensure that hog will be separately labelled in the supermarket. That onerous, costly and timeconsuming something few slaughterhouses want or can afford,  Bill Wymenga, a Chathamarea pork farmer and vicechair of the Canadian Pork Council. The net effect has been to devalue Canadian meats in the U.S., costing the livestock industry more than $1 billion a , opponents say. \"It a very effective nontariff trade barrier,\" Wymenga . While many U.S. beef lobbyists have applauded the rules, some livestock groups call them shortsighted and potentially devastating if Canada retaliates. Wymenga was part of the Ritz delegation to Washington and  the reception was more positive than in previous . \"The mood this time is different. They realize they\\'re probably going to lose this case and there are going to be some repercussions.\" Canada is looking for WTO approval to apply $2 billion in tariffs on American goods if the labelling legislation isn\\'t repealed. Wymenga  those threatened tariffs are \"the big stick,\" particularly in 37 states that need Canada as their No. 1 export market.

The agreement to end the nearly long conflict, which has killed thousands and ratcheted EastWest tensions to highs not seen since the Cold War, was reached early Thursday after marathon talks in the Belarussian capital Minsk between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of stoking the war in exSoviet Ukraine by pouring arms and troops to help the proRussian rebels fighting Kiev government troops in Ukraine industrial east. Moscow denies the charges. Speaking late Thursday after a European Union summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Russia that the bloc, which has already slapped Moscow with sanctions over the crisis, was not ruling out further measures if the truce failed. \"If it works well we would be very happy to go with the agreement. If there are difficulties we wouldn\\'t rule out other sanctions,\" she . French President Francois Hollande, who along with Merkel attended the 17hour talks in Minsk that also included Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, agreed. If the ceasefire deal was not respected, \"we would return to a process... of sanctions that would be in addition to those already in place.\" Hollande also  that the conditions were not yet right for France to resume with the delivery of two Mistral warships to Russia, a 1.2billioneuro sale that Paris was forced to suspend over the Ukraine crisis. Under the deal reached in Minsk, a ceasefire is to take effect at midnight Kiev time on Sunday (2200 GMT on Saturday) and heavy weapons are to be withdrawn from the frontlines of the conflict, which has killed at least 5,300 people and driven a million people from their homes since erupting in April 2014. Poroshenko described the 17hour talks as \"very difficult\" and  he expected the implementation of the deal would not be easy. Brussels first imposed targeted sanctions on individuals after Russia annexation of Crimea in March 2014 but adopted tougher economic measures after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in July. European Council President Donald Tusk  Poroshenko had given EU leaders a \"sobering assessment\" of the deal, and  the 28member bloc was ready \"to take the necessary steps\" to keep up the pressure on Russia. \"Our trust in the goodwill of President Putin is limited, this is why we have to maintain our decision on sanctions,\" he told a press conference. The United States, which has  it could supply Ukraine with weapons if the conflict continues, cautiously welcomed the peace accord, but emphasised the work yet to be done in making it stick. \"The true test of today accord will be in its full and unambiguous implementation,\" the White House , including \"restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia.\" The Ukrainian government accused Russia of deploying another 50 tanks across the border during the talks in Minsk, with fighting expected to continue around disputed railway hub Debaltseve, which rebels claim to have surrounded. The roadmap was signed by Russian and Ukrainian envoys, separatist leaders and European mediators from the OSCE. A previous truce signed in Minsk last September quickly collapsed. Beset by war and corruption, Ukraine proWestern government is struggling to enact legal and economic reforms that would help steer the former Soviet republic out of Russia sphere of influence and into Western institutions. The Kiev government got a major boost Thursday with the announcement by IMF chief Christine Lagarde of a new financial rescue plan worth $17.5 billion. In total, Ukraine will receive $40 billion (35 billion euros) in assistance over four  coupled with bilateral loans from other sources, Lagarde , helping to stabilise Kiev finances after 10 months of conflict in the east. The World Bank for its part announced it was prepared to provide up to $2 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine this . The new Minsk agreement is broadly similar to the first one, except that the new heavy weaponsfree zone will be 50 to 70 kilometres (3143 miles) wide, depending on the range of the weapon, double the width of the buffer zone agreed in September. Kiev will also begin retaking control over the approximately 400kilometre (250 mile) stretch of Russia border with rebelheld Ukraine, but only after local elections are held. The border is entirely under Russian and proRussian rebel control and is used, according to Kiev, as a conduit for separatist supplies. The Kremlin denies this but has opposed Ukraine being allowed to regain control of the frontier. While heavy weapons must be withdrawn, troops and rebels can remain where they are, handing rebels de facto control of the roughly 500 square kilometres of territory they\\'ve gained in recent weeks. Separatistheld territories will be granted a degree of autonomy to be established through talks, and the right to decide which language they use.',\n",

Passing currency legislation like that which was introduced this week in the House and the Senate would likely lead to a tariff war that increases trade barriers and costs jobs, put the United States at risk of violating WTO rules, make the nation vulnerable to lawsuits that jeopardize its ability to set monetary policy, threaten the dollars standing as the worlds leading currency and derail the TransPacific Partnership agreement, the Republican blog . And for all the downside, it probably wont work, they added.

       " 'Protectionist trade actions don\\'t help the poor AARES 12 February 2015 Fuseworks Media FUSMED Trade policy adjustments to insulate domestic markets when world food prices spike have been ineffective in dealing with food price shocks that exposed millions of people to poverty in developing countries, a World Bank researcher told a New Zealand agricultural economics conference this week. Dr Will Martin, the manager for agriculture and rural development research in the World Bank is an Australian who has worked for the Washingtonbased World Bank for the past 25 . He is also PresidentElect of the International Association of Agricultural Economists. He was speaking to more than 250 international delegates attending the Australian Agricultural & Resource Economics Society conference in Rotorua this week. His analysis of detailed expenditure and agricultural production data from 31 developing countries assesses the impacts of changes in global food prices on poverty in an effort to understand their impacts on the poor. Food price increases unrelated to productivity changes in developing countries raise poverty in the short run in all but a few countries. \"That because the poor spend large shares of their incomes frequently about 6070 percenton food and many poor farmers are net buyers of food,\" he says. \"However, in the longer run, if prices stay high, two other  factors come into play. Poor workers are likely to benefit from increases in wage rates for unskilled workers resulting from higher food prices, and poor farmers are likely to benefit from higher agricultural profits as they produce more food. As a result, higher food prices appear to lower global poverty in the long run.\" He says a natural and understandable policy reaction for many countries when food prices rise is to lower domestic prices through levies on exports, temporary import tariff reductions, or import subsidies. \"But these are beggarthyneighbour policies that push up world prices,\" he says. He estimates that these policies accounted for nearly half the increase in world rice prices in 20078. Individually, most countries took action that reduced the impact of higher world prices on the poor. But, when the contribution of these policies to the higher world prices is taken into account, they turn out to have been ineffective. \"What countries need is a collective approach that enables relatively open trade to continue in those circumstances. Clearly, this still needs to be combined with social safety nets so poor people can cope in the short term, but then realise the longer term benefits of higher prices. We need to deliver policies that actually work rather than policies that appear to work.\" Dr Martin says countries need to develop this social safety net\\' so the poorest can get access to what they need when they need it. He says the World Trade Organisation (WTO) showed with the abolition of variable import levies in the Uruguay Round that it can introduce trade policies that bring about the kind of collective action needed to tame food price spikes. \"The collective agreement of the EUUS over export subsidies in the Uruguay Round also showed what can be done when there is clear recognition of the problem. It much more complex when many more countries are involved but we need to keep working away at the challenge if we are to make progress. Getting the confidence of policymakers to act differently will require a lot more research and policy formulation.\"',\n",

The idea of imposing carbon pollution targets on each industry has appeared in the lengthy negotiating text that representatives from more than 190 countries began working on in Geneva this week. The measure is being backed by countries in the EU, which fought a bruising battle three  ago to make international airlines flying to and from Europe pay for their carbon pollution. Brussels eventually reined in its scheme, confining it to flights within the EU, after it sparked a diplomatic row with some of its largest trading partners, including China and the US. An additional proposal in the Paris negotiating text would encourage international air and shipping bodies to develop a levy scheme to help countries adapt to climate change. Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions that the Paris deal is supposed to reduce, but the measure is expected to be opposed by many countries. Still, some envoys in Geneva  they were pleased to see it on the table. Were happy to see it being discussed,  Mary Ann Lucille Sering of the Philippines, adding her countrys many islands meant air travel was  but it was a relatively small market compared with other nations. Including shipping and aviation emissions in a global climate deal has proved difficult in the past. The last big climate pact, the Kyoto protocol agreed in 1997, required rich countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions but did not include pollution from ships or aircraft, partly because it occurs around the world rather than in a single country. Instead, it was left to each industrys specialist UN agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization, to develop a global plan to address emissions. ICAO is working on a proposal due to be considered in 2016 and a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, the aviation industrys main body,  the process was going well and had been recognised by countries in the UN climate talks. The industry is fully supporting ICAOs work in this area, the spokesman , adding Iatas members had agreed a resolution in 2013 calling on governments to develop a global marketbased measure in line with its commitment to carbonneutral growth from 2020. But some say progress is still far too slow and the move to include aviation emissions in particular in the Paris deal is welcome. Bill Hemmings, aviation and shipping programme manager at the Brusselsbased Transport & Environment research organisation,  that with aviation and shipping each accounting for about 3 per cent of global C02 emissions, and with air travel in particular growing fast, it was time both sectors faced targets to limit their pollution. How can we have large countries like China and the US, and developing countries making commitments to cut their emissions while these two sit on their hands? he . The issue is not even on the agenda of the IMO, the UNs shipping body. ICAO has promised action by 2016 but operates in complete secrecy. Both sectors are exempt from fuel tax so a levy on emissions to help countries adapt to climate change makes great sense, Mr Hemmings .',\n",

Just how big is the industry, who are the main players and which are the most soughtafter flowers? Last , flower exports worldwide amounted to $20.6 billion annually, according to a report from Rabobank last month, a slight decrease from $21.1 billion in 2011. Americans alone will spend $2.1 billion on flowers this , the National Retail Federation  last month. Among holidays, Valentine Day saw the highest fresh flower purchases in 2014, capturing 36 percent of total U.S. holiday transactions, data from industry website AboutFlowers showed. What hot Red roses are traditionally the most soughtafter flower, but demand for others including tulips, Peruvian lilies, chrysanthemums and minicarnations is also high, the Society of American Florists  on its website. \"A rose is a truly global product. Behind every Valentine Day rose, there is an extensive network of people from all over the world from the farmer, shipper, auctioneer and retailer all cooperating to transport roses from field to hand in a matter of days,\"  Alex Tabarrok, economist at George Mason University, in a new video on education website MRUniversity. Major players The Netherlands is the world largest exporter of flowers, accounting for 52 percent of the world cut flowers last , thanks to numerous large greenhouses across the countryside, Rabobank . However, the Dutch share in global flower exports is declining as lowcost competitors like Kenya, Ethiopia, Ecuador, and Colombia, quickly catch up in production. \"Growers in these countries are able to achieve largescale production of goodquality flowers for competitive prices,\" Rabobank stated. \"Highcost growers who do not want to sit on thorns need to differentiate themselves from lowcost countries, or become active in these lowcost regions.\" Colombia was ranked the world second largest exporter in 2013 with a $1 billion floral industry, according to government agency ProColombia. Rise of China Asia isn\\'t typically represented among flower producing nations but China Yunnan province has the potential to become a leader in floriculture worldwide, PMA Research  earlier this month. Yunnan Dounan Flower Market is Asia largest flower market, according to Chinese media reports, and sells up to 12 million flowers daily. \"The biggest obstacle to reaching the European and North American markets is logistics. The opening of Kunming Changshui International Airport in 2012 addressed some of those obstacles with increasing access to Europe and cargo capacity that is expected to reach 950,000 tons annually by 2020,\" PMA  in a note.

It says unfairly low prices had been hurting Chinese companies. The pipes are used for power plant boilers. Japan  the Chinese duties violated WTO rules because there were no manufacturers of similar highgrade products in China.

Safeguard duties are emergency tariffs that a country can impose temporarily to shield a specific sector from a sudden and damaging surge in imports.

Last fall, Ottawa filed a complaint with the WTO over Chinese levies on Canadian dissolving pulp, which is used to make rayon for clothing and other products. But the Chinese investigation into Canada concerns had flaws because it did not follow WTO rules, International Trade Minister Ed Fast alleged Thursday. \"Due to the inability to resolve this matter through ongoing engagement with China, Canada is requesting the establishment of a WTO panel,\" Fast . WTO tribunals adjudicate disputes between member countries. The panel will then produce a report that says whether it believes the complaints were well founded. The Chinese duties on Canadian pulp can reach as high as 23.7 per cent. They were imposed against several companies, including Fortress Paper and Tembec. China first imposed the duties in November 2013 against Canada, the United States and Brazil, claiming the imports hurt its domestic pulp market. They became permanent in April 2014. Fast  the Chinese measures are discriminatory and put Canadian pulp exporters at a disadvantage. His department  Canadian firms exported $317 million of dissolving pulp to China last .

       " 'U.S. SEEKS WTO CONSULTATIONS WITH CHINA OVER ALLEGED EXPORT SUBSIDY 13 February 2015 Inside U.S. Trade The Obama administration on Feb. 11 took the first step toward launching a new case against China at the World Trade Organization by requesting consultations over a program supporting Chinese manufacturers and producers in seven sectors that the U.S. claims provided more than $1 billion in prohibited export subsidies in violation of trade rules. The U.S. became aware of the new program, which covers sectors such as textiles and agriculture but not autos, while engaged in an earlier set of WTO consultations with Beijing in 2012 over what the U.S. charged were prohibited export subsidies provided to Chinese auto and auto parts manufacturers, according to a U.S. trade official. The official, speaking at a Feb. 12 press briefing on the new WTO challenge, announced that China appears to have removed key measures at issue in those earlier auto consultations (see related story). The subject of the latest round of WTO consultations is a program under which the U.S. alleges China provided free and discounted services as well as cash grants and other incentives to companies operating in 178 industrial clusters known as demonstration bases. In order to receive that support, these companies had to meet certain export performance criteria, according to a USTR press release. The U.S. charges that this amounts to a prohibited export subsidy within the meaning of Article 3.1 of the Agreement of Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM), which prohibits subsidies contingent in law or in fact upon export performance. Specifically, the U.S. is alleging that the subsidies are contingent in law on export performance, the U.S. trade official . The U.S. consultation request list 182 laws and regulations at the central and subcentral government level through which China has implemented this program. The seven sectors that are represented in the demonstration bases are textiles, apparel and footwear; advanced materials and metals; light industry; specialty chemicals; medical products; hardware and building materials; and agriculture. Each demonstration base is typically made up of companies from only one of these sectors, officials . USTR Michael Froman unveiled the new consultation request at a Feb. 11 press event that USTR had billed as a major enforcement announcement. He was flanked by six House Democrats and one House Republican hailing from regions that produce goods covered in the seven sectors. Several of the House members who spoke, including Reps. Mike Thompson (DCA), Charles Boustany (RLA), Jim Costa (DCA) and Scott Peters (DCA), emphasized that strong enforcement of existing trade agreements is necessary in order to build support for new trade deals the U.S. is negotiating such as the TransPacific Partnership (TPP). If we are going to convince our constituents here in the United States American workers and American businesses that these negotiations will be good for country, for our economy, and for the world order of future trade, we have to ensure that our existing trade agreements are being followed, Costa . A U.S. trade official rejected the notion that new consultation request was deliberately timed in order to build support for the presidents trade agenda, saying that these enforcement actions are taken according to their own internal timelines. But one observer supportive of the consultation request charged that the timing is a transparent effort designed to help the administration build support for Trade Promotion Authority and the TPP negotiations. The other House lawmakers who took part in the announcement were Reps. David Price (DNC), Suzan DelBene (DWA) and Derek Kilmer (DWA). Among the prohibited export subsidies that the U.S. is alleging were provided to companies in the demonstration bases are free and discounted services delivered through socalled Common Service Platforms. These include information technology services, product design services and worker training services, Froman  at the press event. The U.S. estimates that China provided $1 billion worth of these subsidized services between 2010 and 2012, according to U.S. trade officials. They  the Demonstration BasesCommon Service Platform program has been in place since at least 2009 or 2010. USTR  in the press release that exports from the demonstration bases comprise a significant portion of Chinas global exports. It noted that exports from 16 of the roughly 40 demonstration bases specializing in the textiles sector amount to $33.25 billion in 2012, accounting for 14 percent of Chinas total textile exports that . Meanwhile, exports from six of the 10 demonstration bases specializing in seafood production totaled $3.59 billion in 2012, making up 20 percent of Chinas seafood exports in that . Because the dispute involves prohibited subsidies, the timeline for the U.S. and China to hold consultations is shorter compared to WTO disputes involving other matters. Specifically, the ASCM requires that, in disputes involving prohibited subsidies, the member alleged to have subsidized shall enter into consultations as quickly as possible. If those consultations fail to resolve the dispute in 30 days from the request, a party can request the establishment of a dispute settlement panel. By contrast, the rules established in the Dispute Settlement Understanding for general WTO disputes require 60 days to elapse before a party can request the establishment of the panel. Asked why the U.S. opted to pursue these subsidy programs in the WTO rather than by selfinitiating a countervailing duty (CVD) case, the U.S. trade official argued that the WTO provides a more sweeping remedy because it allows the U.S. to challenge this program at its roots rather than targeting specific products through CVDs. He noted that a CVD case would likely target a more narrow class of products and therefore require multiple cases, while U.S. through the WTO can target seven broad sectors in one fell swoop. In addition, he indicated that a WTO challenge enables the U.S. to address the impact of Chinas export subsidies in third markets where Chinese and U.S. products compete, whereas CVDs would only address the U.S. market. The official indicated that, prior to requesting the WTO consultations with China, the U.S. discussed its potential case with other WTO members, including Mexico. Those WTO members at the time all expressed an interest in the case the U.S. planned to pursue, and will now decide whether to join the consultations or become third parties to them, the official . Mexico in 2012 requested WTO consultations with China over alleged subsidies for textiles, but has not yet requested a panel in that dispute (Inside U.S. Trade, Oct. 26, 2012). The National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO) and the United Steelworkers praised the administrations consultation request in separate statements as an  step in fighting unfair Chinese trade practices. NCTO welcomed the USTR announcement and  the subsidies at issue have bolstered Chinas meteoric rise of textile and apparel exports since 2001. This surge has cost NCTO members billions of dollars in lost sales and tens of thousands of jobs in the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere, it claims. We applaud the Obama Administration for todays decision to hold our international trading competitors to their WTO obligations, NCTO President Augustine Tantillo  in the statement.',\n",
       " 'Projects can further promote Northeast Asian prosperity Woo Duck Han 14 February 2015 China DailyHong Kong Edition The \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" embody China economic diplomacy under the new leadership led by President Xi Jinping. In particular, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road manifests China recent economic diplomatic initiatives such as neighborhood policy, multilateral cooperation and energy diplomacy. China has become increasingly active in economic diplomacy since becoming a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. And the \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" are an  part of that. The entry into the WTO represented China integration with the international economic community led by the West, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is the hallmark of Xi economic diplomacy. Economic diplomacy contains two opposite aspects: one is to promote economic growth through diplomatic measures, and the other is to achieve a certain diplomatic goal by using economic means. The \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" display both features, but the latter is more prominent. Such a diplomatic strategy is based on China knowledge of and attitude toward its neighbors. The US \"pivot to Asia\" and containment policy and the fact that a growing number of its neighbors are becoming unfriendly or proAmerican are both concerns for China. Some of China neighbors believe that the \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" are an attempt to redress this situation. If China hopes to make the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road strategy a success, it has to dispel their misgivings. To reach the goal, China should first formulate policies that conform to internationally recognized rules rather than those established by China itself. Second, China needs an open policy that does not exclude any individual country or group of countries. Third, an institutionalized decisionmaking system in which all member states can participate should be set up. And most ly, the primary condition is that all neighboring countries should believe that their security is safeguarded. All neighbors are observing China, and counting on it to fulfill its commitments to equality, mutual benefit and safeguarding security as it presses forward with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Among China neighbors, the Republic of Korea is a typical proAmerican country. Its attitude toward the \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" is one of caution, because it has to consider the US position in East Asia. Therefore, it hesitates to be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that is dominated by China and maintains a position of reserve toward the Conference on Interaction and ConfidenceBuilding Measures in Asia. But Seoul will have no reason to refuse joining the AIIB or taking part in confidencebuilding measures in Asia when the conditions are ripe, because both mechanisms will promote economic growth and security in the region. The \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" are actually China \"Go West\" strategy. As a country to China east, the ROK is not involved in this strategy. But the ROK attaches great importance to the plan as the \"New Silk Road\" is in line with the Eurasian initiative proposed by ROK President Park Geunhye, and will help the peaceful development on the Korean Peninsula. Just as we observed at the ASEANRepublic of Korea summit at Busan in the ROK last December, Seoul takes cooperation with the ASEAN members seriously, and actively promotes cooperation projects in energy, infrastructure and national security, which dovetail with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative. So China \"Belt and Road Initiatives\" fit into and are mutually complementary to the ROK economic diplomacy. During his visit to the ROK, Xi Jinping and Park Geunhye agreed to build a \"Belt and Road\" industrial negotiation mechanism and, hence, we expect the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to extend to Busan and Incheon, and contribute to the common development of Northeast Asia.

The WTO various trade negotiation groups have met regularly during the past month to discuss ways to develop a detailed postBali Ministerial work program by July 31. Though members have engaged in discussions aimed at modernizing WTO rules regarding agriculture, nonagricultural market access and service rules, the negotiations have not yet delivered any tangible outcomes (20 WTO, 1/30/15). Members also will discuss the following issues at the Feb. 20 meeting: administration/financial questions, budget, intellectual property, intergovernmental organizations, small and island economies, and trade and development. Fried to Step Down The chairman of the World Trade Organization General Council, Ambassador Jonathan Fried of Canada, is expected to step down following the Feb. 20 General Council meeting. Mexican Ambassador Fernando de Mateo, the current chairman of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), is viewed as Fried likely successor. The WTO DSB chairmen generally become General Council chairmen after their one terms expire, with some exceptions. Though the annual selection process has not yet been formally announced, the handover is expected to take place in late February or March, Geneva trade officials . COOL Appeal Hearing On Feb. 16 and 17 the WTO dispute settlement appellate body will convene an oral hearing in the U.S. countryoforigin labeling (COOL) dispute with Canada and Mexico at 9:30 a.m. in the WTO Centre William Rappard. Last  a WTO dispute settlement panel declared U.S. COOL rules in violation of its international trade obligations (203 WTO, 10/21/14). The WTO ruled that COOL regulations—which require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered—discriminate against other export countries. The regulations also bar the mixing of muscle cuts from different countries under a general label. The U.S. subsequently appealed the decision, citing a series of erroneous legal findings and interpretations. A final appellate decision is expected to come later this spring. Aid for Trade On Feb. 16 the WTO will host an Aid for Trade workshop in preparation for the June 30 to July 2 global review of the program. The WTO will hold a dedicated discussion on electronic commerce policy at 3 p.m. on Feb. 16. The Aid for Trade global review is a biennial joint exercise of the WTO and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the impact of trade on the competitiveness of developing countries.

       " 'Taiwan, Korea, China Plan To Engage In New Talks To End ITA Stalemate Inside U.S. Trade 02/13/2015 Taiwan, South Korea, China and three other World Trade Organization members are set to engage in a new round of \"sixparty\" talks in Geneva led by the WTO directorgeneral to try and salvage a deal to expand the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), according to Taiwan trade minister. John ChenChung Deng, Minister of Economic Affairs for Taiwan, told Inside U.S. Trade in an exclusive interview in Washington that the talks also include the U.S., Japan and the European Union. They have still not yet started, Deng , although he expected them to get underway soon. \"The mechanism is there, but ... we are still expecting the first meeting to be called. It hasn\\'t really started, but we all agree this will be the mechanism to deal with the remaining ITA [items],\" Deng . The ITA expansion talks, which launched in 2012, had remained frozen for most of 2014 in light of China unwillingness to drop tariffs on certain tech goods. But they were unblocked last fall after the U.S. and China reached a bilateral compromise. That deal entailed China agreeing to cut tariffs on major U.S. priorities like advanced semiconductors. But it did not include tariff cuts on flatpanel displays, a key item of commercial interest for both Korea and Taiwan. Although that agreement between Washington and Beijing initially lent some momentum to the ITA expansion talks, it was quickly sapped in the face of objections from Korea and Taiwan, who  a deal without flat panels would not be meaningful enough for their industries. Korea and Taiwan, along with other WTO members, pressed China to accept tariff cuts on additional products that are commercial priorities for Korea and Taiwan in lieu of flatpanel displays. But China  it was unable to negotiate beyond what it had agreed to with the United States (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 19, 2014). When asked whether Taiwan could agree to a deal that did not include flat panels but offered other enticements, Deng declined to respond directly. He also would not say what other items might be of interest to Taipei. \"I can tell you all options are open,\" Deng , \"But we are as anxious as anybody else to have an expanded ITA. We will contribute, but we also hope that the other side will also consider what we need.\" He declined to say what other priority items China could offer up, or to give a timeline for when the ITA expansion negotiations could be concluded. Meanwhile, a Geneva source confirmed that the sixparty process had been set up but was not yet underway. He  the talks would initially focus on addressing Korea demands, in hopes that any deal that it could accept would also be palatable to Taiwan. Deng noted that China has resisted dropping tariffs on flatpanel displays because it wants to build up a domestic flatpanel industry. But he argued that this strategy was counterproductive and pointed to Taiwan experience as evidence. Taiwan is home to Innolux, one of the world largest display makers. \"If you want to establish a new industry, the possible options might be through protection or just open it up and let business compete. Our experience is the latter option is more effective,\" he , adding that Taiwan maintained tariffs on information technology products of below 5 percent even before the original 1996 ITA, which dropped most of them to zero.',\n",
       " 'EGA Round Offers Preview Of Potential Fights Over Product Coverage Inside U.S. Trade 02/13/2015 Last month round of talks for the plurilateral Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) foreshadowed a potential fight that could heat up this spring over whether a final deal should include tariff cuts on goods related to nuclear power, agricultural biofuels such as biodiesel and methanol, and hybrid vehicles. Informed sources  these products were proposed for inclusion by some EGA members during the Jan. 2630 round of talks in Geneva. But these products could end up being controversial among EGA members, for at least two reasons, according to these sources. The first relates to whether these products have \"environmental credibility,\" meaning they actually contribute to environmental protection. The second is whether agricultural products such as biodiesel and methanol should be included within the scope of the EGA, as the deal is generally understood to focus on industrial products. Environmental credibility could become an issue for nuclear power goods, biodiesel, methanol and hybrid vehicles, sources . One Geneva source alluded to the fact that nuclear power is controversial among the general public in some EGA countries due to fears over its safety and environmental impacts. Meanwhile, the environmental benefits of biodiesel and ethanol can vary depending on the production method that is used, this source pointed out. And hybrid vehicles can still produce significant emissions, he noted. The inclusion of agriculture products such as biodiesel and methanol could be controversial since these products are subsidized in some countries, according to one informed source. This source indicated that other EGA countries may object to lowering tariffs on these goods if those subsidies are not addressed. But sources emphasized that these debates have not really begun yet, as EGA members are still in the phase of brainstorming the complete universe of products that will be considered for inclusion in the deal, with the list currently consisting of hundreds of products. They are aiming to complete that list by early April, after which EGA members will begin substantive negotiations on which products should be removed from the list. These sources  negotiators are on track to meet the early April target, although they acknowledged that China has not yet submitted its product nominations for any of the categories that have been discussed to date. Sources  China has not yet submitted any product nominations because it is still undergoing internal consultations. One industry source  China delay is not worrisome, as it has not slowed down the EGA talks thus far. And given the complexity of the Chinese government, this source  it is not unreasonable to think that these internal consultations would take some time. So far, EGA members have discussed product nominations for seven out of the 10 environmental categories that they agreed on at the outset of the talks. They are slated to discuss the final three categories environmental monitoring, analysis and assessment, environmentally preferable products and resource efficiency during the fifth round of talks slated for March 1620 in Geneva. One Geneva source noted that the early April target for compiling the list is a soft deadline, as EGA members would still be able to add and remove products from the list. However, this source signaled that this flexibility would be limited to small numbers of products. Sources indicated that product scope negotiations would begin during the rounds following the April compilation, although one Geneva source  the agenda and format for those talks have not been set. The subsequent negotiating rounds will be held May 48, June 1519 and July 2731, according to a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The United States and other EGA members are pushing for some sort of outcome in the talks by December 2015, although sources  it remains unclear what that would be. They  it could range from an agreed product scope to the conclusion of the entire agreement. One source emphasized that the pace of the product scope negotiations will determine what kind of outcome is possible by the end of this . Such an outcome would coincide with both the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which is being held Nov. 30Dec. 11 in Paris, and the 10th WTO Ministerial, which is set for Dec. 1518 in Nairobi. The Obama administration highlighted the ongoing EGA talks in its National Security Strategy that it released on Feb. 6 as one of the steps the U.S. is taking to address climate change and the global economic situation. Climate change was highlighted as a threat to national security within that report. China is not the only EGA member that has not yet submitted its product nominations. Costa Rica has also not submitted a product list yet, as well as EGA newcomer Israel. Israel was able to participate in the talks following the conclusion of the Obama administration 90day consultation process with Congress earlier last month. Two other countries Turkey and Iceland are set to join the talks in time for the March round. The U.S. 90day consultation process for those countries expire Feb. 18 and March 12, respectively. One Geneva source  EGA participants have been working closely with Israel, Turkey and Iceland to ensure they are familiar with the negotiating process. This source  he expected them to be \"fully up to speed\" after they complete their first round.',\n",
       " 'China Announces It Will Not Expand December GPA Offer To More Entities World Trade Online Posted: February 13, 2015 In an unexpected move, China this week announced to signatories of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) that it does not intend to improve the market access concessions it made in its latest accession offer presented in December 2014, but is willing to negotiate exclusions it has proposed. At a Feb. 11 meeting of the Committee on Government Procurement, China  it is not willing to add any entities to Annexes 13, which cover procurement by central, subcentral, and stateowned enterprises (SOEs), respectively. China also indicated that negotiations should continue on its most recent offer because it was unsure whether another revised offer would be put forward, sources . China also  it hoped other parties would adopt a \"practical attitude\" toward its offer and reminded them it is a developing country while most other GPA signatories are developed nations, Geneva sources . Its refusal to offer more concessions pushes back against longstanding demands by the United States and the European Union that China improve its fifth market access offer circulated on Dec. 23, 2014. The offer was made in the context of China seeking to join the GPA. Overall, other GPA members saw China offer as a positive step forward, but still falling short of what is needed to conclude the negotiations. The U.S.  that China had to improve its December offer in all aspects since it fell short of U.S. requests for more market access and more limited exclusions, Geneva sources . Switzerland called on China to include nonsecurity related contracts from the Ministry of Defense and People Liberation Army. The EU also raised the inclusion of the Ministry of Defense in Annex 1, sources . Other GPA signatories have pressed to expand covered central government entities, increase provincial coverage, and expand its inclusion of SOEs. In his closing statement, the chairman urged parties not forget about the possible benefits of including China in the GPA and asked China to seek new flexibility. Sources  that other parties also urged China to implement new legislation in preparation of joining the GPA, as it currently does not have the legal basis to do so. Switzerland also  that all of China provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions should be included in Annex 2, a point previously raised by the U.S. China most recent offer included five additional provinces for a total 15, along with the four municipalities included in previous offers, one source . The U.S. leverage on this point may be limited because only 37 out of its 50 states are covered by the agreement. Notwithstanding China statements, sources speculated that China may be willing to expand the number of provinces covered by the GPA based on the makeup of the Chinese delegation at the meeting. It included officials from provinces that were not covered in the last GPA offer. One source  that the size and seniority of the delegation was also a positive indication that China is serious about the negotiations. Canada, Japan and the EU specifically criticized China’s refusal to include more SOEs, claiming that China’s offer was not commensurate with that of other participants. Japan  it had covered about 100 SOEs in the GPA and that China offer should be similar in scope. Canada and the EU made the point that most of China’s procurement market was in SOEs and criticized China for a continued refusal to expand its Annex 3 offer, according to Geneva sources. The two exclusions in China’s offer were also the subject of much scrutiny at the meeting as parties claimed they were too broad and far reaching. In its Annex 7 offer, China excluded procurement that would “impair national policy objectives” and offered another exclusion that allows for it to require offset measures such as domestic content requirements or transfers of technology. During the meeting, China outlined the five areas where its December offer ceded more than previous proposals. It cited the reduction of thresholds above which public contracts are open to foreign suppliers; coverage of entities in five additional provinces; initial coverage of 14 more entities; the coverage of five new service sectors; and expanded coverage of construction services. According to informed sources, parties were agreeable to China’s lowering of thresholds above which public contracts are open to foreign suppliers, but still took issue with the three phasein period it proposed. Switzerland took particular issue with the transitional periods, saying that it believed China did not need them at all, sources .

       " 'U.S. Businesses Back Down From Targeting India As PFC Under Special 301 Inside U.S. Trade February 13, 2015 U.S. business associations have backed off from their demand last  that the Obama administration designate India as the most egregious violator of intellectual property rights (IPR) in their filings under the Special 301 provision of U.S. trade law, even though India applicable laws and policies have not fundamentally changed. U.S. business groups did not want to disrupt the newly warmed relations between the United States and India with such a demand,  Patrick Kilbride, the director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global IP Center. He added that the groups want to give India Prime Minister Narendra Modi enough space to make reforms. “I don\\'t think it any secret that criticism from U.S. industry at this particular junction could make it more difficult rather than less for the India government to take the steps we\\'d like to see,” he  in a Feb. 11 interview with Inside U.S. Trade. He emphasized that those laws and regulations need to be changed in the long term. Kilbride described the IP situation in India has having “stabilized” since the Modi administration came into office in May 2014, even though there have been no major changes in its laws and policies that U.S. businesses charge infringe on their IPR. Kilbride pointed to a number of shortterm actions that have been taken by the Modi government, like the dissolution of a cabinetlevel committee that was established specifically to consider applications for compulsory licenses. “There was a governmental bias in favor of issuing compulsory licenses. That committee has been disbanded,” Kilbride . “If nothing else, perception is extremely  to investor confidence.\" He added that the “imminent threat of compulsory licensing” was hindering IPdependent industries from operating in India. “That stuff alone carries a lot of significance,” Kilbride . Nevertheless, the Alliance for Fair Trade with India (AFTI) whose members include the Chamber, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) called on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct another outofcycle review (OCR) on India IPR policies. This would follow on one that took place last  and led to a work plan of bilateral technical meetings. “AFTI believes strongly that an OutofCycle Review in 2015 focused on substance and the steps that have been taken or that have not been taken to address existing problems is not only warranted, but necessary. Only in this way can USTR benchmark progress, if any, toward resolving longstanding U.S. concerns,” they wrote. Last , USTR rebuffed business demands to designate India a PFC under Special 301, which would have triggered an investigation of its IPR practices and potentially a repeal of U.S. unilateral trade benefits or a challenge in the World Trade Organization. Instead, USTR in its last Special 301 finding kept India on the priority watch list, the secondmost egregious designation in the Special 301 process. This is not a designation anchored in the statute, and therefore does not trigger a specific action. At the same time, USTR announced it would conduct an OCR of India IPR policies in light of the fact that a new government was scheduled to take power in May. That OCR led to a work plan involving a series of technical meetings between the U.S. and India governments to discuss IP issues, but does not lay out concrete timelines for any policy changes by India. AFTI and its member groups continued to voice alarm over the India government decision to issue a compulsory license for the cancer drug known as Nexavar. India patent law requires a patentee to \"work\" its product in India, and U.S. business groups have charged that India used this provision as a justification for issuing the compulsory license for Nexavar. No new compulsory licenses have been issued, but the members of AFTI called on the Modi government to renounce their use in the absence of a public health emergency. Another complaint reiterated in the business groups filings is that Section 3(d) of India Patents Act likely violates New Dehli obligations at the WTO. The WTO Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights stipulates that patents “shall be available for any inventions” if they are new, nonobvious and useful. U.S. industry has long asserted that this section of India law imposes a fourth requirement, that a new form or use of a drug is only an invention if it enhances the efficacy of the substance. The India Patent Office on Jan. 13 cited Section 3(d) when it rejected the patent application of Gilead for a key component in its drug Sovaldi, which is used to treat hepatitis C. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (RUT) raised this decision in a Jan. 27 hearing on the president trade policy agenda and pressed USTR Michael Froman on how he plans to take “meaningful action” against India. Froman replied that the U.S. has been engaging with the Modi administration since it came into office with the goal of addressing this issue. “We are committed to continuing to engage with them to underscore areas of work that needs to be done in copyright, in trade secrets as well as in the area of patents. I believe we\\'ve got a good dialogue going now with the new government on this issue, and we\\'re committed to working to achieve concrete progress in this area,” he . AFTI  the Solvadi issue “underscores the very real threat Section 3(d) still presents to patent protection” even though the India Patent Office decision was overturned in court. Kilbride  the U.S. business community does not have an expectation that engagement with India will result in “linear” progress, noting that their may be some setbacks in their efforts to engage with India to change its policies. Many U.S. business groups heralded the engagement between the U.S. and India since the inauguration of the Modi government in their filings to USTR. In other comments, the U.S.China Business Council highlighted the Chinese government policies requiring companies to turn over highly sensitive IP with the stated purpose of enhancing cybersecurity. The filing from BSA | The Software Alliance also briefly mentioned these policies. But beyond that, the public comments largely reiterated the same IPR issues they had previously filed, implying that the environmental has not changed much. For example, PhRMA reiterated its longstanding call for USTR to label Turkey as a PFC over its pharmaceutical IP regime, including what it charged is its ineffective mechanism for resolving patent infringement disputes. PhRMA also charged that Turkey does not have enough resources to register pharmaceutical products, and imposes government price controls on pharmaceutical products. Turkey was on USTR watch list in 2014. The International Intellectual Property Alliance did not list Ukraine as a PFC in its filing, even though Ukraine has not resolved any of the IP issues that led to it being designated as a PFC by USTR in 2013. It did not do so because of the ongoing crisis in the country and its conflict with Russia. “In light of recent political developments, the Government of Ukraine clearly has a limited capacity to effect certain legal reforms, and has its priorities elsewhere,” the filing . One source indicated that USTR is unlikely to sanction Ukraine over its IP violations while the crisis is ongoing. USTR declined to sanction Ukraine in March 2014 after it labeled the country a PFC, saying it would not be “appropriate” to do so at the time.',\n",
       " 'Congressional Trade, Judiciary Leaders Bash WIPO Process On GI Agreement World Trade Online Posted: February 13, 2015 The leaders of the congressional trade and judiciary committees have urged the head of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to permit the United States to vote on new provisions in the Lisbon Agreement an agreement to which the U.S. is not a party that would expand protections for geographical indications (GIs) among members. The U.S., in October 2014, failed in an attempt to secure a voice in the debate after most of the 28 signatories to the Lisbon Agreement rejected a proposal that would have allowed the U.S. and other nonparties to vote on whether new provisions should be adopted. It is now slated to be adopted at a conference taking place May 1121. In a Feb. 12 letter to Francis Gurry, director general of the Genevabased WIPO, the eight House and Senate members complained that the “views of all WIPO Members are not being adequately taken into account in the Lisbon Agreement revision process, even through the proposed changes will have substantial consequences for many of the countries that have been excluded, including the United States.” Signing the letter were Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (RUT) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (DOR), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (RIA) and Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (DVT), House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (RIA) and Ranking Member Sander Levin (DMI), and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte (RVA) and Ranking Member John Conyers Jr. (DMI). The Senate and House judiciary committees have jurisdiction over intellectual property law. The Lisbon Agreement currently protects 818 geographic names known as “appellations of origin,” restricting their use to certain producers from those regions, although appellations of origin are typically narrower than GIs. The agreement slated to be adopted in May would allow Lisbon signatories to also register GIs in the future. The letter warns that this will lead to an erosion of protections for food and beverage names the U.S. considers common or generic, such as “feta cheese,” around the world. “This is already occurring in many countries where U.S. companies face geographical indications registration that threaten to internationally block their use of common food names or negatively impact existing protections for their established trademarks,” it says. The letter also claims that not allowing nonsignatories to vote at the diplomatic conference is “contrary to the common WIPO protocol” over the past 25 . The last time nonsignatories were not allowed to vote was in 1989 during a diplomatic conference to conclude the Madrid Agreement on the international registration of trademarks, according one informed source. Whether Gurry would be able to intervene on the U.S. behalf is unclear. However, the informed source speculated the letter may not carry much weight with other WIPO members because U.S. congressional leaders typically do not have the same influence in international fora as they command in Washington. Israel was the only Lisbon Agreement signatory to align itself with the U.S. in the October meeting. Several other WIPO members who are not party to the Lisbon Agreement have also objected to their exclusion at the conference. They are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, New Zealand, Panama, South Korea, Singapore, and Uruguay. A Geneva source  that one of the intentions of the new provisions of the Lisbon Agreement is to attract new members, such as the European Union. Lisbon Agreement signatories will also be voting on a provision to allow economic blocs such as the EU to become parties to the agreement. Securing protections for GIs has been a key offensive interest for the EU in negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Seven EU members have signed onto the Lisbon Agreement. They are Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia.',\n",

The US president  over the weekend that European scrutiny of companies such as Google and Facebook was driven by the “commercial interests” of the region’s tech companies who struggle to compete with better American rivals. FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best stories from across the web “We have owned the internet. Our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it in ways that they can’t compete. And oftentimes what is portrayed as highminded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests,” Mr Obama  in an interview with technology news site Re/Code. European’s politicians and institutions reacted forcefully to the president’s remarks. “This point — that regulations are only there to shelter our companies — is out of line,”  a European Commission spokesperson. “Regulation should make it easier for nonEU companies to access the single market,” she went on. “It is in [US companies’] interest that things are enforced in a uniform manner.” In the past , Europe’s authorities have made a concerted effort to rein in the power and reach of leading US tech companies, often in response to concerns over US internet surveillance, tax avoidance and commercial dominance. Google, in particular, has been a target in the region, with an EU competition probe into the search company entering its fifth . Earlier this month, privacy watchdogs threatened legal action against Google over its implementation of the continent’s new “right to be forgotten” law. Last , the European parliament overwhelmingly backed a motion that called on regulators to consider the breakup of Google. Though the vote was merely symbolic, it was designed to put pressure on the European Commission to take a tougher line on the company. The vote led US Republican and Democratic politicians to send open letters expressing alarm over “proposals that seem to target US technology companies”. In defence of Google and Facebook, sometimes the European response here is more commercially driven than anything else Barack Obama “In defence of Google and Facebook, sometimes the European response here is more commercially driven than anything else,” Mr Obama . “As I’ve , there are some countries like Germany, given its history with the Stasi, that are very sensitive to these issues. But sometimes their vendors — their service providers who, you know, can’t compete with ours — are essentially trying to set up some roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there.” Google and Facebook declined to comment. Ramon Tremosa, a Catalan MEP who sponsored the parliament’s motion on Google, : “President Obama forgets or maybe isn’t aware that among the dozens of complainants in the Google antitrust case, there are several US companies. “Some companies, like Yelp, have no problem going public. Others don’t want to attack Google openly because they fear retaliation measures, such as demotion/exclusion and penalties supposedly applied by Google to some rival companies.” Other big US companies are struggling to navigate difficult terrain in Europe. Uber, the taxi app company, faces opposition from incumbent groups across the continent. Some countries and cities, particularly in France and Germany, are considering or enforcing bans on the San Franciscobased company operating in their locales. US tech groups are also under fire for their tax strategies, leading to investigations into their tax avoidance regimes. Last October, the Irish government  it would close a controversial tax loophole — known as “double Irish” — that had been exploited by the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple. Mr Obama’s defence of US tech companies came during a visit to Silicon Valley last week to show off joint government and corporate efforts to boost cyber security. However, relations between Silicon Valley and Washington have deteriorated in the wake of the Snowden revelations about US surveillance of the internet, with tech executives grumbling privately that the White House has not done enough to reinforce the privacy of their users. The top executives at Google, Facebook and Yahoo, which had been at the centre of the most damaging surveillance revelations, sent security officials to the event rather than attend in person, a decision that was seen as a snub for the president’s attempt to show a strong united front.',\n",

The import authorizations, some of which have been awaiting the commission’s approval for more than a , include products such as soybeans, corn, canola and cotton. “All of these products have received positive European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) scientific assessments and have been considered by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the Appeals Committee,” the groups wrote. “Timely action by the European Commission will avoid the risk of disruption to the essential supply of feedstocks needed by the EU’s livestock, poultry and feed industries, which are more than 70 percent dependent on imported protein.” The last import authorizations for new biotech crops were issued by the European Commission in November 2013. In the letter, the groups also urged the health and food safety commission to respect the European Union’s obligations under the World Trade Organization with regard to timelier biotech deregulation decisions, which were reaffirmed by the WTO in a 2006 dispute settlement decision that found that the European Union was not complying with its international obligations to consider import authorizations on a timely basis. The groups that signed the letter include the Agricultural Retailers Association, National Corn Growers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cotton Council, American Seed Trade Association, National Oilseed Processors Association, American Soybean Association, U.S. Canola Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, U.S. Grains Council, Corn Refiners Association, U.S. Soybean Export Council, and National Association of Wheat Growers.',\n",
       " 'Ignoring US demand, India to continue sops for textile exporters Amiti Sen 17 February 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) Says it has until2018 to withdraw the incentives In a major relief for textile exporters struggling to maintain their share in an uncertain global market, India has decided to continue with export sops for the sector in the new fiscal and, probably, the following two  as well. This is despite the US demanding that such incentives be done away with immediately. Washington argues that New Delhi no longer qualifies to give such concessions under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules as it attained export competitiveness in the textile sector eight  back. With India sticking to its stand, the Centre will not feel compelled to withdraw export incentives for the textile sector while announcing the Budget (for 201516) or the Foreign Trade Policy. While not willing to withdraw the sops right away, the Commerce and Textile Ministries have, however, started working on alternative schemes that are WTO compliant, so that export sops for the sector can be replaced over the next three . Phaseout period “The US has been claiming that we need to stop our export sops for the textiles sector from 2015, but we believe that our phaseout period ends in 2018. We will stick to our deadline,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine . The sops that will have to be phased out include the popular Focus Product and Focus Market schemes under which exports to targeted markets are incentivised, the EPCG scheme and the interest subvention scheme for export credit. As per WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, export subsidies can be given only by countries that have not attained export competitiveness, which is defined as attaining a 3.25 per cent share in world trade for a product for two consecutive . Members get eight  to phase out their export subsidies once they reach export competitiveness. New Delhi’s argument is that since the WTO undertook a computation of India’s world trade share following a member’s request only in 2011, and determined that it had retained competitiveness on the basis of data of 200910, it can be inferred that the phaseout period would end in 2018. As per statistics compiled by the WTO, India’s share in world trade for textile and clothing was 4.66 per cent in 2013 with exports worth $37 billion. Textile and clothing exports contribute more than 10 per cent to India’s export basket.',\n",

The Finance Ministry imposed the import duty on a type of graphite electrodes based on recommendations of the Directorate General of AntiDumping Duty (DGAD) for five . The duty ranges between USD 278.19 and USD 922.03. The main use of graphite electrodes is in melting of steel. The DGAD had initiated and conducted investigation into dumping, injury and causal links between dumping and injury to the domestic industry. In its final findings, the DGAD  it \"is of the opinion that definitive measure is required to be imposed to offset dumping and injury being caused to the domestic industry\" and recommended the imposition of the antidumping duty.

       " 'Vietnam: Antidumping protectionism A double edged sword 17 February 2015 Thai News Service Section: General News Despite World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments made by countries around the globe to liberalize trade and fight against protectionism, the tendency to impose traderestricting measures and harm exports of other countries has been on the upswing. Against the backdrop of a world economy in recovery, protectionism is particularly  because it runs contradictory to international integration and fuels continuing economic uncertainty. It also damages value chains. During the past 20  there have been a total of 80 tradeunfriendly measures, principally antidumping lawsuits, lodged against Vietnam according to the Competitiveness Management Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The number of measures filed affecting Vietnamese exports has been trending upwards, with the US accounting for the highest number, 20%. The European Union (EU) made up 15% of the total cases and India and Turkey, 11%. The number of incidences for which countries have imposed new export restrictions has also been on the uptick, a trend seen as worrisome for the detrimental consequences such practices can have for both the global commodity markets and value chains. Typical methods of protectionism are import tariffs, quotas, subsidies or tax cuts to local businesses, new import licensing procedures, reference values, minimum transaction prices or banning trade altogether. These measures have most seriously impacted the Vietnamese seafood, garment and textile and footwear exporters, causing them to lose markets. Notably, however, protectionism measures have not been that well understood nor utilized by Vietnam. As of September, Vietnam had conducted merely three antidumping investigations on imported goods. The only measure that was successful resulted in Vietnam imposing an antidumping duty on coldrolled stainless steel from China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan (China) from October 5, 2014 forward. Vietnamese exporters should increase links amongst themselves and seek information on international legal regulations to reduce losses to the manufacturing sector by unfair trade practices,  Nguyen Huu Truong Hung at the Competitiveness Management Department. Trade protection measures are a valid tool the WTO allows its member countries to use legally if member countries fail to strictly comply with agreements of the WTO on antidumping, antisubsidy and selfdefence capital. Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Do Thang Hai in turn noted many countries have used antidumping lawsuits quite effectively as tools to fight against unfair competitiveness of foreign importers. If found guilty of unfair trade practices a foreign company would be prohibited from exporting to the Vietnam market for a period of five , which could be extended if investigations show the practices were continuing. Antidumping lawsuits and other measures should not be viewed as protectionism measures, but rather as trade policy tools to protect fair and balance trade, Hai underscored. VOV',\n",

       " 'Greece bailout talks collapse in acrimony Peter Spiegel in Brussels Financial Times Last updated: February 17, 2015 8:16 am A crucial meeting of eurozone finance ministers over the future of Greece’s bailout broke down in acrimony after Athens angrily rejected the bloc’s insistence that it agree to complete its current €172bn rescue as “absurd” and “unacceptable”. It is the second time in five days that negotiations between the new antiausterity Greek government and its eurozone creditors have collapsed and it means Athens, whose public finances are deteriorating fast, could soon be left with no European financial backstop. The eurozone gave Athens until Wednesday night to reverse course and seek an extension of the current programme, which is due to expire at the end of next week. Market reaction to the breakdown of the meeting was cautious in early trading on Tuesday. After initial seesaws, the euro was largely flat against tthe dollar at $1.136. The Greek 10 yield jumped 15 basis points to 9.46 per cent, while the three yield has climbed 65 bp to 17.91 per cent. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the eurogroup of finance ministers,  on Monday the time available for a Greek request was almost up: “We can use this week, but that’s about it,” he . “There was a very strong opinion across the whole eurogroup that the next step has to come from the Greek authorities.” Monday’s talks collapsed when Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, strongly objected to a draft statement requiring Athens to prolong the bailout and implement the economic reform requirements that are included in the programme. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Varoufakis for the first time  publicly he had been prepared to agree an extension of the existing programme, but under different conditions than the eurogroup ultimately demanded. He  an earlier plan presented to him by Pierre Moscovici, the European Commission’s economic chief, for a fourmonth prolongation was in line with Greek thinking and he had been ready to sign it before it was changed. “I have no doubt there is going to be an agreement in the end,” he added. Eurozone officials had viewed Monday’s meeting as a makeorbreak session, with time running out for any bailout extension to be approved in national parliaments. Although officials  they could still get an extension approved if a request comes before the end of the week, Monday’s impasse suggests further talks may be futile. Without an EU backstop in place, eurozone officials are concerned market turmoil could begin anew and are particularly worried that it could spark a bank run in Greece. Athens has insisted that it has enough funding to keep the government running for several months but some eurozone officials believe it could run short of cash next month. The draft statement that precipitated the collapse of the talks, obtained by the Financial Times,  that Greece would agree to a sixmonth “technical extension” giving time for “work on a followup arrangement”. “The Greek authorities gave their firm commitment to refrain from unilateral action and will work in close agreement with its European and international partners, especially in the field of tax policy, privatisation, labour market reforms, financial sector and pensions,” it added. EU officials  Mr Moscovici’s plan was presented after a midday phone call between his boss, European Commission president JeanClaude Juncker, and Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister. According to an official briefed on the talks, the two men agreed to an outline that included several commitments from Athens during the extension period: Greece would pay all its creditors, not to roll back any of the economic reforms, maintain a budget surplus, and abide by a debt relief agreement reached in November 2012. In exchange, the eurozone would refrain from forcing Athens to adopt measures it believed would damage the economy and the Greece’s three international creditors — the commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank — would begin work on a “new deal for Greece”, essentially a third bailout. Eurozone officials  they did not believe Mr Juncker’s proposal was substantively different to the communiqué rejected by Mr Varoufakis, but EU officials acknowledged that the later statement did not contain many of the elements Mr Tsipras had negotiated with Mr Juncker. Mr Dijsselbloem  the eurogroup was prepared to meet again on Friday but only if Athens specifically requested an extension and committed to completing the terms of the current bailout. “There should also be a commitment from the Greek authorities to successfully conclude the programme,” Mr Dijsselbloem . “We should have assurance that is the intention.” That insistence appeared to be where the talks broke down, and could be a rift that is impossible to bridge. Mr Varoufakis  Athens would continue to refuse to implement the existing bailout: “We do not believe it is a programme that can be successfully completed.” Both he and Mr Dijsselbloem  they remain hopeful that an agreement could be reached before the end of the week. But, the recriminations appeared to further fray already wellworn nerves on both sides. Mr Varoufakis vowed not to give in to the eurogroup’s “ultimatum”, and earlier in the day, Wolfgang Schäuble, German finance minister accused Athens of “behaving rather irresponsibly”.

       " \"U.S. Restates Case for COOL Rules at WTO Appellate Hearing By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 18, 2015 Feb. 17 — The U.S., during two lengthy Appellate Body hearings Feb. 16 and 17, sought to overturn a 2014 World Trade Organization decision that its Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) requirements violated international standards. U.S. trade officials  its amended COOL regulations—which require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered—do not unfairly discriminate against or burden other export countries and serve a legitimate purpose by helping consumers understand where their meat comes from. Mexico and Canada  the U.S. COOL rules have harmed their pork and beef industries by imposing undue burdens and costs exceeding $1 billion per . “COOL does not provide any information useful for health, safety, quality or any other benefits,” Mexico told the Appellate Body. Canada claimed the regulations amounted to a “de facto closing of the border to foreign origin livestock.” Retaliatory Tariffs Loom The U.S. has lost one WTO appeal of its COOL rules and was forced to amend the regulations in 2013. Last , a WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) panel determined the amended rules imposed a greater “detrimental impact” on competition for Mexican and Canadian livestock than the original rules. The U.S. hopes to prevent Mexico and Canada from seeking billions of dollars in retaliatory trade measures if the WTO again finds the U.S. rules to be in noncompliance with international standards. Canadian officials have  they will target nearly 40 U.S. products—such as beef, pork, poultry, cherries, chocolate and frozen orange juice—if the U.S. fails to comply with the decision. Canada Minister of Agriculture and AgriFood, Gerry Ritz, recently  Canada is a primary export market for 35 U.S. states, which have reported $2 billion in beef and pork sales to Canada (25 WTO, 2/6/15). Ritz  any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products would have a big impact on states like California, with $600 million in trade, and Texas, with $300 million in trade. TBT Article 2.1 The U.S. argued that its revised labeling rules are consistent with Article 2.1 of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement because they provide a “legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis” for its importing partners to keep records of where livestock is born, raised and slaughtered. WTO compliance panels previously ruled that the amended COOL rules entailed an “increased record keeping burden,” had “a potential for label inaccuracy” and continued to “exempt a large proportion of muscle cuts.” The U.S. contested each point and  the panels failed to conduct the proper analysis, relied on “fictional hypotheticals,” and contradicted their own findings. Canada  the WTO compliance panels conducted a “thorough analysis” in their findings that the COOL measures may lead to label inaccuracies and record keeping burdens. Canada also noted, with respect to label inaccuracies, that 84 percent of the beef and pork consumed in the U.S. are not subject to point of production labeling. The U.S. has “failed to present any ‘cogent reasons' that warrant a departure from the analysis that the Appellate Body applied in the original proceedings,” Canada . Since the U.S. livestock industry is subject to less restrictive standards than other importers, the “primary beneficiaries of the measures are not U.S. consumers but, rather, U.S. cattle producers,” Mexican trade officials  at the hearing. TBT Article 2.2 Canada and Mexico contested the earlier panels' decision that they had failed to make a prima facie case that the amended rules were more traderestrictive than necessary under the Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement. Mexico called the rules “a classic example of a discriminatory measure and an unnecessary obstacle to international trade.” Canada  the measures provided a “very heavy evidentiary burden” on its imports. “Canada considers that Article 2.2 prohibits members from applying technical regulations having a level of trade restrictiveness that is out of all proportion to the risks nonfulfillment would create.” The U.S. urged the Appellate Panel to reverse the earlier panels' interpretation of the phrase “taking account of the risks nonfulfillment would create” with respect to being less traderestrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. Canada objected to the U.S. request, saying its interpretation “finds no support in the text, context, object and purpose of the TBT Agreement, or previous findings of the Appellate Body.” GATT Article III:4 The U.S. argued that the earlier panels erred in finding that the amended COOL measure was inconsistent with Article III:4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 because their analysis was “contrary to customary rules of interpretation of public international law.” The U.S.  the panels failed to accurately interpret Article IX of the GATT 1994, which outlines general rules regarding marks of origin, in their determination regarding unreasonable increases to the cost of imported products. The U.S.  the panels further erred in ignoring Article XX of the GATT 1994, which outlines general exceptions to the agreement, in its determination that the amended COOL measures violated Article III:4. Canada  GATT Article IX was not relevant to the proceedings and warned the Appellate Body not to entertain the U.S.’s “ambiguous defensive claim under GATT Article XX,” which Canada  is unrelated to the previous panel reports. “Since the United States did not invoke, let alone establish, a defense under Article XX of the GATT 1994, the panel correctly found that the measure violates Article III:4,” Mexico . Report Timeline Pending The Appellate Body previously determined it would not be able to circulate its reports in the appeal within a 90day timeframe and it remains unclear when the final reports will be issued. Although the U.S. notified the DSB on Nov. 28 that it would appeal the earlier panel decision, participants requested an extension of the DSB requirement to issue an appellate report within 90 days of the initial notification. Participants cited “serious resource constraints due to concurrent work on other pending proceedings, as well as the constraints imposed by the contemporaneous holiday period, the multiple complex issues at stake in these disputes, and the present workload of the Appellate Body” in their request to extend the timeline. The Appellate Body  it would notify participants of the circulation date of its reports “shortly after” the oral hearing. The case is being reviewed by a threemember appellate panel that includes: Peter Van den Bossche of Belgium, Ricardo RamirezHernandez of Mexico, and Seung Wha Chang of Korea.\",\n",
       " 'Japan Tobacco threatens legal action against Ireland over cigarette packaging By Conor Humphries DUBLIN Tue Feb 17, 2015 9:48am EST (Reuters) — Ireland is to proceed with plans for a law requiring tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in plain packets, legislation that has prompted a threat of legal action from Japan Tobacco International. Ireland  in 2013 it wanted to become the first country in the European Union to ban branding on cigarette packages. Australia introduced a ban a few  ago as a way to reduce smoking and is facing challenges at the World Trade Organisation over complaints the laws create illegal obstacles to commerce. Japan Tobacco, whose cigarette brands include Camel and Winston, has now threatened legal action against Ireland’s plans. “We have informed the government that we stand ready to file legal proceedings should it continue pushing for a ‘cut and paste’ policy that has failed in Australia,” Japan Tobacco International Ireland general manager Igor Dzaja  in an emailed statement. “Plain packaging puts politics before evidence,” he . The company  the move would cast doubt on Ireland’s reputation for protecting intellectual property rights and would undermine its ability to attract foreign direct investment. The minister who designed the legislation, James Reilly,  the government would proceed. He  tobacco branding was not something that anyone who had any regard for public health could possibly fail to address. “The government have been advised by the Attorney General that there is no reason to delay the bill,” Reilly, the minister for children and former minister for health  in an interview with RTE radio. He  the legislation would be ready within weeks. The Irish parliament’s health committee is due to debate the legislation on Tuesday. The British government has  it plans to introduce a similar law before May.',\n",

During a meeting in Istanbul on February 9, 2015, the Business20 (B20) trade task force, comprising 68 company executives from 25 countries, urged the G20 leaders to implement all elements of the WTO ministerial decisions adopted at the Bali Ministerial Conference on December 7, 2013. \"The world leading corporations are deeply invested in helping to shape a trade agenda that will deliver economic growth and millions of new jobs,\"  Güler Guler Sabanci, Chairman of Turkey Sabanci Holdings, who cochaired the task force meeting with International Chamber of Commerce Chairman Harold McGraw. \"Trade is key to meeting the G20 growth targets over the next five , and the G20 plays a critical role in driving the negotiations forward,\" she . \"G20 Leaders in Brisbane pledged to implement all elements of the Bali package and to swiftly define a WTO work program on the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda, [towards a global free trade agreement],\"  McGraw. \"The time is now for government leaders to deliver progress on the trade agenda, and business stands ready to ensure that these pledges are fulfilled,\" he . The TFA will create binding commitments across all WTO members to expedite the movement, release, and clearance of goods, improve cooperation among WTO members in customs matters, and help developing countries fully implement the Agreement terms. It is estimated that the agreement can cut trade costs by almost 14.5 percent for lowincome countries, and by 10 percent for highincome countries, forming part of international efforts to cut tax barriers to trade on a global basis under the Doha Round.',\n",

NEW YORK — With domestic demand falling, U.S. steel imports have reached alarming heights in early 2015, and steelmakers are weighing several trade remedy measures to protect their markets, according to the Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA). \"We are approaching a crisis situation,\" SMA president Philip K. Bell told AMM Feb. 9. \"You have less demand, but more imports. .\\u2005.\\u2005. This is particularly the case for the OCTG (oil country tubular goods) market, with oil prices half of what they were last  and demand significantly down.\" Bell  that current market conditions \"are some of the worst we\\'ve seen in 15 .\" Steel imports in 2014 touched historic levels in terms of market penetration (amm.com, Jan. 20 [http://www.amm.com/Article/3419103/ImportpenetrationatrecordlevelAISI.html]) and in volumes handled at major steel ports such as Houston (amm.com, Jan. 29 [http://www.amm.com/Article/3422668/Houstonportssteelvolumesetsrecord.html]). U.S. imports of OCTG last month were the highest in five  despite weak domestic demand, according to Bell. He  that the surge could have been driven by a World Trade Organization (WTO) appeal by South Korean exporters in December seeking to overturn antidumping duties imposed in July (amm.com, Dec. 22 [http://www.amm.com/Article/3412674/SKoreaseeksWTOtalksonOCTGduties.html]). U.S. imports of OCTG were slated to total 478,905 tonnes in January, including 215,342 tonnes from Korea, according to license data updated Feb. 10 by the Commerce Department Enforcement and Compliance division. Monthly OCTG imports from Korea—the largest OCTG exporter to the United States—never exceeded 200,000 tonnes in 2014, averaging 120,028 tonnes per month, data show. The January U.S. license data is preliminary, with final Census Bureau import data due in coming weeks. A \"tsunami of imports\" coupled with weaker demand requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from U.S. steel producers, labor groups and the federal government, Bell . The U.S. steel industry is mulling a number of trade cases on a broad range of flat and long products, including rebar, wire rod, beams, merchant bar and coldrolled sheet, according to a Jan. 29 presentation to SMA board members by Alan H. Price, a partner at Washingtonbased law firm Wiley Rein LLP. Socalled Section 201 safeguard cases also are an option for U.S. steelmakers, according to the presentation, although such safeguards have not been seen in the U.S. steel sector for more than a decade. However, Section 201 cases typically take two to three  to litigate and carry a higher burden of proof for showing injury to the domestic industry. Relief for domestic steelmakers also lasts only for two to three , even though a Section 201 case is a \"potential option\" to address some imports of flatrolled steel, wire rod and rebar, according to the presentation. China WTO status as a nonmarket economy also could expire in 2016, which is another concern on the horizon for the SMA, which represents electricarc furnace (EF) steelmakers. China nonmarket economy status in trade disputes allows the United States and other countries to pursue tougher trade protection, such as significantly higher antidumping and countervailing margins. \"If it (China) graduates to a market economy status in 2016, a lot of those (trade) remedies go away, and it makes a bad situation even worse,\" Bell .',\n",
       " 'U.S. cracks open door for some Cuban imports By Doug Palmer | 2/13/15 6:03 PM EST POLITICO The State Department opened the door for Cuba’s small privatesector business community to export goods and services to the United States but excluded rum, cigars, food, machinery and a broad swath of other products from the historic change. “This is more good news on Cuba policy,”  Jake Colvin, vice president for global trade issues at the National Foreign Trade Council, a U.S. business group that has pushed for normalized relations with the communistrun island. “In theory, Cubans can now export everything from artwork to graphic design services.” The list of approved imports excludes many broad categories, such as food and agricultural products, alcohol, tobacco, minerals, vehicles and other modes of transportation, arms and ammunition, and some chemicals and textiles. But that still leaves many other items that could be exported to the United States, including shoes, hats, umbrellas, carpets, some clothing items, perfume, soap, candles, jewelry, musical instruments, toys, artwork and furniture. The action stems from President Barack Obama’s decision in December to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease some elements of the fivedecadeold economic embargo. Last month, the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments published new rules making it easier to travel to the island and for U.S. companies to export some goods. The rules announced on Friday deal with the other side of the equation: allowing Cuban entrepreneurs operating outside the control of the government to sell their goods to customers in the United States. “I think it’s historic because its creating the architecture by which Americans can now look at Cuba and see what the business opportunities are,”  Augusto Maxwell, a lawyer who heads Akerman LLP’s Cuba practice in Miami. “American capitalists can now go there and decide whether it makes economic sense to import things.” In its announcement, the State Department indicated the list of approved goods could grow over time. Also, there are no restrictions on imports of services, creating a potential new business opportunity for Cuba’s welleducated population, which includes many underemployed doctors, architects and engineers. “This points to a possibility where Americans can tap into Cuba’s human capital on the service side,” Maxwell . “So it will be interesting to see what the Cuban government allows.” The U.S. business community is closely watching how Cuban President Raúl Castro and his brother Fidel respond. “It’s an open question as to how many Cubans will be able to access the U.S. marketplace, and that depends in part on decision making in Cuba,” Colvin . Cuban entrepreneurs or businesses that want to export to the United States must provide their customers some documentary evidence that they are not controlled or owned by the Cuban government, such as a copy of license to be selfemployed or the equivalent for a company. A number of lawmakers have followed up on Obama’s initial move in December by offering legislation to completely lift the longtime economic embargo. But that still faces stiff opposition from CubanAmerican members of Congress.',\n",
       " 'Delta Airlines boss blames Arabian Peninsula 9/11 terrorists for bankruptcy Courtney Trenwith 17 February 2015 ArabianBusiness.com A major American airline CEO embroiled in a heated dispute against three Gulf airlines has blamed 9/11 terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula” for his company’s bankruptcy bailout in 2005.Delta Airlines’ Richard Anderson is one of three US carriers that claim they have evidence Dubai UAEbased Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have received a total of more than $40 billion in government subsidies that breach the Gulf states’ open skies agreements with the US. Denying the cash hand outs, Emirates CEO Tim Clark  Delta and United Airlines’ had benefited from US bankruptcy laws that allowed them to forgo debt and cut operating costs to continue flying in what amounted to arguably the biggest subsidy of all”. Speaking on CNN on Monday, Anderson inferred the Gulf states were responsible for those bankruptcies. It’s a great irony to have the UAE from the Arabian Peninsula talk about that given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/11, which came from terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula, which caused us to go through a massive restructuring,” he . Numerous airlines globally were forced to undertake unprecedented restructuring programs in the mid2000s, including retrenching thousands of staff and cutting services when flight bookings plummeted following the New York City attacks in 2001.Two of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE, while 15 were from Saudi Arabia and the others were from Egypt and Lebanon. Anderson  although the restructured airlines had been allowed to forgo billions of dollars in debt, it was categorically false” that they had received bailouts.And in the US our restructuring process is transparent and there is no government subsidy, and in fact there were billions of dollars of equity and unsecured debt that were wiped out through that process,” he .Anderson claimed Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways were not airlines, they are governments”. Delta, United and American Airlines have collaborated to call on the US government to review the open skies agreement with the Gulf airlines.[We want] our government to go in and request negotiations and negotiate a way to level the playing field to set off against $40 billion in subsides, most of which is just direct subsidies,” Anderson . We have spent two  analysing their financials and we have found evidence of their actual financial statements from other places in the world that provide documented evidence that can’t be refuted of tens of billions of dollars of direct government subsidies. The Middle East carriers, the UAE and Qatar cannot deny huge government subsidies. They’re a violation of the WTO [World Trade Organization] definition of subsidy and they’re a violation of US open skies agreements. So let’s not be detracted by the huffing arguments that the UAE make.”In a rare public rebuke of criticism of Emirates, Clark  in a statement last week that the complaining airlines’ call for political protection makes absolutely no sense” and made a mockery of the country’s liberalist stance. As far as the airline industry is concerned, aeropolitical protection for airlines is arguably the biggest subsidy of all,” Clark  in a statement sent to Arabian Business. Therefore, it would be ironic, and a shame, if the US, who have been the forerunners of liberalisation and deregulation, would now contemplate a Uturn on its successful international aviation policies for the benefit of a narrow few, based on sweeping and unfounded subsidy allegations. ”The Gulf carriers have rapidly expanded globally but service a maximum of nine US cities and Clark  there was virtually no” overlap with flights offered by the complaining US airlines.Those services also allowed passengers onestop connectivity to 60 other cities in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific destinations he  were not currently served by American carriers, except perhaps via their alliance partners where routings are often relatively convoluted or inconvenient”, Clark  .Meanwhile the Gulf carriers provided billions of dollars annually to the US economy by providing consumer and business connections.',\n",
       " 'USTR report touts ‘unprecedented’ labor efforts back By Matthew Korade | 2/13/15 5:45 PM EST POLITICO The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in a new report, is touting its efforts to create the strongest labor protections in history, affecting as many as 650 million workers around the globe in a pair of AsiaPacific and European Union trade deals it’s negotiating. But labor groups aren’t expressing much confidence in the claim. The USTR’s pushing for commitments in the 12country TransPacific Partnership that would discourage forced labor, adopt laws on acceptable working conditions, including minimum wages, maximum hours and occupational health and safety, and not weaken labor protections in export processing zones, the report says. In the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the agency is seeking to maintain each side’s high labor standards while strengthening their ability to address labor concerns in developing countries with which they trade, says the report, which highlights the agency’s labor efforts in Guatemala, Bahrain, Colombia, Jordan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Swaziland and Haiti. In a joint blog post, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman called the combined effort “unprecedented.” “The benefits of trade for the global economy are vast, but it takes strong leadership and sustained effort to ensure that these benefits are broadly shared and support a growing and vibrant middle class around the world and here at home,” they . “As a starting point, these agreements [TPP and TTIP] must include the groundbreaking provisions from the ‘May 10, 2007’ bipartisan CongressionalExecutive Agreement, including that countries ‘adopt and maintain’ in their laws and practices the fundamental labor rights as stated in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work,” the blog added. Those standards require the countries to uphold the right to organize, bargain collectively and be free from forced labor, child labor and discrimination in employment, or face possible litigation under the dispute settlement processes outlined in the trade agreements. Labor groups have been highly critical of past trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, for not including labor provisions within the pacts or, as in the case of the free trade deal with Jordan, not making them strong and enforceable. “In short, we have a fundamental difference of opinion with the administration on the effectiveness of the U.S. labor provisions in trade agreements,”  Celeste Drake, a trade and globalization policy specialist at AFLCIO. “Yes, they have gotten better over time, but from such a low starting point that ‘better’ is hardly a useful measure.\" Drake pointed to U.S. litigation against Guatemala and steps to accelerate labor protections in Colombia as just two examples of Washington’s footdragging and ineffectual efforts to ensure protections in countries where reforms are needed. While the Guatemala case, which the labor group petitioned for, was indeed the first time the United States pursued a labor dispute through a trade agreement, as the USTR touted, the more than six wait for that to happen was far too long, Drake . “During that time, even more workers were fired, threatened, and subject to violence — nothing has meaningfully improved for workers there in the sixplus  since the case was filed,” Drake  in an email. “[S]o it is hard to argue that ‘the system is working’ if by ‘working’ one means that workers have a ‘decent living, safe and healthy workplaces where workers’ rights are respected, and a fair share in growing prosperity.\" Similarly, an action plan that the U.S. and Colombia agreed to in April 2011 to force the South American country’s compliance with labor standards under their bilateral trade deal also has failed, Drake . Workers there “tell us that in many sectors labor repression has actually increased since the ‘Action Plan’ went into effect — and I would recommend reviewing the labor action plan, which in fact contained no requirements that Colombia establish a meaningful record of enforcement of the plan prior to the ratification or implementation of this agreement,” she . “U.S. workers and our counterparts in trading partner nations are living under a regime of stagnating wages, growing inequality, and diminishing rights driven by competition between firms seeking to maximize profits at our expense instead of in cooperation with workers,” Drake . “There is a better way in which we can all prosper together. But the USTR has not yet adopted that model.” USTR acknowledged in its report that Guatemala must do more to ensure labor protections, including enacting legislation to expedite the sanctioning of employers that violate labor laws and issuing and publicizing standardized time frames for labor inspections. But the agency touted “ steps” that the country has taken to implement a labor enforcement plan, including the hiring of 100 new inspectors, the issuance of legal instruments to ensure police assistance for those inspectors on worksites, and the review of labor courts in an effort to hold judges who fail to take measures to enforce court orders accountable. Colombia, too, has taken several enforcement steps, including increasing the budget of its National Protection Unit — which protects citizens against targeted violence — by more than 30 percent and that of its Independent Prosecutor General’s Office, USTR . It has also hired more labor inspectors and enacted legislation to strengthen its criminal code, among other things. The USTR is currently seeking public comment on the Guatemala labor dispute.',\n",

Speaking in Nairobi during a meeting with officials of the East Africa Confederation of Informal Sector Organisation (EACISO) in Nairobi, Kenyatta  local products will convert the EAC region from a consumer of imports to producer of locally available products. The president  it is not acceptable for the region to continue exporting raw materials only to import the same as finished products at higher prices. \"The government recognized the role of the informal sector in youth employment and is supporting artisans through soft loans to make quality products that meet global standards to remain competitive in the market,\" Kenyatta  in a statement issued after the meeting. CISO is the apex EA regional body representing the informal economic sector and draws representation from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. \"The programmes in place include 30 percent of all government tenders to empower youth, women and the disabled to manufacture quality products and create employment,\" he added. He  his government has also put in place programmes to empower youth and other vulnerable groups to raise their standards of living. The Kenyan leader lauded the EACISO for bringing together artisans and other microsmall and medium enterprises operators, saying the move promoted EA integration. He observed that the informal sector is a source of livelihood to a large population and utilizes raw materials available in the region, assuring CISO of his support in the formulation of a standard training and certification for artisans at the regional level which, he , would boost the recognition of their products in the market. CISO representatives, in a memorandum, recommended the establishment of onestop shops where residents in member countries can showcase and sell their products. \"Ordinary citizens are already trading in onestop shops especially at Malaba, Namanga among other border points and ours is to just formalize,\" he . CISO representatives also recommended establishment of MSEs in all EAC member states, similar to the MSE Authority of Kenya which is already in place, to provide trade linkages. They also rooted for introduction of a policy to promote the informal sector by ensuring that each partner state promotes \"Buy East Africa\" to \"Build East Africa\" by procuring 40 percent of goods and service from the MSEs.',\n",

Ten percent of the world people are directly affected by this money, Pedro De Vasconcelos, programme coordinator for remittances with the International Fund for Agricultural Development, told a conference on Tuesday. \"Migrants are investing back into poor regions,\" Vasconcelos , adding that about $200 billion is expected to go directly to rural areas. This money could play a key role in boosting food production and eliminating the hunger faced by 805 million people by allowing families to invest in land, seeds, livestock and equipment. The United Nations estimates that is the number of people one ninth of the global population who have too little to eat. An estimated 80 percent of the rural people receiving remittances do not have access to traditional banking services, Vasconcelos . Harnessing mobile technology and other new approaches to banking could help link rural residents to financial systems when they collect their remittances, giving them better access to savings, insurance and other financial products which could help them improve farm productivity, he . The projection of $500 billion in remittances going to poor countries in 2015 is a significant jump from the $404 billion in such remittances the World Bank recorded in 2013.

Chief minister Anandiben Patel made an announcement in this regard during her address at the foundation stone laying ceremony of SDB on Sunday. The university is likely to come up on 100 acres of land and will act as catalyst for growth of the textile industry in the city. India’s nearest competitors Pakistan has a textile university since 1959 while Bangladesh got one in 2010. According to sources, India’s share in the global textile market is about 3 per cent. Sources  that a bill in this regard will be passed in the state assembly and after the formal procedure is complete the project would be announced by the state government. “If we want to increase our market share rapidly and compete with others, we need a university that will establish multidisciplinary institutional mechanism for formulation of policy measures and specific action plans, including those relating to World Trade Organization (WTO),”  a top official from Surat collector’s office. “We need such institution to review and revitalize the working of Textile Research Associations (TRAs),” he added. “If such a university comes up in Surat, it will help the city’s textile industry to transform itself,”  Kamal Tulsiyan, president, Pandesara Industrial Association and a dying mill owner.

A source close to the government  Greece intends to ask on Wednesday for an extension for up to six months of a loan agreement with the euro zone, on conditions to be negotiated. The source drew a distinction between a loan agreement and the full bailout programme which the government insists is dead. However hardline German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble dismissed the Greek gambit, telling broadcaster ZDF: \"It not about extending a credit programme but about whether this bailout programme will be fulfilled, yes or no.\" Financial markets held their nerve after the latest talks among euro zone finance ministers broke down late on Monday and EU partners gave Greece until the end of the week to request an extension or lose financial assistance. Many investors believe that whatever the rhetoric, both sides will find a facesaving formula before Athens\\' credit lines expire in 10 days. If they fail, Greece could rapidly run out of cash and need its own currency. Greek banking sources  outflows of deposits increased on Tuesday after the failure of Monday talks, but were not as severe as on some days last month around the election of a radical antiausterity government. The European Central Bank will review emergency funding for Greek banks on Wednesday but should not cut the lifeline this week, a source familiar with the situation . Both sides continue to insist Greece will remain in the euro. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers in his Syriza party that the government elected to scrap the bailout, repeal hated austerity measures and end cooperation with the \"troika\" of EU, ECB and IMF lenders would not compromise. Greece would no longer be treated like a colony of a pariah in Europe, Tsipras . He accused Schaeuble of losing his cool and making degrading comments about Greece and  \"certain circles\" in the euro zone were out to undermine his government. Schaeuble, 72, hammered home a takeitorleaveit message, wondering sarcastically whether Tsipras and his \"famous economist\" of a finance minister knew what they wanted or were making the right choices for the Greek people. \"The question still remains if Greece wants a programme at all or not,\" he told reporters in Brussels after another day of meetings in Brussels. \"On Feb. 28, at midnight, it over.\" Seasoned Eurocrats  Tsipras and his team seemed unprepared, unrealistic and oblivious to the dangers they are courting by refusing to roll over a 240billioneuro credit deal and demanding easier terms. Tsipras, 40,  he was in no rush and would not give in to \"blackmail\" from technocrats a new hint that he hoped hitherto unresponsive EU leaders would step in and clinch a political agreement with him, which they declined to do last week. Two of his EU peers who may be trying to broker a compromise Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi telephoned the Greek leader on Tuesday, their offices  without giving details. EU officials were unsure whether his fierce rhetoric was aimed at bolstering domestic support to avert a backlash against eventual compromise, or signalled he was retreating from a deal. GLIMMERS OF COMPROMISE Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis an academic economist dismissed suggestions his only option was to ask for the bailout to be extended. He  he had been ready to sign a text floated by EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici that Greek officials  called for the \"loan agreement\" to be extended as part of a \"transition\" to a new deal. The Greek plan to request an extended \"loan agreement\" may be an attempt to revive the Moscovici formula shunned by euro zone ministers. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin suggested Greece could win leeway to run a smaller budget surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP and  clinching a deal was largely a matter of finding the right words. It was not clear whether Sapin compromise ideas had any backing from Germany or other euro zone hardliners. Tsipras raised the stakes by vowing to legislate fast to scrap labour market deregulation brought in by his conservative predecessor to meet international creditors\\' demands for less protection for workers\\' rights. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup of 19 countries using the common currency, stuck to his guns, saying Athens must seek an extension: \"It really up to the Greeks. We cannot make them or ask them. We stand ready to work with them, also (over) the next couple of days.\" Schaeuble and others emphasised the unanimity Greek faced across the table, with some ministers from eastern Europe noting that a minimum wage Tsipras plans to raise is as high as average salaries in some countries where taxpayers funded the bailout. \"TROUBLESOME\" Some other ministers  the new Greek government did not seem to grasp the gravity of the situation or put forward coherent proposals in writing. \"It is troublesome that Greece has twice explained its goals orally, but no written presentation has been given yet,\"  Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, one of the euro zone hawks. Time is running short and investors marked down Greek stocks and bonds after Monday debacle, some saying the risk of Greece exiting the euro had risen. Three government bond yields rose more than a point to 19 percent, highlighting how far Athens remains unable to fund itself at manageable interest rates on the markets. Dijsselbloem has  Friday is a deadline for a deal that would allow time for some national parliaments to ratify it. A failure of the debt talks could lead to the imposition of capital controls, limiting money withdrawals and transfers, as happened in Cyprus in 2013. Investment bank Barclays  the breakdown of talks had raised the risk that Greece would leave the euro zone and raised the prospect that Tsipras would have to call a referendum on whether to accept a deal with strings or ditch the euro. Chris Scicluna of Daiwa Capital Markets  the failure raised the risk of a \"disorderly conclusion\". But he added: \"All is not lost and we see no need for panic just yet.\" (Additional reporting by Adrian Croft, RobertJan Bartunek, Robin Emmott, Francesco Guarascio, Jan Strupczewski, Tom Koerkemeier, Alastair MacDonald and Barbara Lewis in Brussels and Jeremy Gaunt, Angeliki Koutantou and Deepa Babington in Athens; Writing by Alastair Macdonald and Paul Taylor; Editing by Giles Elgood and Paul Taylor) END ________________________________',\n",
       " \"WTO Chief Urges Ratification of Trade Facilitation, Public Health Agreements By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 19, 2015 Feb. 18 — During a Feb. 17 Parliamentary Conference in Geneva, the directorgeneral of the World Trade Organization outlined a shortlist of actionable items that international lawmakers can advance before  end. Roberto Azevedo urged international lawmakers in attendance to deliver on their promises to ratify the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) and the TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement on Public Health. Meanwhile, Azevedo acknowledged that WTO rules remain stuck in the past and that members have not changed their positions regarding some of the trickiest issues of the Doha Development Agenda. There is a need to make progress on the 2001 Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, he . “The reality is that our legal texts are yet to properly enter the 21st century.” Trade Facilitation Agreement Azevedo urged attendees to return to their capitals and seek ratification of the TFA to simplify customs procedures valued at nearly $1 trillion in projected efficiencies. To date, three WTO members have ratified the TFA—the U.S., Singapore and Hong Kong. After twothirds of the members submit their instruments of acceptance, the TFA will be ratified and enter into force. “Kenya Minister Amina Mohamed has urged WTO members to ensure that this threshold is reached by the time of the 10th Ministerial Conference in Nairobi this December,” Azevedo . “So I think that puts the ball in your court. Your support as parliamentarians is vital to ensure that your domestic processes are completed,” he . Such a goal is considered lofty by some U.S. and European Union officials, who have previously  that it could take up to five  to reach the twothirds threshold. Public Health Agreement Azevedo  that it “high time” to ratify the TRIPS Agreement on Public Health, which provides developing countries with increased access to certain patentprotected medicines. Though the agreement was originally adopted in 2003, it requires ratification from twothirds of the WTO 160 members to go into effect. Azevedo noted that the agreement needs only 27 more acceptances to enter into force and urged members to submit the remaining acceptance letters before the end of the . “I am convinced it is an eminently achievable goal to secure these acceptances this ,” Azevedo . “To build momentum, I have written to ministers of all WTO members concerned asking them to consider taking this step.” Doha Goals WTO members have made “some good progress” in their negotiations towards producing a detailed work program to resolve the remaining Bali Ministerial issues by July 31, Azevedo . Over the past two months members have engaged the historically challenging goals of modernizing the WTO agriculture rules regarding market access, export subsidies and public stockholding for food security purposes. “While the broad positions have not changed a great deal since last time these issues were discussed, it is clear to me that the tone of the discussion has changed,” Azevedo . “And, significantly, from my conversations with ministers, I have a sense that there has been a big increase in the political will behind our work. This is invaluable.” “We need to redouble our efforts and complete this work—and we need you to help keep governments engaged, to keep the focus on these negotiations, and to build and maintain the political will which is so essential,” he . LDC Issues Azevedo separately asked members of the WTO leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) to define their positions on the items of the July 31 work program “as early as possible,” during a Feb. 18 speech at the LDC Group Ambassadors and Experts Retreat. Azevedo urged LDC members to avoid repeating their old positions and endeavor to break new ground in the Doha negotiations. “Think about what you really want and need—think about what would make the biggest difference to your interests,” he . “Be specific. If you can do that I am very confident that members will respond positively.” Azevedo  that he has a “clear sense” from his conversations with members that the flexibilities for LDCs will remain intact in the negotiations. “I haven't heard anything which would suggest that this is not the case,” he . “But, of course, this doesn't mean you should just sit back, relax and not engage.” General Council Meeting Azevedo is expected to address the state of the WTO trade negotiations at the Feb. 20 General Council meeting. The WTO heads of delegations will next convene for an informal General Council meeting scheduled for Feb. 19 in Geneva. Members are expected to discuss the appointments of new officers to chair the WTO various committees.\",\n",
       " 'Azevedo Solicits Lawmakers’ Help By Adam Behsudi | 2/18/15 5:47 AM EST POLITICO World Trade Organization DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo in a speech on Tuesday called on legislators from around the world to ratify the Trade Facilitation Agreement as well as a public health amendment agreed to by the organization in 2005. Azevêdo argued that parliaments play a crucial role in updating global trade rules. “You support us through approving and ratifying what we agree here,” he . “You do it through your advocacy for the WTO — and the pressure that you apply to your governments to engage on the key issues. But, most ly, you do it by connecting the WTO to your constituents. Everything we do here is for their benefit.” In addition to securing ratification of the TFA by twothirds of the WTO membership — which would allow the agreement to take effect — Azevêdo also called on the lawmakers to help achieve full implementation of the package of decisions agreed to by ministers in Bali at the end of 2013. He also emphasized the need for political will in order to bring the longstalled Doha round of negotiations to a conclusion. Read more here: http://bit.ly/1Joxa5G',\n",
       " 'WTO Offers Preference On Services Export to Developing Economies by Femi Adekoya 18 February 2015 All Africa Feb 18, 2015 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) AS part of efforts to aid the realization of its Bali Package, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has unveiled plans to support the growth of services trade in leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) by providing their services exports with preferential treatment. According to the WTO Services Council, the measures would aid the implementation of a key Bali decision in support of LDCs, which aims to enhance their participation in world services trade. Indeed, some preferences would include, expanding access for the temporary movement of businesspeople (Mode 4) from LDCs for a range of services professions and occupations; waiving fees for business and employment visas for LDC persons; not imposing economic needs and labour market tests for LDC members; and extending the duration of stay of LDC professionals in the markets of preference granting members. These preferences will be implemented once these members have completed their domestic processes and have notified the WTO. At the meeting, over 25 members indicated services sectors and modes of supply\" from LDCs1 to which they would give preferential treatment. In a video message to open the meeting, DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo : \"It is vital that we implement all the elements of the Bali Package without delay and particularly the decisions on LDC issues. The decision on Operationalising the LDC Services Waiver is one of these, and is extremely . Services exports from LDCs are increasing rapidly, though of course they are starting from a very low base. We have a duty to support the growth of this sector. I urge potential preferencegranting members to indicate where they intend to provide preferential treatment to LDC services and service suppliers. \" Chairperson Choi Seokyoung of the Republic of Korea reported a \"very high level of engagement \" from developed and developing countries in a position to do so who considered treating services exports from LDCs more favourably than those of other WTO members. In their indications, members addressed most of the 74 services sectors in which LDCs have requested preferences. Members based their announcements on a collective request that the WTO Group of LDCs submitted on 21 July 2014, in which they indicated services sectors and modes of supply of interest to them. The WTO services agreement, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, specifies that each member shall provide nondiscriminatory treatment to services and service suppliers of other WTO members (MostFavoured Nation principle). The LDC Services Waiver, adopted at the WTO Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8) in 2011, allows nonLDC members to grant preferences to provide all LDCs greater access to their markets. For the first time, this decision allows WTO members to deviate from their MostFavoured Nation obligation under the services agreement. Furthermore, many WTO members mentioned various technical assistance initiatives to improve LDC services export capacity. The initiatives include training programmes for LDC service suppliers and support to upgrade infrastructure. Some members announced new initiatives and measures. In his concluding remarks, the chairperson noted that this meeting was \"one  stepping stone towards the operationalization of the waiver, but not the final concluding step. Today indications show that we are firmly on the way of a joint journey \". Bangladesh Minister for Commerce, Tofail Ahmed MP, spoke about the potential of services to support growth in his country.',\n",

According to a press release, issued here Tuesday, a 2Member delegation from the National Assembly was in Geneva for participation in the conference. During the deliberations of the Conference, he stressed the importance of implementation and institutionalization of International Trade Agreements that guaranteed sustainable trade development. Trade promotion was also the best measure to help resolve conflicts through peaceful means. It was also one of the development tools at the disposal of all for improving living conditions of the people. The parliamentarians were people representatives, they reflected the will of the people and thus there was a strong need to make the best possible use of the potential of trade as a driver for peace and prosperity, he . The Pakistan delegation highlighted the importance of such parliamentary activities and  that the WTO required ensuring that the TF agreement and the public stockholding for food security should be the common denominator for all, rather than a few. Pakistan was afraid that the mechanism for food security might distort trade if there were inadequate checks and balances. \"How will the WTO ensure that food security, does not become a threat to peace and better living conditions for other members\", was the question that the Members asked the Organizers while thanking them for organizing the event.',\n",
       " 'EU Opens New Chapter In Civil Aircraft Dispute By Seeking WTO Panel Posted: February 18, 2015 World Trade Online The European Union has opened a new chapter in the longstanding fight with the United States over subsidies each side provides to its respective manufacturers for the development of large civil aircraft by seeking a dispute settlement panel in the World Trade Organization (WTO) over a new round of tax breaks provided to Boeing by Washington state. According to the EU panel request made on Feb. 12, these subsidies are prohibited under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) because they are contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods in law and in fact. The panel request has been placed on the agenda for the Feb. 23 meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body. It follows formal WTO consultations with the U.S. on Feb. 2, which failed to resolve the dispute, according to the EU panel request. “The EU had no choice, therefore, but to proceed with the next step in the WTO litigation and request the establishment of a panel,” an EU commission spokesman  this week. The EU sought formal WTO consultations on these subsidies on Dec. 19. At issue are the subsidies extended in the Washington state law known as Substitute Senate Bill 5952, which were successful in securing a Boeing commitment to assemble its new 777X jetliner and the plane’s carbon fiber wing in Washington state. The measure, which was passed in 2013, extended a range of existing tax breaks to Boeing and other aerospace companies from 2024 to 2040. According to the EU panel request, the bill explicitly conditions “billions of dollars in subsidies on the use of aircraft components manufactured in Washington state.\" Accordingly, these measures are prohibited under ASCM Article 3.1 (b) on local content subsidies and Article 3.2 that prohibits signatories from maintaining such subsidies, the EU . The EU also notes that prohibited subsidies, when determined by the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, must be withdrawn by the party that maintains them “without delay.\" The biggest tax breaks cited by the EU in its consultation request are reductions in the Washington state business and occupation tax for aerospace companies. In its earlier case against government subsidies to Boeing, known as DS353, the EU unsuccessfully charged that the same tax breaks, extended from 2006 to 2024, were prohibited subsidies contingent on exports. Neither the panel nor the Appellate Body upheld that EU argument on prohibited subsidies. The EU panel request also points out that the new dispute settlement process it has requested is under an expedited timetable because it relates to prohibited subsidies. For example, under Article 4.6 of the ASCM, a panel dealing with prohibited subsidies claims is to issue its ruling within 90 days instead of the six months set for decisions in other disputes. In addition, it stipulates under Article 4.12 that the timelines applicable to those cases are generally half those of other disputes. “The European Union expects that the panel will observe these expedited time periods,” the panel request says. One deadline stipulated in Article 4.4 is the right of a complaining party to request a panel within 30 days of its consultation request, though this can be extended by mutual agreement with the respondent. By making its panel request on Feb. 12, the EU clearly extended the 30day timeline. The new panel request comes as two earlier WTO cases, the successful EU challenge against government subsidies to Boeing (DS 353) and the successful U.S. challenge of EU member state subsidies provided to Airbus (DS316), remain mired in WTO litigation to determine if each party has complied with the adverse rulings. Those decisions are expected in the middle and end of 2015, respectively.',\n",

Analysis The president, Rafael Correa, has threatened to withdraw the country from the Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN, the Andean Community, comprising of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) following a ruling from the CAN general secretariat against Ecuador imposition of import tariffs on its fellow CAN members, Colombia and Peru, in early January. Ecuador rejects the CAN order that it reimburse its trade partners for the lost income as a result. According to the Servicio Nacional de Aduana del Ecuador (the customs agency), from January 5th to February 5th, it earned US$16m from the safeguards (levied at 21% on Colombia and 7% on Peru). Ecuador insists that the safeguard tariffsimposed as a remedial measure to mitigate the recent devaluation of its neighbours' currencies against the US dollarare permissible under CAN rules. Following bilateral talks with Colombia and Peru (outside of the auspices of the CAN), it agreed first to limit and then remove the measures altogether at the end of February. However, it is now considering a more general set of safeguards that it says will be compliant with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, the details of which are pending. In addition, the government has announced a WTOcompliant drawback scheme in support of selected export sectors that will allow local companies to recoup around US$253m in taxes. The government maintains that its trade policies aim to protect domestic liquidity, which is under severe pressure this  amid a sharp drop in oil export earnings. According to the Banco Central del Ecuador (the Central Bank), there was a trade deficit of US$727m in 2014. Although this was an improvement compared with a deficit of US$1bn in 2013, the drop came as a result of a sharp decrease in the fourth quarter (a deficit of US$1bn, offsetting the US$351m of the first three quarters), following a decline in the international price of oil, a trend that is expected to continue this . Ecuador exit from the CAN would leave just three full members (Bolivia, Colombia and Peru).\",\n",

A total of 20 billion baht was made available through a buffer fund for Thailand staterun Rubber Estate Organisation to buy rubber from the market for resale, part of a 58 billion baht subsidy plan to support rubber prices announced in October. \"The cabinet passed a 6 billion baht budget to aid rubber prices,\" Thai Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives Petipong Pungbun Na Ayudhya told reporters on Wednesday following a cabinet meeting. About 4 billion baht would be used to buy RSS3 grade rubber and 2 billion baht will be spent on supporting latex rubber, he . This is the second time the buffer fund has been used. The government had previously withdrawn 6 billion baht in December. Thailand, the world No. 1 rubber producer and exporter, has been hit hard by excess supply and weak demand but state support has helped reduce its large rubber stocks,  a Thai trader, who declined to be named. The government had previously  it would only intervene in the market if it had agreed sales, to avoid building up stockpiles similar to those accumulated under the subsidy schemes of the previous government and to wean farmers off a culture of subsidies. Rubber farmers defied a law banning political gatherings in December and held rallies calling on the military government to support falling prices. Soontorn Rakrong, a member of a rubber farmers group, was unimpressed. \"We did not support this rubber fund from the start but we will not block it either,\" he told Reuters. \"This fund will help companies and cooperatives but not your average farmer.\" Thai RSS3 prices were at $1.89 per kg on Wednesday, up from $1.72 per kg at the start of February.

       " 'Obama OKs drone exports, with many caveats By Philip Ewing | 2/17/15 5:41 PM EST POLITICO President Barack Obama opened the door Tuesday to selling more armed drones overseas — but only to governments that pass what the administration calls a stringent screening process. “As other nations begin to employ military [unmanned aerial systems] more regularly and as the nascent commercial UAS market emerges, the United States has a responsibility to ensure that sales, transfers and subsequent use of all U.S.origin UAS are responsible and consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” the State Department . Some U.S. allies already buy American drones. Britain’s Royal Air Force operates the General Atomicsbuilt MQ9 Reaper, which carries Lockheed Martin’s Hellfire missile. NATO is buying the unarmed Northrop Grummanbuilt Global Hawk. Other nations operate the small, catapultlaunched Scan Eagle, built by a company owned by Boeing. With this beachhead established, the unmanned systems industry’s trade group and the top dronebuilders have spent  pushing the government to permit more overseas sales, arguing the U.S. must exploit its technological edge and not let foreign competition catch up. Tuesday’s announcement was designed to try to thread the needle and open more overseas markets to U.S. vendors but keep the oftencontroversial drones out of the hands of potential abusers. It’s unclear how quickly sales would begin under the new requirements. “The United States’ new UAS export policy establishes the standards by which the United States will assess, on a casebycase basis under the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, potential exports of military UASes, including armed systems,” the State Department announcement . “The new export policy puts in place stringent conditions on the sale or transfer of military UAS.” Buyers must agree to “use these systems in accordance with international law,” “only when there is a lawful basis for use of force under international law” and not to “conduct unlawful surveillance or use unlawful force against their domestic populations,” among other restrictions. Upsides include “interoperability” with allies operating the same drones as, for example, the U.S. Air Force, the administration says. That could reduce American troops’ workload and be a potential windfall for dronebuilders. “It also ensures appropriate participation for U.S. industry in the emerging commercial UAS market, which will contribute to the health of the U.S. industrial base, and thus to U.S. national security which includes economic security,” the State Department . The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, the top droneindustry advocate, has estimated that the U.S. “economic impact” from remotely operated systems could grow to $82 billion by 2025. Remotely operated aircraft have already revolutionized military operations and AUVSI and dronebuilders argue they could do the same for the energy industry, agriculture, law enforcement and other applications. But the American use of armed General Atomicsbuilt Predator and Reaper drones in countless counterterror operations overseas has created serious political and image problems for unmanned systems advocates. The military and CIA drone program is shrouded in secrecy and blamed for the deaths of many civilians accidentally killed in strikes aimed at terror leaders. That controversy and public fears about government surveillance have led to political backlash in parts of the U.S. For example, local governments have banned the presence of remotely operated aircraft even as the Federal Aviation Administration evaluates how users will be permitted to operate them in domestic airspace. In its latest update to drone rules, FAA  Sunday that it would permit the lowlevel use of commercial drones under 55 pounds by 2017. Tuesday’s decision to export armed drones could spark global fears about dictators or authoritarian governments getting hold of stateoftheart American systems and using them to monitor or attack their own populations. The Obama administration has quietly permitted its shipments of tanks, fighter aircraft and other weapons to the government of Egypt, for example, after temporarily holding them up after Cairo imposed a political crackdown. U.S. officials may find themselves walking a tightrope as they deal with similar situations involving drone sales. The U.S. is already the world’s largest global arms dealer, with agreements around the world valued at about $72 billion in 2011, according to the most recent report from the Congressional Research Service.',\n",
       " \"Congressional Research Service Reissues Report on IndustrySpecific Patent Laws By Tony Dutra WTO Reporter, February 19, 2015 Feb. 17 — The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reminded Congress of its commitment under the Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in a Feb. 6 reissued report on Tailoring the Patent System for Specific Industries. The report was first published a  ago, highlighting the changes to the Patent Act made via the America Invents Act (AIA) that were “specific to particular types of inventions, including business methods, tax strategies, and human organisms.” It also noted feeshifting “loser pays” legislation pending before Congress that, at one time, was limited to patents covering computer hardware or software. The “Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), requires patents to be available and enforceable ‘without discrimination as to\\u2009…\\u2009the field of technology,'\\u2009” the report . In a subsection titled The Feasibility of SectorSpecific Patent Rules, the CRS report focused on TRIPS' considerations but highlighted some “exceptions” to that broad rule: a country right to “exclude from patentability inventions whose commercial exploitation would violate the public order or morality,” in Article 27, and “limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent,” such as exempting scientific experiments and acts for obtaining regulatory approval, in Article 30. “U.S. legislation could simply track the exceptions identified by the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, with particular reference to their interpretation by WTO dispute resolution panels,” the report recommended, though it pointed to no legislation in particular. The CRS report was republished a day after the House reintroduced the Innovation Act, which is primarily directed at addressing purported abuses in patent infringement litigation and, more particularly, at socalled patent trolls. The report does not refer to the Innovation Act, and that bill inclusion of a “loser pays” provision is not industryspecific. The report appeared to douse any argument that a bill targeting specific patent owners would violate the TRIPS Agreement. The AIA had broadened the “prior commercial use” defense to patent infringement but barred its use “if the patented invention was made by an institution of higher education.” This “university exception” appears to comply with the TRIPS Agreement because it draws a distinction based upon the identity of the inventor, rather than on a [technology] ground identified in Article 27.1,” the report .

Officials acting for the Geneva public prosecutor began to search the premises of the bank’s Swiss arm on Wednesday morning. “We are looking for everything and anything we can find — documents and files,” the prosecutor . The decision to investigate the bank over allegations of “aggravated money laundering” was taken this week, it added. The prosecutor  the scope of the investigation would affect individuals suspected of having committed or participated in money laundering. The search was carried out by officials under the direction of Olivier Jornot, the Geneva public prosecutor, and Yves Bertossa, prosecutor. The raid appeared to take HSBC by surprise. The first some of the bank’s executives knew of it was when the Geneva prosecutor put out a press release as the raid started. On Wednesday, the bank : “We have cooperated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft in 2008 and we continue to cooperate.” The search came 10 days after Europe’s biggest bank by assets was the subject of allegations that it colluded in taxdodging by clients of its Swiss operation. Last week, HSBC admitted its Swiss private bank may have held accounts for taxdodging customers in the past. The admission came after account details of more than 100,000 clients, including about 7,000 in the UK, were leaked to the media. The bank has been caught up in a swirl of disputes over its practices It was alleged the Swiss unit handed clients large, untraceable bricks of cash in foreign currencies and colluded with them to conceal “black” accounts from tax authorities. The bank, which  it was “accountable for past control failures”, is facing criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina. HSBC  it had “implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money”. People who could face questions from the Geneva public prosecutor about the affair include Peter Braunwalder, who was chief executive of HSBC’s Swiss private bank between 200208 — the time when much of the controversial activity is alleged to have taken place. Mr Braunwalder sat on the board of Swedish bank Nordea until last  and is still president of Thommen Medical, the Swiss dental implant maker. He was succeeded by Alexandre Zeller, who ran the Swiss operation until 2012. HSBC’s global private banking operation was run out of London between 1998 and 2006 by Clive Bannister, who is now chief executive of Londonlisted insurer Phoenix Group. He was succeeded by Chris Meares, who left HSBC in 2011 and is now chairman of Quilter Cheviot, a UK investment firm. All of the men either declined to comment or were unavailable for comment. Since the appointment of Stuart Gulliver as chief executive in 2011, HSBC has increased compliance staff to 6,000 from 1,500 and has been spending an additional $500m to $1bn, the bank  in August. The bank placed advertisements in the press over the weekend to apologise for the alleged conduct of its Swiss unit, and  the events dated back eight . The majority were  to have taken place between 200507. On Saturday, Lord Green, HSBC chairman from 200610, stepped down as chairman of The City UK, a financial services body, to avoid damaging its operations in the wake of the private banking scandal. HSBC was drawn into another controversy on Tuesday, when Peter Oborne quit as chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph after accusing the UK newspaper of failing to run negative stories about the bank, one of its big advertisers. In Switzerland, some banking executives  HSBC was unlucky to have been the subject of this level of scrutiny over its past actions. One Swiss executive, who requested anonymity, : “I doubt HSBC was the only bank to have faced these kinds of issues.” Guenther Dobrauz, head of legal and regulatory services at the Zurich office of PwC, the consultancy,  he expected further scandals and investigations of this nature at other Swiss institutions in the coming months. “There are still a lot of legacy issues from historical business models that will increasingly come to the fore,”  Mr Dobrauz. “I am expecting [a development in this area] every other day as cleaning up history usually takes a bit of time. I expect there are still quite a few of those skeletons around, but just because one thing pops up, I would not say the whole [system] is bad.” HSBC will report its annual results for 2014 in London on Monday and Douglas Flint, its chairman, is due to appear before the Treasury select committee two days later to face questions from MPs about the affair.

       " \"WTO Chief Seeks to Spur Members' Engagement in Work Program Discussions By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 20, 2015 Feb. 19 — World Trade Organization DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo will discuss members' progress towards advancing a detailed postBali work program, according to the agenda of the Feb. 20 General Council meeting. Azevedo likely will urge members to increase their efforts and seek detailed trade negotiations—in the areas of agriculture, nonagricultural market access, and services—before July 31. Separately, the chairman of the WTO General Council, Jonathan Fried, will update members on the implementation work of the 2013 Bali Ministerial decisions among the WTO various councils and committees. The General Council is then expected to elect its new chairperson for 2015 and announce the chairpersons of more than a dozen WTO committees, councils and working groups. Agriculture Talks Earlier this , Azevedo launched an intensive process aimed at getting members to identify and prioritize substantive issues for agreement related to the Doha Development Agenda. As part of that process, Azevedo and John Adank, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture in Special Session, held various consultations with members to discuss the WTO agriculture rules regarding market access, export subsidies and public stockholding for food security purposes. “There has been a good level of attendance and engagement at these consultations which has highlighted the growing realization among members that the key issues need to be tackled in a detailed and concrete way,” Adank  in a report released Feb. 19. “The focus so far in these consultations has been mostly on the domestic support and market access pillars,” he wrote. “However this does not mean that they are more  than other issues. As I have emphasized, it is clear that all elements within the agriculture framework are interrelated and there seems to be a general acceptance that they will need to be dealt with as an overall package.” Domestic Support Questions remain as to how members can modernize domestic support rules for agricultural products and many are looking for indications of what the U.S. is willing to do, according to participants involved in the discussions. Last month, members reviewed a paper that detailed how key WTO members would be affected if they adjusted their present domestic support levels according to the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4) proposal. The paper found that only the U.S. would have to adjust its domestic support levels to achieve compliance under the Rev. 4 proposal. Modalities are formulas for various outcomes, including reducing tariffs and tradedistorting remedies, last revised in 2008. The U.S. has voiced its reluctance to agree to Rev.4 which it  no longer makes sense when India and China are the top two users of tradedistorting agricultural subsidies (15 WTO, 1/23/15). Meanwhile, India and China insist that members accept Rev.4 as the logical starting point for the negotiations. Market Access Efforts to negotiate tariff reductions have reached a low level of ambition stemming from significant disagreements among key members. The U.S.  any final agreement must ensure commercially meaningful access and asked members like Brazil, India and China for more precision on what they are willing to commit to. India has maintained its reluctance to reveal what tariffs it would consider cutting. An informal proposal by Argentina to adopt a “request and offer” approach to market access was derided as chaotic and secretive. The European Union sought to simplify matters with average cuts that aim to balance out the disparities between high and low tariffs. Discussions over a pair of Group of 33 (G33) developing country proposals regarding special products and a special safeguard mechanism failed to gain traction. Export Subsidy Proposal Members of the Cairns Group have urged members to advance a proposal to eliminate export subsidies in line with the 2008 revised draft modalities by the end of the . The Feb. 6 proposal, which has not yet been made public, urged members to adopt the relevant elements of Rev. 4—namely Section III, paragraphs 160169 and related annexes J, K and L—at the December 2015 Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. The proposal was offered by: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam. It remains unclear how the group would adjust the original timeframe requirements established by Rev. 4. Its text would have required developed countries to eliminate export subsidies by the end of 2013 and developing countries to eliminate their export subsidy entitlements by the end of 2016. Chair Rotations Members are expected to elect Mexican Ambassador Fernando de Mateo, the current chairman of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), as the next chair of the General Council. The WTO DSB chair generally becomes General Council chair after expiration of his or her one term, with some exceptions. Ambassador Harald Neple of Norway will replace De Mateo as DSB chairman. Neple is chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development in Special Session. A consensus agreement on the chair for more than a dozen groups will also be announced, including: the Trade Policy Review Body; the Council for Trade in Goods; Council for Trade in Services; the Council for TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); the Committee on Trade and Development; the Committee on Trade and Environment; the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements; and the Trade Negotiations Committee, among others.\",\n",
       " 'Trading Powers Tussle over Shape of WTO Farm Deal 19 February 2015 Bridges Volume 19 Number 6 Despite a raft of new proposals, trading powers continue to tussle over the shape of a new farm trade deal at the WTO, sources familiar with the latest consultations have . A small group meeting convened on Monday by the organisation’s DirectorGeneral, Roberto Azevêdo, made only modest headway in clarifying whether trading powers could accept the “architecture” of a proposed deal on agricultural domestic support that was drafted over six  ago, trade officials told Bridges. “It was too general,”  one negotiator. “Nobody sent a clear signal.” Sources  that 16 ambassadors were invited to attend, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Canada, China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Lesotho, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uganda, and the US. Negotiators are scrambling to meet a July deadline for agreement on a “work programme” on the unresolved issues in the longrunning Doha Round of trade talks, which after successive stalemates was resurrected at the WTO’s ninth ministerial conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013. Three “elephants” key Meanwhile, new formal and informal submissions from farm exporting countries appear to have met a mostly wary reception from other WTO members. A number of negotiators told Bridges that major trading powers first needed to define both what they want from others and what concessions they could make before the talks could move forward. “Basically we have three elephants in the room: the US, India, and China,” one trade official . Others singled out the US in particular. “It’s unclear what they want, don’t want, or could pay,” one developed country negotiator claimed. The US reportedly repeated demands for increased market access in large developing economies, and for domestic support concessions in China and India. However, negotiators told Bridges that if Washington is obligated to make higher farm subsidy payments under the new US Farm Bill, it may find it difficult to offer trade concessions in return. Poultry, pork, sugar, maize and wheat “The US wants more market access in China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil,” one source , specifying that increased access for poultry, pork, sugar, maize, and wheat were seen as particularly  by the country’s negotiators. Others questioned whether the US’ demands were realistic given the steep tariff cuts Beijing had accepted when it joined the global trade body after gruelling accession talks over a decade ago. Some  that the US also wanted to see cuts in China’s proposed ceiling for trade distorting support under the WTO’s “de minimis” allowance, which under current rules is capped for Beijing at 8.5 percent of the value of production. A clause in the 2008 draft text states that proposed new farm subsidy rules should not constrain recently acceded members – such as China – from using this allowance after the Doha Round has been concluded. “If we want concrete progress, we need to respect each other’s red lines,”  one negotiator familiar with the consultations. Eliminating export subsidies A new proposal from a group of agricultural exporting countries argues that WTO members should agree to fasttrack progress on export subsidies and related measures under the talks on “export competition.” The cosponsors argue that proposed commitments in this area should be adopted at the trade body’s tenth ministerial conference, which is scheduled to be held this December in Nairobi, Kenya. The proposal is supported by a subset of the Cairns Group of farm exporters, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam. The extensive negotiations on this topic and the relative maturity of the proposed new disciplines in this area meant that the new proposal was “not very surprising,” one trade official told Bridges. Tropical products: “fullest liberalisation” Another group of farm exporting countries has also called for the trade body to build on past negotiations aimed at liberalisation for their exports of “tropical products.” The group – composed of eight Latin American countries – recalls the 2009 breakthrough in talks between the EU, the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and the “tropical products group,” saying that this and subsequent progress should form the basis for further discussions. (See Bridges Weekly, 16 December 2009) At the same time, the July work programme should reaffirm the trade body’s longstanding commitment to deliver results on the “fullest liberalisation” of trade in tropical products, the group says. Request and offer? Sources also  that an informal nonpaper from Argentina reportedly explored whether countries could usefully pursue a “request and offer” approach in a bid to achieve market access gains under the longrunning talks. Countries would request trade concessions from negotiating partners, and also identify areas in which they could make reciprocal offers, sources familiar with the proposal . Concessions would then be “multilateralised” or extended to all WTO members according to the trade body’s longstanding principles. Initial responses suggested that the proposal had met with a cool reception from other negotiating partners. “I haven’t heard any of my colleagues show much real enthusiasm for this proposal,” one trade official told Bridges. Another questioned whether the approach would even be feasible, given the complexity of negotiating concessions among the organisation’s 160 members. Time running out Some delegates expressed concern that the talks were still at an early stage, given the limited time remaining until the July deadline was reached. “Time is running out fast – it’s almost March,”  one. Others openly questioned whether the deadline would be respected. One developed country delegate acknowledged that many capitals were still trying to understand the formulas for cuts to farm subsidies and tariffs, and review how the draft disciplines in the 2008 draft would actually affect trade in today’s world. “We’re digging up the old presentations from 2008,” the source . However, another negotiator told Bridges that the talks could move ahead fast if there was a sudden breakthrough. “Everything could go very quickly,” the official observed.',\n",
       " 'U.S. farm lobbies call for action over India, China subsidies By Tom Miles GENEVA, Feb 19 (Reuters) Big developing countries such as China and India are routinely breaking international trade rules on agriculture and the U.S. government should take action to stop them, representatives of U.S. corn and rice growers  on Thursday. \"It time for action,\" Robert Cummings, chief operating officer of USA Rice Federation, told Reuters in Geneva, home of the World Trade Organization. \"We\\'ve had enough  of noncompliance and it time for that noncompliance to be made known here and also made known to the U.S. government, and that a response be forthcoming, if the WTO is going to remain viable.\" Shannon Schlecht, vice president of policy at U.S. Wheat Associates Inc,  a reality check was needed as the WTO enters the next stage of global trade talks, when some trade diplomats expect the United States to be under pressure to make concessions on agriculture. \"We want to see compliance and there are some ways to get that,\" he . Cummings and Schlecht were speaking at the offices of King & Spalding in Geneva, a law firm specialising in international trade law and disputes at the World Trade Organization, a day after addressing around 40 trade diplomats at the WTO. Their assertions were based on a study of five leading developing nations, China, India, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand, by agricultural trade lobbying firm DTB Associates, LLP. DTB founder Craig Thorn, a former U.S. agricultural trade negotiator,  the five countries had rapidly increased their minimum support prices for crops and breached the maximum \"aggregate measure of support\" that they are allowed to provide. \"To the extent that these countries have notified their policies, they have in our opinion in every case cheated on their notifications,\" Thorn . Recent WTO negotiations have been dominated by India demand for developing countries to be allowed to stockpile subsidised crops, an amendment that allows them to break the normal WTO rules, provided they meet certain conditions. But no country was likely to invoke that exemption unless there some danger of them being sued, Thorn , and even then they would find it difficult to show the subsidies did not distort trade, as was required. \"We\\'re pretty confident that the trade price effects of these policies are huge and measurable,\" he . Earlier on Thursday, Thailand filed charges against its former prime minister for her role in a rice subsidy scheme that has cost the state billions of dollars. Cummings  that if any of Thailand stockpiled rice made it into the export market at a price less than acquisition, Thailand would be automatically in violation of the WTO rules. \"We\\'re putting the facts on the table here, and we\\'re also putting the facts on the table for our government back home,\" he . \"It probably fair to say that we\\'re getting a more favourable reaction as time goes on and as we\\'re bringing more facts to the U.S. government.\" (Reporting by Tom Miles.

       " \"India backs incentives to export 1.4 mln T raw sugar: government source By Mayank Bhardwaj and Nigam Prusty NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) India will give its cashstrapped sugar mills an incentive to produce and export raw sugar, a senior government official  on Thursday, to help cut stocks after five straight  of surplus output. The government will provide a subsidy of 4,000 rupees ($64) a tonne for exports of up to 1.4 million tonnes of raw sugar, the official, who did not wish to be named, told reporters after a meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet. Benchmark New York sugar prices slid around 3 percent on Thursday after India approved sugar export subsidies. Mills in India, the world biggest sugar consumer, lobbied the government to agree export incentives to help cut large stockpiles after lower world prices thwarted their efforts to sell on the world market. India, the world second biggest sugar producer after Brazil, traditionally produces whites, the refined variety. But mills and trade experts say with the help of government incentives sugar companies can now export raw sugar to standalone Asian and African refineries that turn raws into whites. Government sources told Reuters last month that New Delhi could soon approve an export incentive of about 4,000 rupees per tonne. The India Sugar Mills' Association (ISMA), a producers' body of private mills, has forecast output of 26 million tonnes in the  that began in October against 24.4 million tonnes the previous . Between Oct. 1 and Feb. 15, mills have produced 16.7 million tonnes of sugar, up from 14.5 million tonnes in the ago period. Stung by rising supplies, moneylosing mills were forced to dump sugar in the domestic market to raise cash to pay cane growers. This led to a freefall in local prices. India raw sugar exports could halve this  because of the delay in the decision on giving mills incentives for exports. Mills exported more than 1 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2014 and had hoped to export up to 2 million tonnes this . ISMA put the total surplus at about 2.5 million tonnes and  the incentive should apply to another 1.01.5 million tonnes. Mills had more than 7 million tonnes of carryover stocks when the current season began on Oct. 1, 2014, it  in a statement. ($1 = 62.07 rupees) (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)\",\n",

Louis Dreyfus Commodities\\' Imperial Sugar Co and AmCane Sugar LLC are challenging agreements hammered out to end a dispute over Mexican sugar exports, which set a price floor and partly rolled back Mexico open access to the U.S. market, in exchange for suspending hefty import duties. Imperial Sugar Chief Executive Michael Gorrell  the deal would crimp supplies of raw sugar and also locked in too much imported refined sugar at a time when there was significant spare capacity in refining. \"In this environment, every tonne of imported, refined sugar hurts, especially when it dumped and subsidized,\" he told the U.S. International Trade Commission, which is reviewing the suspension agreements signed in December. Imperial, which accounts for 7.5 percent of sugar produced in the United States, and other refiners buy raw sugar, locally and overseas, and in turn compete with imported refined sugar. AmCane Chief Executive David Rosenzweig  the agreements set prices for refined sugar too low, guaranteeing underselling. They would also lead to raw sugar shortages and high prices. \"We are getting hit on two sides,\" he told the ITC. \"The agreements emphasize grower and miller interests over refiners.\" Mexico has  the agreement is not ideal, but preferable to entering into a bitter trade dispute. Experts have warned that if the dispute escalates, Mexico might take retaliatory action against U.S. exports of high fructose corn syrup. \"Mexico is convinced that the agreements will ensure and maintain the delicate balance in trade of sweeteners between Mexico and the United States,\"  Mexican embassy trade official Kenneth Smith Ramos.

       " 'TISA Parties To Narrow Focus In Push For Progress By July Stocktaking World Trade Online Posted: February 19, 2015 After a negotiating round with an overcrowded agenda that yielded little progress, participants in the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) last week agreed to narrow their focus to a handful of areas with the aim of reaching agreement on all but the most controversial elements by a July stocktaking session. As a result, the April 1317 negotiating round hosted by the European Union will have an agenda that will cover at least three and at most five issues, which have shown some momentum already, according to Geneva sources. Likely to be on that agenda are the areas of financial services, telecommunications, and domestic regulation, because they were flagged by ambassadors at the Feb. 9 to 13 negotiating round, they . These sectors are priorities for both the U.S. and EU. But the need to flesh out this agenda has set off a new round of jockeying and a decision will to a large extent depend on what agreement the U.S. and EU can reach, sources . Some sources expected the U.S. to push for the inclusion of a negotiating proposal on ecommerce and transparency on the agenda for the April meeting, but the EU seems cool to that. In the EU view, the transparency proposal reflects the U.S. way of making regulations at the federal level to such an extent that it cannot be applied to the other TISA participants. The guidelines would need to be redrafted in order to be less centered on the U.S. system, one Geneva source . Similarly, the EU sees the ecommerce proposal as needing more work in intersessional meetings between the U.S. and other cosponsors and other TISA participants. Discussing this proposal in the plenary is premature, one source . Geneva sources  that they did not expect the ecommerce proposal to be part of the April agenda as a whole, but one source speculated that some of its elements could be. The ecommerce proposal contains controversial elements proposed by the U.S. that would give private firms broad rights to transmit data across borders without conditions if they are doing so in the context of doing business. It also fights localization requirements by stating that a country that has made a crossborder services commitment cannot then require that a firm have a local presence or the use of a local server as a condition of doing business. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Holleyman last week highlighted what he  was the importance of including these rules in TISA (see related story). The EU, however, has been particularly wary of the U.S. proposal rules on free data flows (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 19, 2014). Other participants are now also under pressure to ensure their proposals have enough support to make it on the agenda which they do not want to be dominated by the U.S. and EU. Norway, for example, has pushed for opening up crossborder supply of insurance for energy exploration, development, production and for offshore energy properties as well as maritime services. Chile wants to liberalize rules for special air services, like aerial fire fighting. The July stocktaking will likely also address the status of the market access negotiations in TISA, which by all accounts are lagging. Pakistan and Paraguay have not yet submitted an initial offer, and initial offers from Mexico and Canada are missing key sectors. One Geneva source  that it has been unclear for some time whether Paraguay would remain part of TISA, but that it may have decided to stay at the table given that Uruguay is now part of the negotiations. Mexico held off on making a full offer because of its own domestic reform initiatives in the energy and telecommunication sectors, and Canada has not yet submitted a financial services offer. But one Geneva source  that Canada at last week meeting  it would submit its financial services offer in April. Some sources insist that there is no specific goal for advancing TISA beyond the July stocktaking, such reaching a final deal on the priority sectors or complete TISA by end. But one Geneva source  that it was clear in the ambassadors\\' meeting last week that countries want to have \"some kind of result\" announced at the World Trade Organization ministerial scheduled for December in Nairobi, Kenya. Sources speculated that one potential announcement could be the agreement on the core text of TISA, which could be the basis for concluding the negotiations in mid2016. Most elements of the TISA text have been in place for a  except for several key outstanding issues. One of them is a proposed obligation billed as a \"most favored nationforward\" obligation, which would commit participants to extend to TISA signatories any services concessions they make in future freetrade agreements with third countries. The U.S. is backing this approach, but it is relatively isolated, with the EU and many other TISA parties cool to the idea. Some make the argument that an MFNforward commitment in TISA would make countries think twice about offering services access in future bilateral trade deals, knowing that they would also have to offer it plurilaterally. Sources have  the fight over this issue has also held up the market access talks in TISA itself (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 19, 2014). One Geneva source questioned the idea that a TISA deal should be announced at the WTO ministerial given the dynamic he  it would create for the efforts to launch a postBali work program. If a TISA deal were announced, that could mean the U.S. would be satisfied with a small outcome on services in the WTO, he speculated. This in turn would eliminate the need for the U.S. to make any major concessions on agriculture or nonagricultural market access in order to gain a substantive services outcome in the WTO, he .',\n",
       " 'TISA Members Reject Turkish Proposal For Health Care Services Annex Inside U.S. Trade 02/20/2015 A majority of participants in the Trade In Services Agreement (TISA) talks last week refused to engage in discussions on a Turkish proposal for a health care services annex, arguing that they do not see this area as a trade issue, according to informed sources. The U.S. and the European Union were among those rebuffing the idea, sources . One source noted that it is very unusual for countries to reject a proposal outright without further discussion. Critics of TISA and other trade agreements including services obligations have long charged that such deals put at risk a country public health systems by opening them to forprofit operators. Public Services International, a labor group, slammed the Turkish proposal as seeking to promote health \"tourism.\" The exchange on the Turkish proposal was part of the Feb. 913 TISA negotiating round, in which members agreed to focus their work on sectors that had shown momentum in the negotiations (see related story). Negotiators also made clear they would not focus on a proposal by the EU under which TISA signatories would extend national treatment for government procurement services contracts to companies that have a juridical presence in their territory. The Turkish proposal was filed in September 2014, and a Turkish concept paper was leaked this  by the Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP) earlier this month. According to the leaked concept paper, Turkey sees a trade opportunity in what it claims is the untapped potential for the globalization of health care services. The paper says this potential is reflected in crossborder delivery of health care services, both through movement of patients to foreign countries for treatment or by electronic means. But according to the paper, the consumption of health care services abroad faces a significant obstacle from the fact that health insurance is not portable. \"We think that establishing a system within TISA in order to facilitate patient mobility via health insurance portability would be a real valueadded,\" Turkey says in the leaked paper. Jane Kelsey, a University of Auckland professor and critic of international trade deals, wrote in an analysis dated Jan. 28 and posted on the AWP website that the proposal would perpetuate the problem of underinvestment in national healthcare systems by promoting offshore treatment.',\n",
       " 'Top China cotton producer resists reforms in restive Xinjiang By Dominique Patton BEIJING, Feb 20 (Reuters) China top cotton producer, a quasimilitary body formed 60  ago to settle the far west Xinjiang area, is resisting a government policy that could force it to cut output in an industry employing hundreds of thousands in the restive region. Beijing has pledged to end a costly stockpiling programme that has artificially inflated cotton prices and in Xinjiang helped underpin an influx of Han Chinese workers, creating friction in an area home to the Muslim Uighur people. Reluctant to accept the current weak market price, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) has asked the government to buy part of its crop and store it in state reserves,  two trade sources with knowledge of the issue. XPCC, also known as the army corps, or \\'bingtuan\\', has become a sort of state within a state and gained a dominant role in industries such as cotton, where it employs about 200,000 mainly Han Chinese on some of Xinjiang best land. \"Cotton is intimately associated with land usage, ownership, employment and Han inmigration. It all tied up,\"  Tom Cliff, a scholar at the Australian National University. Beijing has promised subsidies to help cushion the impact of ending stockpiling, but the total amount is unclear and with the local cotton price plunging any threat to the industry could be a fresh source of competition for jobs. Employment discrimination, experts say, along with a demographic shift that many Uighurs feel is diluting their culture, is fuelling resentment that spills over into violent attacks directed at Han Chinese, China majority ethnic group. China denies that Uighurs are unfairly marginalized, and says it is addressing underdevelopment and lack of jobs in heavily Uighur areas such as southern Xinjiang. Beijing has also pledged to invest billions of dollars in textile factories in Xinjiang, in the hope of creating 1 million jobs by 2023, but there are concern that Uighurs could be overlooked for many of the jobs. AGRICULTURAL REFORM China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which is leading agriculture reform, reiterated in January it would stick to plans to end stockpiling and let the market dictate demand. Beijing previously acquired almost all of China cotton at high prices and then auctioned it off to textile firms. But it incurred huge costs and left masses of fibre unsold in reserves. Its new policy has already caused prices to plunge and some experts say that a subsidy a replacement for stockpiling will not be enough to encourage farmers to keep growing. NDRC could not immediately be reached for further comment. XPCC, which produces almost 30 percent of China cotton, has been keeping its prices at least 500 yuan ($80) per tonne higher than other ginners, limiting sales. \"Normally they (XPCC) have sold everything by March. But now they\\'re out of the market and not competing,\"  one of the Chinabased trade sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This means the group may have to slash its price later in the season if the state doesn\\'t intervene, putting pressure on benchmark local prices that have already lost a third of their value since September. This could also weigh on international prices, with the market counting on demand from China to support prices that last month traded near 51/2  lows. XPCC did not respond to a fax seeking comment on its slow sales to date and its stance on state buying. But Liang Dongya, general manager of XPCC cotton and jute division, told a conference last month the group had sold less than 400,000 tonnes of a 1.76 million tonne crop at end December He  the poor sales should not be blamed on high prices, but were due to a \"very serious\" reduction in demand. \"MAINTAINING SOCIAL STABILITY\" The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects China\\'a cotton consumption to be 7.7 million tonnes in 2014/15 but some believe it could be as low as 6.5 million tonnes. Production, on the other hand, is seen between 6.26.5 million tonnes and, with about 1.5 million tonnes of fibre likely to be imported, bulging stocks may grow further. The status of XPCC gives it substantial lobbying power so even if it accepts the agriculture reforms it is likely to push for more subsidies. Highlighting its stature, a cabinet paper last   the group continued to play a big role in promoting \"unity among ethnic groups and maintaining social stability\" and it also accounted for more than 17 percent of Xinjiang GDP in 2013. \"The bingtuan was born and raised on preferential policies, and I can\\'t see them letting them go without a struggle, or some quid pro quo,\"  Cliff of the Australia National University.

       " 'Tainted Chinese berries may spur reform of Australian food labelling * Thirteen Australians have hepatitis A, more cases expected * Farmers, consumer groups push for changes to product labelling * Tests continue on berries packed in China By Jane Wardell SYDNEY, Feb 20 (Reuters) An outbreak of hepatitis A in Australia, probably caused by frozen berries packaged in China, is giving added impetus to moves to tighten the country murky food labelling laws and could fuel a backlash against imported food. Proposed changes that would more clearly identify the origin of food on supermarket shelves, combined with growing pressure on consumers to buy local produce, may curb the appetite for Chinese imports and could undercut a landmark free trade deal. \"I want to make sure I do everything in my power to say to people \\'your safest food is your domestic food\\',\" Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce  on Wednesday. Thirteen Australians have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, a viral disease affecting the liver, after eating frozen mixed berries sold by Patties Foods Ltd and health officials expect to identify more cases in coming weeks. The berries were grown in Chile and China before being packaged at a Chinese factory, where poor hygiene and tainted water supplies are thought to have caused the health problems. Hepatitis A is passed through contact with material that has been contaminated with faeces from an infected person. The case has given impetus to a bill introduced into the Australian parliament a week ago by the minority opposition Greens Party, which wants more informative labelling on products for sale in Australia. Under current laws, the term \"made from Australian and imported ingredients\" is common, providing no detail on the exact origins of all the ingredients in a product or where it was packaged. Imported food products have to undergo less stringent safety tests during and after production than local produce, farmers\\' groups say. Joyce  the weak countryoforigin labelling laws allowed manufacturers to use \"sneaky terms\" to \"earn a premium\" on cheaply made products. Farming and consumer groups say the case highlights longterm food safety problems in China, the thirdlargest source of Australia food imports, where rapid industrialisation has polluted soil and water supplies. Poor hygiene in production and packaging plants is also a big concern. \"The current issue with imported frozen berries highlights the need for clearer countryoforigin labelling, as it appears consumers may have been confused about where they came from,\"  Ian Harrison, chief executive of lobby group Australian Made Campaign. \"Buy local\" campaigns are increasingly prevalent in Australia and are gaining traction. A July 2013 Roy Morgan poll showed more than 60 percent of Australians sometimes bought products because they were made in Australia even when they were more expensive than imported rivals. Only 12 percent  price would deter them from buying Australian products. TRADE DEALS Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who late last  signed a free trade deal with China, is less enamoured with changing countryoforigin labelling laws, saying he is wary of imposing new regulations that could send food prices soaring. Trade agreements make such changes tricky politically. Australia needs the trade pact with China to help it move from a reliance on exports of coal and iron ore to expanding its food and agricultural shipments to a growing Asian middle class. There is also the risk of appearing contradictory. Australia is one of a number of countries that have taken action in the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States after it introduced its own stronger countryoforigin labelling laws for beef products last . Abbott  the government would look at toughening up screening processes for imported goods but put the impetus on the food industry to make its own checks. Patties Foods has withdrawn the frozen berries from sale and stressed it carried out all the tests required under Australian law but it will probably face a class action lawsuit. Its shares have fallen 10 percent since it announced the product recall over the weekend. (Editing by Alan Raybould)',\n",
       " 'Dubai airline Emirates rejects Delta apology over 9/11 comments By Nadia Saleem and Jeffrey Dastin DUBAI/NEW YORK, Feb 19 (Reuters) An increasingly bitter trade row between U.S. and Gulf airlines deepened on Thursday when Dubai Emirates rejected a Delta Air Lines apology for remarks perceived as linking Gulf carriers with the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. Relations have deteriorated since a group of U.S. airlines compiled a dossier claiming that major Gulf carriers had received $40 billion in subsidies and urged the U.S. government to renegotiate or scrap an Open Skies trade pact. Gulf carriers denied that they received subsidies and  that United Statesbased airlines themselves benefited from $5 billion in government help in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Asked about those counterclaims on CNN this week, Delta CEO Richard Anderson : \"It a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates from the Arabian Peninsula talk about that, given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/11, which came from terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula.\" The comments have infuriated officials in the UAE and Qatar, two U.S. allies that offered military or logistical support for international operations after the 2001 attacks. Delta  that Anderson had been responding to claims that the post9/11 payments to U.S. airlines amounted to subsidies. \"He didn\\'t mean to suggest the Gulf carriers or their governments are linked to the 9/11 terrorists. We apologise if anyone was offended,\" it  in an emailed statement. But Emirates, the largest of the three leading Gulf carriers that also include Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi Etihad, rebuffed the explanation. \"We believe that the statements made this week by Mr. Anderson were deliberately crafted and delivered for specific effect,\" it  in a statement. In the dossier, details of which have been seen by Reuters, U.S. airlines  they have lost significant bookings since 2008 because of Gulf competition and cited documents that they say demonstrate aid including cheap airport fees. Gulf officials say the U.S. carriers do not serve the same routes and are losing traffic because of poorer service. They also say that airport charges are the same for foreign carriers. The row echoes recent friction between Gulf airlines and European carriers such as Lufthansa and comes as some U.S. airlines are also campaigning to close the U.S. ExIm bank, an export credit agency that they say benefits Gulf rivals. Western airlines have  that thousands of service industry jobs are under threat, but Gulf carriers have responded by saying that they support at least as many jobs in the aerospace sector through huge aircraft orders. The challenge to European carriers from growing competition, coupled with economic weakness at home, was highlighted on Thursday when Air FranceKLM declined to give a profit forecast for 2015, sending its shares down 5 percent .

       " 'U.S., South Africa Work To Resolve Meat Fights Amid AGOA Renewal Efforts Inside U.S. Trade 02/20/2015 The U.S. and South Africa have stepped up efforts to resolve a longstanding disputes over antidumping (AD) duties South Africa has imposed on U.S. chicken imports as well as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures that the U.S. has charged are unjustified and a barrier to its exports of beef and pork. South Africa Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries sent a delegation to Washington the week of Feb. 15 to discuss these SPS issues on meat with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), sources . The South African Department of Trade and Industry will come to Washington the week of March 1 for general discussions about the bilateral trade relationship with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, but will likely closely focus on the poultry issue, a South African official . These efforts at resolving these U.S. complaints are taking place against congressional threats that a pending renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) would cut back South Africa benefits. Key House Republicans have publicly indicated that the substance of the AGOA bill is essentially done, but that the length of the renewal and the issue of funding to offset the tariff cuts remain outstanding (see related story). In the poultry dispute, the U.S. industry last week responded with a \"constructive\" offer to a preliminary settlement proposal made by the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) in late January, according to an industry source. That offer was submitted to the National Chicken Council (NCC) and U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC), which viewed it as a starting point (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan. 30). On pork, the U.S. industry has long demanded that South Africa lift measures it has put in place to protect against the spread of three swinerelated diseases: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, pseudorabies and trichinae. In the March 2014 annual report on SPS barriers, USTR  it would continue to work with South Africa to eliminate the freezing requirements to ensure U.S. pork is free of pseudorabies and trichinae. South Africa also bans the import of all U.S. beef products except deboned beef due to fears over the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease. In the 2014 SPS report, USTR  it would \"continue to urge South Africa to open its market fully to U.S. beef and beef products.\" In addition, the U.S. poultry industry has complained about South Africa ban on U.S. poultry imports as a result of highpathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in noncommercial flocks in Oregon, Washington state and Idaho. One industry source  that this has had a chilling effect on the bilateral trade relationship with respect to poultry. In addition to South Africa, a number of other countries have imposed a blanket ban, including China and South Korea, this source noted. Of these countries, he  China, South Korea and South Africa are the most significant markets for U.S. poultry. Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was trying to persuade these countries to roll back their blanket ban and focus only on poultry from certain U.S. regions since the outbreaks were at first confined to noncommercial poultry flocks (Inside U.S. Trade, Jan 16). On Jan. 24, USDA announced the confirmation of an HPAI outbreak in a commercial flock in Stanislaus County, California, but  the department was continuing \"to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to [World Organization for Animal Health] standards and minimize trade impacts.\" The SAPA offer in the chicken dispute was for a tariff rate quota (TRQ) that would charge South Africa most favored nation (MFN) duty as an inquota tariff, and apply the antidumping duties as above quota rates, according to a South African official. The official declined to provide details about the size of the TRQ. South Africa maintains a MFN tariff of 37 percent on bonein chicken products, according to a November 2014 USDA report. It assesses an antidumping duty of 9.4 rand per kilogram, currently about 80 cents, for imports of these products from the U.S. One U.S. industry source  that the U.S. government would prefer that South Africa altogether do away with the dumping duties that have been in place since 2000 by dropping the antidumping case. That same demand was articulated in a Dec. 9, 2014 letter from Sens. Chris Coons (DDE) and Johnny Isakson (RGA) to South African President Jacob Zuma, which they  would otherwise work to cut AGOA benefits for South Africa (Inside U.S. Trade, Dec. 18, 2014).',\n",

U.S. officials are lobbying lawmakers to support legislation allowing the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for a yesorno vote, without amendments, in exchange for setting negotiating goals. \"I think it a very close call right now,\" Vilsack  at the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture Outlook Forum, according to trade publication Inside US Trade. \"I think there still work that needs to be done to make sure that people are comfortable in knowing there adequate transparency, and understanding and appreciating that Congress is not surrendering its power to the executive branch.\" Opponents of trade promotion authority, or fasttrack, include conservative Republicans against granting more authority to the White House and Democrats worried about the impact of trade deals, such as the 12nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), on jobs. As part of the lobbying effort, the White House has posted a YouTube video touting the benefits of trade and senior administration officials are visiting towns and cities around the country and speaking to small businesses. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman toured a Mary Kay cosmetics factory in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has been to Tacoma, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. \"Trade promotion legislation is a hard vote to get passed,\" she  on a media call on Thursday to promote the benefits of trade and exports in Minnesota. \"This is not going to pass by wide margins, it will pass by a small margin, but it will pass because it the right thing to do.\" Experts say fasttrack will give trading partners security deals that will not be picked apart in Congress once they are agreed on and is  to get a good deal on the TPP, which is nearing completion. Trade skeptics are also lobbying lawmakers to reject the bill, which Senate Committee on Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch has  he hopes to introduce this month. A coalition of 35 religious groups including Christian, Muslim and Jewish organizations wrote to members of Congress this week urging them to oppose fasttrack.',\n",
       " 'Concerns persist over Asean economic bloc Jeremy Grant in Singapore Financial Times February 19, 2015 12:51 pm When Google recently tried to move some engineers urgently from Malaysia to Thailand, the search engine titan hit a roadblock. Thai labour laws meant that getting the permits needed to employ Malaysian engineers in the neighbouring southeast Asian country took far longer than it had expected. “The time it takes to move talent where we want means we can’t move as fast as we would like,” says Sajith Sivanandan, chief executive of Google Malaysia. Cumbersome labour laws are just one of the obstacles hampering the creation of a highly anticipated economic bloc called the Asean Economic Community (AEC) that is supposed to be in place across the 10nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by December. As China slows and India’s prospects remain unpredictable, businesses are looking to Asean countries and their 620m population as the next growth frontier in Asia. The aim of the AEC is to knit a hodge\\xadpodge of countries, ranging from economically deprived Laos with 4m people, to Indonesia, the region’s biggest economy, with a population of 250m, to propel growth in the region. Asean has a combined gross domestic product of $2.4tn, which is more than India, and it would rank as the world’s seventh largest economy if it were a country. The Asian Development Bank expects its GDP to grow 5.1 per cent this , well above the 3.5 per cent projected for the world economy by the International Monetary Fund. Najib Razak, Malaysia’s prime minister, talks grandly about the AEC being about creating “an economic union unlike anything since the days of empire”. Yet business leaders, including one of his brothers, see it differently. While they believe the AEC has potential, like Google they are increasingly frustrated by nontariff barriers, protectionism and bureaucracy that could see the project fall far short of the vision set in 2007. “I always think it’s helpful to call a spade a spade,” says Nazir Razak, chairman of CIMB Group, Malaysia’s secondbiggest bank and the prime minister youngest brother. “We should not leave anyone with the expectation that [the] AEC will be the single production base with free movement of goods and services, investment and skilled labour and free movement of capital as currently described.” The banker warns that people and businesses in Asean countries “will be disappointed, or worse, angry, if they get all dressed up for the wrong party”. While significant progress has been made cutting tariffs across Asean countries, businesses must still navigate a thicket of different product standards that make it hard to sell across the region and hamper the ability of new companies to enter the market. The sleep regulation drug melatonin, for example, is considered a health supplement in Singapore but a prescription drug in Thailand. There is also no standard approval process that would allow food ingredients authorised in one Asean country to be sold in another. Nor is Asean a customs union, so importing and exporting within the bloc involves different procedures that often result in goods waiting at ports for weeks until paperwork is cleared, which maximises opportunities for corruption. “Differences in regulations, especially nontariff barriers, remain a serious obstacle to the free flow of goods and services,” says Joerg Wolle, chief executive of DKSH, a Swiss marketing and distribution group that employs 27,000 in the region. One symptom of such barriers is the low level of intraregional trade. McKinsey, the consultancy, estimates that such trade fell to 24 per cent of the Asean’s total trade in 2012, after peaking at almost 25 per cent in 2007. It attributed the decline to nontariff barriers. Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia, possibly the most visible “Asean” company, argues not only that the region needs one aviation authority, but also that the principle should be applied across most industries. “If Asean is to be a common market, investors have to see us as a common market, which means one approving authority — you get one licence to operate in 10 countries,” he  last month. Asean’s policy making body, the Jakartabased Asean secretariat, has made some progress. Last November, it unveiled a pilot customs transit system in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to harmonise procedures for road freight. But business leaders say that with a staff of only 300 and an annual budget of $17m progress will be limited. Differences in regulations — especially nontariff barriers — remain a serious obstacle to the free flow of goods and services Joerg Wolle Such is the level of frustration that companies, unusually for Asean business leaders, have started to lobby policy makers through the Asean Business Club, a group that includes Mr Fernandes and the heads of some of the largest familycontrolled businesses in Asean, including Francis Yeoh, head of Malaysia’s cementtoutilities conglomerate YTL, and Fernando Zobel de Ayala, president of Ayala, a Philippines conglomerate. In addition to identifying six problem sectors, it has proposed seconding private sector experts to the secretariat to speed up capital market integration in Asean countries where progress has been painfully slow. Yet the biggest barrier to the implementation of the AEC may be protectionism. In the motor sector there are already signs that Indonesia is determined to create a national car policy that favours its domestic industry. The Asean Business Club says there are “strong political and nationalistic pressures” to ensure a high percentage of jobs for locals, which may partly explain Google’s difficulties. Mr Nazir warns that given this kind of “powerful enemy”, the AEC needs to show some quick successes to gain credibility. “If too many people, especially those with political careers, see it as a disappointment or that they or their constituents are losers from integration [then] the AEC could stall — or worse reverse.”',\n",
       " 'Germany holds up Greek bid for euro zone loan extension * Athens uses vital EU wording to request extension * Germany dismisses proposal as \"Trojan horse\" * Athens questions whether Berlin speaks for euro zone * But Greece remains isolated after euro zone officials met * Greek bailout deal due to expire on Feb. 28 By Renee Maltezou and Jan Strupczewski ATHENS/BRUSSELS, Feb 19 (Reuters) Germany rejected a Greek proposal for a sixmonth extension to its euro zone loan agreement on Thursday, saying it was \"not a substantial solution\" because it did not commit Athens to stick to the conditions of its international bailout. Berlin stance, describing the carefully worded Greek letter as a \"Trojan horse\" for shirking commitments, set the scene for tough talks at a crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Friday. Greece leftistled government is scrabbling to avoid running out of money within weeks and will face pressure to make further concessions in Brussels. As the biggest creditor and EU paymaster, Germany has the clout to block a deal and cast Greece adrift without a lifeline, potentially pushing it towards the euro zone exit. But some officials in other capitals saw the German response as tactical and forecast agreement by the weekend after more wrangling. Nonetheless, despite warm words from those who saw the Greek move as a step forward, Athens remained isolated after a meeting of euro zone officials to prepare Friday talks, sources close to the negotiations . All agreed with Germany that Greece must commit more clearly to abiding by its current credit terms. A Greek official  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had a 50minute telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, believed to be their first substantive exchange since the Athens government was elected on Jan. 25. \"The conversation was held in a positive climate, geared towards finding a mutually beneficial solution for Greece and the euro zone,\" the official . A German spokesperson confirmed the call but would not comment on the content. Tsipras also spoke to French President Francois Hollande, who, according to a Greek official, promised to raise the issue with Merkel when she visits him in Paris on Friday. Earlier, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis formally submitted the request after days of backstairs negotiations with the European Commission and the chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers of the currency bloc. While officials in Brussels, Paris and Rome welcomed the effort by a government elected on an antiausterity platform to find a workable formula, German officials  it was full of loopholes with no commitment to respect the bailout terms. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble spokesman  the Greek proposal did not meet the criteria agreed by the Eurogroup and \"goes in the direction of a bridge financing without fulfilling the demands of the programme\". Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel  what mattered was what economic reforms Greece was prepared to make, adding: \"The letter can only be the start of negotiations.\" The objections from Berlin drew a tart response from Athens, which questioned whether Germany spoke for the other euro zone finance ministers, whose aides were already in Brussels looking at the options during a meeting on Thursday afternoon. \"Tomorrow Eurogroup has only two options: either to accept or reject the Greek request,\" a Greek official . \"It will then be clear who wants to find a solution and who doesn\\'t.\" A German paper prepared for Thursday meeting of euro zone officials and seen by Reuters  the request was no basis for even starting to draft an accord on Friday. \"The Greek letter is not clear at all, but opens immense room for interpretation,\" it read. \"It ... represents a Trojan horse ... in substance putting an end to the current programme.\" With Greece EU/IMF bailout programme due to expire in little more than a week, Tsipras urgently needs to secure a financial lifeline to keep the country afloat beyond late March. Athens asked for an extension to its \"Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement\" with the euro zone, rather than the full bailout programme as euro zone governments led by Germany have insisted. Tsipras, who won power promising to ditch the bailout, is trying to secure funding without accepting all the demands for austerity and painful economic reform which are conditions of the EU/IMF programme. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew spoke by telephone on Thursday with his Greek, Dutch and French counterparts, urging all sides to make concessions in the talks. NOT TO BERLIN\\'S LIKING Berlin can count on the support of north European fiscal hawks such as Finland and the Netherlands but also countries such as Spain and Portugal which have imposed austerity measures in return for aid and do not want Greece to get a softer deal. But Greece also has sympathisers. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan warned of the risk involved in any Greek exit. \"We have to send a signal that the euro is irreversible,\" he told the magazine l\\'Espresso. \"If a country were to leave, it wouldn\\'t just mean one less country in the union but the transformation of the euro into a mechanism that can be undone.\" Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a socialist who like Tsipras is aged 40 and still new to government, spoke to his Greek counterpart on Thursday, an Italian official . Renzi also spoke to European Commission President JeanClaude Juncker, a euro zone veteran, who has been trying to mediate. In France, cocreator of the euro with Germany, Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls called the Greek move \"a very encouraging sign that a solution is possible, and very quickly\". Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor  a Greek exit would be less financially risky for the remaining euro zone members than it would have been during the last scare in 2012. Since then, policymakers have introduced the European Stability Mechanism, which could help governments under market pressure if Greece were to leave, it noted. In the letter seen by Reuters, Greece pledged to meet its financial obligations to all creditors, recognise the existing EU/IMF programme as the legally binding framework and refrain from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets. It accepted that the extension would be monitored by the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, a climbdown by Tsipras who had vowed to end cooperation with \"troika\" inspectors accused of inflicting deep economic and social damage on Greece. However, the document stopped short of accepting that Greece should achieve a primary budget surplus, excluding debt service, equal to three percent of the country annual economic output this , as promised under the bailout deal. Tsipras wants to cut that to 1.5 percent to allow more spending to ease the plight of the poor. The document spoke only of attaining \"appropriate primary budget surpluses\". Crucial details remain to be clarified on the fiscal targets, labour market reforms, privatisations and other measures due to be implemented under the existing programme. The sixmonth interim period would be used to negotiate a longterm deal for recovery and growth incorporating further debt relief measures promised by the Eurogroup in 2012.',\n",
       " 'Opec has ceded to the US its power over oil price Alan Greenspan Financial Times February 19, 2015 4:37 pm Shale breakthrough will be a more effective market stabiliser, writes Alan Greenspan Normal diplomacy probably could not have achieved the geopolitical outcomes that have been produced in the past  by America’s shale oil revolution. Oil prices have more than halved, which — coupled with the collapse of the rouble that stemmed from the turmoil in Ukraine — has gone a long way towards disabling the Russian economy. Cheap oil has weakened Iran’s economy, too, lifting the chances of a realistic nuclear agreement. Finally, oilrich Venezuela was on the edge of default even before the oil price decline. This amounts to a marked change in the economic and geopolitical landscape, of which the main beneficiaries are the US and its allies. At the root of the price collapse was the development in the US of techniques for extracting tight oil, mostly from shale deposits, by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This reversed the decline in US oil production, adding 3m barrels a day since 2012. As a result, the gap between global production and consumption has widened, precipitating a dramatic rise in US and world inventories and a fall in prices. Saudi Arabia, confronted with an oil supply glut but not wishing to lose market share, abandoned its leadership role as global swing producer and refused to cut production to support prices. After the oil embargo of the 1970s, Opec wrested oil pricing power from the US. But the shale technology breakthrough is likely to be a far more effective stabiliser of oil prices than the cartel of oil producing countries. Opec is now relinquishing its pricing power. It may never be regained. The reason is that shale technology is far more flexible. Shale oil wells can come on stream faster than most conventional wells, and drain far more rapidly. More than half of the oil content of shale wells is run off in the first two  of operation, while conventional wells keep producing for 20  or more. Thus, shale oil output can expand and contract more rapidly than conventional wells. Unlike the production decisions of a monopolistic Opec, fluctuations in market prices will automatically guide shale expansion and contraction. Recent oil price declines, of course, have given consumers considerably more purchasing power. Global consumer outlays are up markedly in the current quarter, but this will be partially offset by slowed capital investment in oilproducing countries this  and next. On balance, the impact of the oil price decline on global gross domestic product appears marginally positive. India, a large crude importer, is among the countries to gain most from falling prices. So is Japan — which has been importing oil to replace the nuclear power capacity that was switched off after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011. China, the US and Europe have also benefited, to a lesser degree. Brent crude prices fell to $45 a barrel in late January, down from $115 in June last  — though they have recently rebounded, to close to $60. Is this a temporary increase as traders cover their short positions, after which prices will resume their slide? The answer is likely to be found in the inventory statistics. For prices to rise, the gap between consumption and production must close. So far, the heavy buildup of inventories of crude and petroleum products, and decline in the number of active drilling rigs, has not arrested the growth in US crude output. A  ago, when prices were high, the conventional wisdom was that, at $60 a barrel, shale oil could not be profitable. Back then, incentives to cut production costs were a low priority; when each barrel was worth more than $100, the most  thing was to get it out of the ground. At today’s prices, costcutting is mandatory. We are about to find out whether shale producers, with their backs to the wall, can keep oil investment innovative and profitable.

       " 'India, US disagree at WTO Press Trust of India 21 fvrier 2015, From Shreerupa Mitra Jha Geneva, Feb 20 (PTI) The United States today  it wants to introduce the concept of \"differentiation\" among developing nations in the trade negotiation on agriculture, a move that has been rejected by countries like India and China. Terming it \"blood for water\" or \"blood for air\", the US  in a general council meeting at the WTO that some studies have indicated that it will have to make significant cuts in the outlays for domestic support under the present draft modalities. Modalities, in trade jargon, imply reduction commitments in tariffs and subsidies in agriculture and tariff cuts in industrial products. Referring to India and China, the US, however,  trade distorting payments have expanded exponentially since 2008, but these countries do not have to do much to reduce their subsidies, an outcome that the US cannot endorse. US farm lobbies, based on a study of five developing nations China, India, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand by an agricultural trade lobbying firm DTB Associates yesterday,  these countries have breached the maximum aggregate measure of support (AMS) and have increased their minimum support prices for crops. Under the Doha Declaration, special and differential treatment for developing countries is integral to enable the countries to meet their needs particularly food security. Developing countries like India and China have rejected the concept of differentiation and have called for respecting the existing mandate. India stated that trade for commercial purposes that impinges on policy space does not lead to development and contended that the present global trading system is highly inequitable and there was a need to level the playing field. The present round was for trade for development, not for enhancing market access and outcomes should be fair and equitable, India stated. China argued it was  not to mix different kinds of domestic support. It  there was a difference between giving domestic support to big and rich farmers and support to poor farmers. The issue of stockpiling for food security purposes as well as the calculation of AMS has been a major area of contention between India, China and other developing countries and the developed countries, primarily the US. India had caused much furore among developed nations last  when it blocked the Trade Facilitation Agreement for cutting down red tape in global trade so its food security programme will not be challenged under WTO rules.

       " \"Services Waiver, Will it benefit Bangladesh? The Daily Star, 20 fvrier 2015 19:00, Mahfuz Kabir AFTER returning from negotiation in Geneva, the commerce minister and his team expressed confidence about access to services market in developed countries by Bangladesh as an LDC. It is clearly vital for the country as the value of service export is $3.7 billion, or more than 10% of total exports as of 2013, and it experienced 92% growth in the last five . The government points of discussion in Geneva were broadly supported by a technical committee on waiver and Unctad country study on services policy review. However, the solution to any problem in WTO has been quite difficult and complicated as far as LDCs are concerned. This matter is, therefore, not expected to get exempted from the tradition in such a multilateral forum that is claimed to overly serve the purpose of dominating members, mostly from global North. The eighth WTO ministerial meeting in December 2011 was a landmark for evolving LDC services waiver as one of the key deliverables. It was indeed a significant achievement due to a lastminute compromise after  of negotiations, in which the WTO members have been allowed to grant preferences to services and service providers of all LDCs. The most crucial part of services for Bangladesh is waiver in movement of natural persons, including professional services, which is popularly known as GATS Mode 4. Originally, a range of LDC modalities were established in 2003 to guide members in accessing developed country markets. These direct members to make specific commitments, attach special priority to providing effective market access in sectors and modes of supply of export interest to LDCs through development of appropriate mechanisms by them towards achieving full implementation of GATS Article IV:3. Furthermore, the set of LDC modalities requires members to make commitments providing access in Mode 4, keeping in mind all categories of natural persons identified by LDCs in their requests. The 8th Ministerial Conference adopted waiver allowing the WTO members to deviate from most favoured nation (MFN) obligation of nondiscrimination in order to grant preferential treatment to service suppliers under Mode 4. Subsequently in Bangladesh, the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment formed a national committee comprising members from this ministry, Ministry of Commerce, BMET and scholars from research organisations to prepare ways and means for negotiating the movement of skilled and semiskilled persons mainly to the developed countries by preparing a 'catalogue.' The US, the most influential WTO member and the most lucrative market in Mode4 for LDCs, was quite diplomatic and kept silent during the services negotiations in earlyFebruary 2015. Even though this scheme sounds lucrative and is a truly special treatment for LDCs, there are many practical predicaments. It expires after 15  of notification under which Members may provide temporary preferential treatment to LDC services and service suppliers on annual basis. However, the countries granting waiver 'must' notify the Council for Trade in Services, which will conduct an annual review and assess whether the exceptional circumstances that justify the waiver still exist or not. To understand the matter, let us suppose that Bangladesh applies to the US for an LDC waiver for its manpower exports in order to secure preferential treatment in which the other competitors are India or Sri Lanka for the same category. In that case, the US is compelled to notify the Council for Trade in Services, which will review annually to see whether Bangladesh is supposed to be provided the waiver. As the US has already shown its 'golden face' by remaining silent in the negotiation meeting, it is unlikely to notify this Council as it may cause more burden and obligation to grant a similar waiver to other LDCs, which would increase its workload. The same can happen for other developed countries like UK, Germany, Italy, France and Canada, where the LDC governments are quite eager to facilitate movement of natural persons. Therefore, fruitful implementation of the waiver is unlikely. Nevertheless, Bangladesh needs to conceive the opportunities under Mode4 as skilldriven, which currently includes the manpower in semi and lessskilled categories also. It would give the country a better dividend to access the developed country market in the medium and long terms. The manpower in the latter categories would find it extremely difficult to get temporary jobs in the developed country market as the education and training are far below standard and do not meet the requirement. Therefore, it would be wise to take those workers out of the list of request in the catalogue. In the professional category, architects and engineers and nurses and midwives would not find shortterm job through only physical presence like the semiskilled manpower. This is mainly because the curricula and training do not necessarily meet the requirement of the host countries and lack global accreditation. Conversely, Chartered and Cost and Management Accountants would easily be able to export services or even travel worldwide for shortterm physical presence due to their accreditation. Besides ICAB and ICMAB, some leading global accountants and auditing institutions, ACCA and CIMA, are now operating in Bangladesh, which has opened up opportunity for Bangladeshi professionals to export quality accounting and auditing services in Mode4 due to global recognition as professional manpower. Despite lack of international accreditation, the architecture and engineering services could be exported through attracting international investment in Bangladesh. If international firms are allowed to open offices in Bangladesh and recruit manpower from the country, they can export services by staying in the country and paying short visits abroad once or twice a , based on demand of the international clients. In that case, easing the financial rules of Bangladesh is imperative so that they are not exposed to difficulties in financial transactions, both inward and outward. It will be beneficial for Bangladesh in the long run.\",\n",

Japan, which has built friendly relations with ASEAN members and enjoys close trade and economic ties with the region, should provide effective support for the plan to help the group achieve better economic progress.

Its membership has now grown to 10 countries, including Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. The ASEAN members combined had gross domestic product reaching $2.4 trillion in 2013 making it the world seventh largest economy, even larger than Russia or India with percapita GDP reaching $3,837. The group 2013 growth rate hit 5.1 percent, and it is forecast that ASEAN as a single entity could become the world fourthlargest economy by 2050 if its growth trend continues. Its combined area is 12 times that of Japan and its total population is the world thirdlargest, following China and India. Its combined population surpasses either the European Union or the United States as a market. The group has the world thirdlargest labor force, and it is relatively young. These numbers graphically underscore ASEAN immense economic potential. Since the 1990s, ASEAN has worked to increase the region economic activities through tariff cuts and the elimination of nontariff barriers to trade, and its efforts for regional economic integration have culminated in the creation of the AEC. The socalled ASEAN6 Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei has already abolished tariffs on more than 99 percent of goods traded. Cambodia and the three other members will gradually reduce their tariffs with a view toward eventually abolishing them. Such efforts turned ASEAN into an highly open economic region, with international merchandise trade reaching $2.5 trillion in 2013 $1.3 trillion exports and $1.2 trillion imports. Trade among ASEAN members accounted for about a quarter of the total. ASEAN adopted the AEC Blueprint when it marked the 40th anniversary of its founding in 2007, moving up the schedule for the AEC establishment from 2020 to 2015, and implemented 80 percent of the measures included in the blueprint by 2013. But the group full economic integration won't be realized in the beginning. Although the AEC is aiming for the free flow of labor and services, progress in this field is slow. Unlike the EU, border controls between AEC memberstates will remain and they will continue to use their own national currencies. ASEAN members' political systems, religions and income levels differ greatly from each other. Promoting equitable economic development will be one of the challenges for ASEAN to tackle as it runs the AEC. At the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting held in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, in late January, the chairman statement underlined the members' strong political will to create the AEC by the end of this  as scheduled. It called on the member states to make efforts to ensure its successful launch. A major problem that ASEAN faces is China attempt to increase its maritime dominance in the South China Sea. China is engaged in disputes with some ASEAN members over islets and is seeking to establish effective rule over these territories. The chairman statement  that ASEAN will push for an early conclusion of the Code of Conduct with China, which will have binding power, to defuse tension in the area, but the goal remains difficult due to China intransigence. China should refrain from any attempt to bring the ASEAN economic zone into its sphere of influence through the use of political and military power. In contrast with China, there are no contentious issues between Japan and any of ASEAN members. Japan has for many  continued to invest in the region and provide it with economic assistance, and the high technological levels of Japanese firms and the quality of their products enjoy considerable respect in the region. Japan should deepen its relations with ASEAN by fully utilizing these advantages. It can also utilize the knowledge it has gained from its own economic growth to offer advice to ASEAN as it tries to narrow the gaps among members in social and economic development, and to improve the protection of intellectual property. The AEC can be a stepping stone toward deeper and wider regional integration in the form of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free trade agreement between ASEAN and the six countries with which it has existing FTAs Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India and possibly the establishment of an East Asian community. For the time being, Japan should help ASEAN by concentrating on providing support to solidify the AEC economic foundation in its initial stage.\",\n",
       " 'Shipping firms, dockers union reach tentative deal on US ports AFP, February 21, 2015 Los Angeles (AFP) US West Coast dockworkers and port operators have reached a tentative deal on a new labor contract, officials , averting a shutdown that would have hit about half the country trade. The tentative five agreement, details of which were not immediately available, should free up operations at the ports, with business \"restored to full capacity\" beginning Saturday evening, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez told a conference call. Operations had slowed significantly since the labor contract expired in July at key ports for trade with Asia. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), representing 20,000 dockworkers, still must approve the deal with the Pacific Maritime Association, representing management for all 29 West Coast ports. The union steering committee, however, was unanimous in its support. \"After more than nine months of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement that is good for workers and for the industry,\" PMA president James McKenna and ILWU president Bob McEllrath  in a joint statement. \"We are also pleased that our ports can now resume full operations.\" Perez oversaw four days of negotiations in San Francisco between the two parties. \"There were far too many victims across the country, and that why the president sent me here\" Perez  Friday. The labor secretary had warned the two sides to strike a deal for a new dockworker contract now or see talks move to Washington, which would place more federal pressure on the two parties. \\'A huge relief\\' The agreement is \"a huge relief for our economy particularly the countless American workers, farmers and businesses that have been affected by the dispute and those facing even greater disruption and costs with further delays,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest  in a statement. The president called on the two parties to tend to backlogs as they finalize the deal, Earnest added. The National Retail Federation hailed the agreement as well, saying \"it is now time for the parties to quickly ratify the deal and immediately focus on clearing out the crisislevel congestion and backlog at the ports.\" \"As we welcome today news, we must dedicate ourselves to finding a new way to ensure that this nightmare scenario is not repeated again,\" added the NRF, the world largest retail federation. Since October, the dockworkers have steadily slowed the processing of incoming and outgoing freight at ports that handle about half of the country trade. In response, the port owners have canceled shifts and had multipleday lockouts to deny the longshoremen holiday and overtime pay. The result has been a backup of billions of dollars\\' worth of cargo, with heavily laden container ships lined up outside ports from southern California to the border with Canada. Pressure grew on both sides to compromise over what has been for weeks the key remaining issue, the arbitration system for labor disputes on the docks. The ILWU sought more say on who can serve as an arbitrator, amid reports that the union claims the system has become more biased in favor of port management.',\n",

       " 'India to go slow on agricultural talks as US seeks tariff cuts The Times of India, By Dilasha Seth, 22 fvrier 2015, NEW DELHI: India is likely to go slow on agricultural talks with the US after Washington sought greater market access through tariff cuts for its apples, almonds, walnuts and whiskey. The import duties for these items are at the ceiling level, bound by India at the World Trade Organization. The video conference of the agriculture joint working group has been put on hold for the time being with India having very little to seek besides market access for grapes, which is a nontariff issue. There have been two video conference meetings for intellectual property rights and \\'investment in manufacturing\\' last month before the visit of US President Barack Obama. \"We are still evaluating if there should be a third video conferencing or not. On the agri side, there hardly anything we are seeking besides grapes. They, on the other hand, want tariff reduction on many items, which cannot be sorted out via bilateral video conferencing as import duties are not USspecific,\"  a government official. All these items have a ceiling duty, with walnuts at 100 per cent, fresh apples 50 per cent, and whiskey 150 per cent. Almonds have a specific duty of Rs 100 per kg. These duties make American agricultural products uncompetitive in the market. Of the $13.8 million worth of apple imports by India in 201314, only $0.05 million came from the US. A mere $0.14 million worth of almonds were imported from the US. India and the US formed three working groups during the trade policy forum (TPF) in November IPR, investment in manufacturing and agriculture. US assistant secretary of commerce Holly Vineyard is expected to visit New Delhi to discuss bilateral issues sometime in March. \"They have not mentioned the level to which they wolike a reduction, but have asked for a reduction in a gradual manner,\" he . Besides tariff reduction, US has also raised certain nontariff issues, seeking market access for poultry and pork. The two countries have already been battling out the poultry ban imposed by India in 2007 at the WTO. The multilateral organization in its October order had asked India to lift the ban on account of avian influenza, calling it \\'unscientific\\' and noncompliant with WTO rules, which New Delhi has appealed against. Besides, India does not allow pork or meat fed with meat, blood or bones. India has been seeking withdrawal of nontariff barriers for grapes as US can become a big market for India as it exports at a different time than the top grapes exporters such as Chile and South Africa. \"Potentially US can become a very big market for us as we have a natural advantage of producing grapes when others are not,\" he . India had has put in place all necessary sanitary and phytosanitary measures to ensure that quality of grapes match standards sought by US authorities.

In a notice posted on its website, the WTO  the Philippines would give a statement on Thailands customs and fiscal measures on cigarette imports from the Philippine during the meeting of the agencys Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) on Monday. The Trade department  earlier the Philippine government is giving Thailand time to address outstanding issues on its compliance to the WTO decision amid a change in the political leadership last . Thai army chief Prayuth ChanOcha who took control of the country in a coup that toppled the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, was named prime minister by the legislature in August last . Among the outstanding issues is Thailands compliance to the WTO ruling particularly is the decision of the Thai attorney general to prosecute an importer of Philippine cigarettes and several of its employees for alleged under declaration of customs values from 2003 to 2007. The Philippine government is asking its Thai counterparts to provide information on the matter to determine whether the customs transactions covered by the WTO ruling are also part of the case Thailand wants to prosecute. Trade Assistant secretary Ceferino Rodolfo  earlier that as the government waits for Thailands action on the outstanding issues, it would also want to ensure that Philippine export interests are not affected and gains from the WTO ruling continue to benefit exporters.

Ireland  in 2013 it wanted to become the first country in the European Union to ban branding on cigarette packages and reiterated its plans this week after the legislation prompted a threat of legal action from Japan Tobacco International . The minister who has designed the legislation, James Reilly,  Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco had written to his department and that one of the firms demanded he tell them in writing by this week that Dublin would not proceed with the law. \"This week I received letters from two of the largest tobacco companies in the world threatening legal action against this state,\" Reilly  in a speech at his Fine Gael party annual conference. \"I want to be crystal clear.

       " 'FTAs provide plentiful opportunities for agriculture Vietnam News Agency Bulletin, 22 fvrier 2015, Hanoi, February 22 (VNA) An array of free trade agreements (FTAs) coming into effect this  will open up a wide range of new blindingly bright opportunities for the agricultural sector leading to improved investment opportunities along the entire valuechain, reported The Voice of Vietnam (VOV). A more perplexing dilemma however, is determining the best business model and strategy to lift agriculture from the production of low value staple food commodities higher up the value chain to make the best of the opportunities. It was not by chance that the 45th World Economic Forum (WEF) held recently in Davos (Switzerland) placed the issue of food security for more than 7.2 billion people in the world to the forefront of its agenda. This fact clearly shows the increasingly  role that food producers and suppliers play and most notably highlight Vietnam?s critically  role in ensuring food security in the world. However, despite being one of the world?s leading agroforestryfishery exporters, Vietnam agriculture reveals weaknesses? low value products at cheap prices, inefficient use of land and natural resources, limited agricultural investment and poor hygiene and food safety. With the current status of productivity and quality of agricultural products, Vietnamese farmers and businesses are in a pickle to take advantage of the coming golden opportunities absent extensive investment and renovation. Thus, opportunities could be missed and leave Vietnam stagnant, producing low value commodities. Investors from the Republic of Korea, Australia and Japan are actively looking for favourable investment opportunities and have embarked on a number of land lease projects for production, processing and exports in Vietnam. If Vietnamese farmers are off the mark in negotiating these agreements they could find themselves simply working as farm labour for foreign investors, or in other words? they will just be employees on their soil. In the face of limited agricultural investment, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in agriculture are invaluable. Therefore it is critically  that these agreements be structured in a manner that enables local farmers and agro businesses to team up with foreign investors on an equal partnership basis. On a positive note, in recent times, a series of big enterprises across many fields have shifted their investment in the agricultural sector to largescale agricultural projects based on hightech models which have brought higher efficiency. The expanding capital inflows into the agricultural sector show that sufficient resources to restructure the sector are available? it?s just a matter of sitting down at the negotiating table and working out the details. To this end however, businesses need the support of the government and more incentives to help entice foreign investors to fund land and infrastructure purchases as well as acquire the necessary technologies to revamp the agriculture sector. To call for more agricultural investment, the Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has been working hand in hand with multinational groups to implement the public?privatepartnership (PPP) model. Additionally, the MARD, last , drafted a strategy for attracting FDI in the agro forestry fisheries sector until 2030 for submission to the Prime Minister for approval. Agriculture is the biggest advantage of Vietnam?s economy and it logically follows therefore that agricultural restructuring is crucially  in negotiating free trade agreements. Restructuring is seen as a monumental opportunity that will benefit the whole national economy. Successful restructuring will not only enable Vietnam to become an agricultural power, but also serve as a promoter of the industry and service sectors in furtherance of transforming into an industrialised and modern nation by 2020./.',\n",
       " 'ASEAN set to declare a unified common market India Today, 21 fvrier 2015, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) looks set to declare a unified common market by December 31, 2015. This concept is derived from the European Union style of economic integration which experts say will be difficult to achieve. Efforts are being made to reduce trade barriers and open floodgates for easy investments as well as the free flow of goods, services, products and skilled labour across nations. Meanwhile, top leaders of nations like Indonesia and Malaysia in recent weeks have been pushing for the unification of time zone as opposed to the current system of three different zones spanning over the ASEAN region. A single time zone would reduce the technicalities of doing business within the southeast Asian region and would help in coordinated opening and closing time for stock markets and banks promoting overall inclusive growth among the southeast Asian nations. Some experts have serious doubts about the formation and success of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) as it seeks to unify economies who are developing and evolving at vastly different rates and are on different stages of progress as per there gross domestic products. Other than this ASEAN nations have distinct cultures, values, languages, currencies and a history of political mistrust. Yet many see an upcoming power house in the making with a population of around 625 million which is much more larger than the European Union or North America being the third largest labour resource in the world only behind China and India and a ever expanding consumer class. ASEAN already is referred to as Asia third pillar of growth and development after China and India. When taken together as an integrated regional economic force, the member states of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) form the World seventh largest economy. Which is behind the US, China, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom and lies ahead of India, Brazil and Russia. The formation of AEC marks a major milestone in the development and progress of southeast asian nations. As it will open up new opportunities for trade and business in this part of the world by providing a platform for economic liberalization but many leading economists see the AEC as nothing but a paper tiger and point to obstacles in unifying the various economies like economic nationalism and resistance to foreignowned industries in the member countries like Indonesia and South China Sea maritime disputes that could create an unhealthy environment and hamper regional cooperation. The ASEAN Economic Community is largely about business participation and economic cooperation in this singular market but all the statistical surveys and analysis done till now suggests low awareness and even lower preparedness. Planned efforts are required to be made to integrate the concept of ASEAN nations and to make the ASEAN Economic Community united under a single time zone. Eventually if efforts are made in the right direction ASEAN may integrate into a truly border less economic community united by a single time zone and a unified approach of holistic development for all the member nations of the community. Important facts about the ASEAN Community: The ASEAN refers to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It was established onAugust 8, 1967in Bangkok under the pact known as theBangkok declaration. Its charter was released on December 16, 2008. The working language of ASEAN is English. It has 10 member states and 2 observers. The member states are listed as Brunei,Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Phillippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The two observers currently are Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea.The headquarters of the organization are situated in Manila, Philippiness and the motto of ASEAN Community is\"One Vision, One Identity, One Community.\"',\n",

The first and second editions of such conference were held in Mexico Monterrey and Qatar Doha respectively, and the upcoming conference on financing for development (EFD) will be convened from July 13 to 16 in Addis Ababa, capital of the East African nation. The conference is expected to build on the previous two conferences and to agree the next international statement of how development should be resourced in the post2015 period, as the internationally agreed millennium development goals (MDGs) come to an end this . Having started preparations, Ethiopia is working very hard to successfully host the conference in a coordinated manner in all aspects of the fourday international event, according to the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Abraham Tekeste, Ethiopia State Minister of Finance and Economic Development, told reporters on Friday at a press conference that a national interministerial committee has been established to oversee the overall organization of the conference. Having established other two subcommittees, Ethiopia has been closely working with the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union, as well as other regional and international institutions towards the success of the event, according to the minister. He noted that the conference is expected to agree on how to finance sustainable development in the post2015 period. \"Ethiopia is hosting this conference as this conference is critical for deciding how sustainable development should be resourced in the post2015 period, and the means of implementation for Sustainable Development Goals,\" the minister . Ethiopia wants to use the conference to showcase its success to the world on its experience in financing its rapid and sustainable growth, industrialization drive and infrastructure development, according to the minister.

The conference is expected to bring together highlevel political representatives including heads of states, ministers and senior officials of finance, foreign affairs and development cooperation, as well as relevant institutional stakeholders, private sector, philanthropy, nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations. Mexico hosted the first of such meeting in 2002, which resulted in the Monterrey Consensus that established a broad foundation for financing for development taking into account mobilization of domestic resources, foreign direct investment, official development assistance, trade, debt and systematic issues. The follow up conference was in Qatar Doha in 2008 with update including statements on responding to the financial crisis, climate change and volatile markets, and acknowledged the particular challenges faced by lower middle income countries as well as conflict affected countries.',\n",
       " '\\'Protectionist\\' French law alarms investors Financial Times (FT.Com) , By Steve Johnson , 22 fvrier 2015 07:39, A group of large investors has written to France biggest companies asking them to opt out of a controversial new \"protectionist\" law. Under the Florange law, passed in April, investors that have held stock in a listed French company for at least two  will automatically be granted double voting rights unless the company alters its articles of association to opt out of this provision. The legislation reverses the current position whereby companies had to expressly choose to introduce double voting rights. Some investors fear it will strengthen the hand of the French state, which has large holdings in many French companies, as well as trade unions, which typically control the voting rights of employee share schemes, at the expense of minority shareholders. \"The government is effectively changing the law to create an enhanced share class to protect France so it can influence the way France is governed,\"  Neil Dwane, chief investment officer for European equities at Allianz Global Investors. It is among 19 investors with combined assets of 2.3tn that have written to the chief executives of France 40 largest companies arguing in favour of \"one share, one vote\". Angeli Benham, corporate governance manager at Legal & General Investment Management, which has written its own letter to almost 100 French companies, : \"It is a form of protectionism. In France there are a lot of government or familyowned companies and they are not really interested in what minority shareholders have to say.\" Ms Benham  LGIM had so far received just two responses, including one from a CAC 40 company with a large government stake that  it had no plans to opt out. The campaign comes just weeks after a successful investor rebellion in Italy against a new law that would have made it easier for companies to create \"loyalty shares\" offering double voting rights to longterm investors. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi agreed to scrap a law allowing loyalty shares to be created if approved by a simple 50 per cent majority of shareholders, rather than the previous twothirds majority, amid claims from investors, academics and board members that the watering down would benefit entrenched family shareholders. Mr Dwane  French companies that moved away from one share, one vote risked driving away foreign investment, raising their cost of capital. \"This kind of behaviour will detract from the willingness to invest in France. French companies will trade at a discount because people feel there is a higher burden of care required because of the interference from the French government. I think it is  that all shareholders are treated equally,\" he . Ms Benham  LGIM, which holds just under 1 per cent of the French market through its index funds, was unable to register for double voting rights because the stock is held in nominee accounts. Karina Litvack, a nonexecutive director at Eni, the energy company, and former head of governance and sustainable investments at F&C Asset Management, who was influential in forcing the policy Uturn in Italy,  \"the administrative hoops required to qualify for loyalty shares are so unwieldy that, in effect, their only beneficiaries are controlling shareholders\". The Florange law also scraps the principle of board neutrality during offer periods, giving boards discretion to take frustrating measures without prior shareholder approval. It was introduced after ArcelorMittal, the Luxembourgbased steelmaker, defied the French government by closing two furnaces in the northeastern French town of Florange. Other signatories to the French letter include Aberdeen, Robeco, PGGM and TIAACREF. The French economy ministry  the measure was designed to promote longterm investment, reduce stock turnover and \"allow companies to be managed in a longterm perspective\", and that it was not protectionist because all longterm shareholders, regardless of their nationality, qualified for double voting rights. It estimated that 22 constituents of the Cac 40 already have double votingright mechanisms in place, while similar systems existed in several other European countries. \"The double voting rights mechanism is not mandatory. The shareholders who oppose it are free to vote against it,\" the ministry added. END',\n",

In a speech delivered at the WTO Feb. 20 General Council meeting in Geneva, Azevedo also commended members for a “productive start” in their recent discussions regarding agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services and urged them to “intensify” their work to produce a detailed postBali work program by July 31. Specifically, he urged members to “identify more clearly the problems and challenges ahead of us” and “explore potential solutions for each of those problems and challenges.” Azevedo stressed the narrowing timeline between now and the July 31 deadline and  that the negotiations “still have a long distance to travel.” No Consensus Members agreed that consensus on some of the most difficult issues of the Doha Round—like agricultural domestic support and market access—remain elusive, in separate comments delivered at the meeting. The U.S.  that members are “nowhere near consensus” on “what a work program should look like, or how it could realistically enable us to conclude the round in a manner that works for everyone, and that can be accomplished in a relatively rapid timeframe.” China Ambassador Yu Jianhua  that it is “true that we have not seen any substantial results, but we have a better understanding of each other concerns, particularly the ‘red lines’\\u2009” where members cannot agree. India  that members should embrace an appropriate level of ambition regarding the agricultural negotiations and seek an equitable balance with developmentoriented outcomes. Several WTO members noted that the amount of work required may extend the work program negotiations past July and into December, when members meet in Nairobi, Kenya, for the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference. Agriculture Negotiations “There has been a good level of attendance and engagement at these consultations which has highlighted the growing realization among members that the key issues need to be tackled in a detailed and concrete way,” Azevedo . Azevedo comments echoed those of John Adank, the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee in Special Session, who recently called on members to tackle the key issues of market access, export subsidies and public stockholding for food security purposes in a more “detailed and concrete way.” Adank  that the recent discussions have “highlighted some significant divergences about the present day viability” of the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4), according to a Feb. 19 report (34 WTO, 2/20/15). Modalities are formulas for various outcomes, including reducing tariffs and tradedistorting remedies, last revised in 2008. “Some members continue to state that the 2008 draft modalities reflected the maximum possible ambition for agricultural market access given their domestic sensitivities,” the report . “Others have stressed that the 2008 draft modalities would not provide commercially meaningful new market access given the flexibilities embedded in it and thus an outcome based on these draft modalities would fall short of their market access goals.” Adank will convene an informal meeting “in the near future,” and members of the WTO Agriculture Committee will meet on March 4 and 5. ‘Blood for Water.’ Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke  that the U.S. would not support a scenario whereby it would agree to make cuts to its domestic support programs while countries like India and China “make no meaningful contribution,” according to a transcript of his speech at the General Council meeting. “We view that as blood for water—or, blood for air—which is simply not an outcome that we could endorse,” Punke . Punke comments refer to a recent paper that detailed how key WTO members—the U.S., Brazil, India, China, Japan and Australia—would be affected if they adjusted their present domestic support levels according to the Rev. 4 proposal. The paper found that only the U.S. would have to adjust its domestic support levels to achieve compliance under the Rev. 4 proposal. Such a scenario makes little sense for the U.S. when India and China are now the top two users of tradedistorting agricultural subsidies,  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in a Jan. 22 blog post. “In our view, we must continue to recalibrate,” Punke . “We are collectively better positioned than we were a few weeks ago to really start tackling the question of what recalibration means.” ‘Big, Rich Farmers.’ The Chinese ambassador  that members should recognize the stark differences in how domestic subsidies are applied in different countries. “We should not mislead the discussions by mixing up the support of different natures, of different histories, of different size in terms of per capita and for different purposes,” Ambassador Yu . “We should be honest to look at whether the support is provided to big, rich farmers for their export, commercial interests, or for the food security and livelihood of hundreds of millions of small and poor farmers; whether these are the measures to actively distort the market or to offset the impact of [a] distorted international market.” “For the next steps, we believe that members should build upon the discussions in the past few weeks and engage in more substantive and solutionoriented deliberations on the basis of 2008 modality texts,” Yu . “Recalibration must be done in a nondiscriminatory way, that is, if some members' obligations are readjusted, then obligations of other members should also be readjusted accordingly,” he . “Only winwin solutions could survive.” “If we throw away all we have achieved in the past and start from scratch, we are going nowhere,” he . “If we choose an uncharted route, we are going nowhere. Neither of these would make our life easier at all.” ‘Differentiation.’ Punke clarified the U.S. position towards “differentiation” in the roles and contributions of developing country members within the context of the ongoing trade negotiations. What the U.S. means by differentiation is that “a developing country member that today maintains very significant agricultural domestic support programs and has the productive capacity to affect global markets will necessarily have to participate in negotiations, and contribute to outcomes, in ways that are different than developing countries that don't have such programs,” Punke . “Such developing countries are different from other developing countries, and we cannot succeed if we pretend otherwise.” “We do not mean that we are seeking a new categorization of members within the WTO. We are not talking about ‘graduation,'\\u2009” Punke . “None of this requires any revision of categories within this institution, but it does implicate the need for a flexible approach that recognizes that there can be no onesizefitsall approach for development.” Members are generally moving into “interesting and at least somewhat encouraging new territory,” Punke . The past few weeks of trade negotiations mark “a relatively productive period in our development of a postBali work program” for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), Punke . “Compared to the work we did last , we now are aiming much more directly at substance, tackling hard issues, and engaging in meaningful, if difficult, exchanges,” he . Market Access Negotiations More “concrete proposals” are required for members to achieve progress in the negotiations regarding market access, Azevedo told members. “The consultations have shown that work should mainly focus on the socalled ‘formulaapplying members,' in a first stage,” he . The chairman of the negotiating group on market access, Remigi Winzap of Switzerland,  that the current discussions are determined by four different elements, according to a report circulated among members. “The first one is the level of ambition of a) negotiations in the WTO in today international trading environment and b) in other WTO negotiating areas, in particular in agriculture,” the report . “The second determinant, which is linked to the first one, is what members can give and what specific NAMA (nonagriculture market access) aspirations they are pursuing in respect of binding coverage, reducing binding overhang and acquiring real market access,” it . “The third, and very difficult, element in the equation for finding a NAMA outcome are the very different tariff profiles of members,” the report . “The difficulty being that whatever approach is chosen, it could have quite different implications for members.” “The fourth component which is  to many members is how to take into consideration in a NAMA outcome potential concessions which would be granted on an MFN (mostfavored nation)basis on NAMAproducts in plurilateral negotiations like the ongoing ITA (Information Technology Agreement) expansion negotiation,” the report  Members of the Negotiating Group on Market Access plan to meet on March 2 to further discuss these issues, Azevedo . New Chair Announcements Members elected Mexican Ambassador Fernando de Mateo to replace Jonathan Fried as the next chair of the General Council. Ambassador Harald Neple of Norway becomes the chairman of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), the position formerly held by de Mateo. Members agreed to the following list of chair assignments: Trade Policy Review Body Chairman, Atanas Atanassov Paparizov of Bulgaria; Council for Trade in Goods Chairman, Hector Casanueva of Chile; Council for Trade in Services Chairman, Martin Eyjolfsson of Iceland; Council for TRIPS Chairman, Abdolazeez AlOtaibi of Saudi Arabia; Committee on Trade and Development Chairman, Bassirou Sene of Senegal; Committee on BalanceofPayments Restrictions Chairman, Bertrand de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele of Belgium; Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration Chairman, Daniel Blockert of Sweden; Committee on Trade and Environment Chairwoman, Irene B.K.

       " \"WTO Week Ahead: Members to Discuss Ongoing Trade Disputes, TRIPS Agreement By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 23, 2015 Feb. 20 — World Trade Organization members will discuss a number of ongoing trade disputes and review the work of the TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council in separate meetings. On Feb. 23, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) meeting will discuss, among other items, a European Union panel request to investigate U.S. domestic subsidies to manufacture Boeing aircraft parts. Last , the EU criticized U.S. officials for offering billions of dollars in tax subsidies in 2013 aimed at encouraging Boeing to manufacture its 777X commercial aircraft parts in Washington state (245 WTO, 12/22/14). The panel request marks the latest salvo in the longsimmering dispute between the EU and U.S. over their respective tax regimes regarding aerospace manufacturing. PET, Pulp and Steel The DSB will also consider Pakistan dispute with the EU over imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products. Pakistan asked the DSB to determine whether the EU unfairly characterized the country domestic tax laws when it imposed countervailing measures on Pakistani PET products. The EU in 2010 issued a decision to assign a 5.1 percent countervailing duty rate on imports of certain PET products from Pakistan, such as plastic food and beverage containers. The EU  that Pakistan had implemented at least seven forms of domestic subsidies, favorable tax regimes and tariff protections that unfairly harmed the EU PET industry. The DSB will consider Canada request for a panel investigation of China antidumping duties on imports of cellulose pulp from Canada. The parties failed to reach an agreement on the dispute after it was first initiated Oct. 15, 2014. Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) requested a DSB panel investigation of its dispute with Canada regarding antidumping measures related to imports of certain carbon steel welded pipe originating from Taiwan. Taiwan initially requested consultations with Canada to resolve the matter on June 25, 2014. TRIPS Review On Feb. 23, the TRIPS Special Session Committee will review its ongoing work to create a multilateral system for notifying and registering geographical indications for wine and spirits. The committee work has largely stalled since 2011, with just three committee meetings being held since then. During the committee last meeting in December 2014, members  that they are committed to meeting the July 31 deadline for advancing a work program to complete the Doha Round. The geographical indications register for wines and spirits is the only intellectual property subject officially in the Doha Round. The meetings are considered special sessions of the TRIPS Council. Tobacco Labeling Dispute The TRIPS Council will hold regular meetings Feb. 24–25 to discuss proposals by the United Kingdom and Ireland to implement rules regarding plain packaging of tobacco products. The Dominican Republic plans to express its concerns that the U.K. and Ireland are considering a proposal that requires mandatory colors for tobacco packaging—dull brown for the outside, white for the inside—and permits only specified text, such as the brand and type (22 WTO, 2/3/15). The Dominican Republic and four other WTO members—Ukraine, Honduras, Indonesia and Cuba—are embroiled in an ongoing legal challenge against Australia 2011 Tobacco Plain Packaging Act and are worried that more countries will seek to restrict how tobacco manufacturers label cigarette packaging. The countries argue that such laws impose unfair restrictions on the use of trademarks, geographical indications and other markings in violation of the TRIPS agreement, the agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. New Zealand and France also have considered implementing such rules as a means to reduce smoking. The U.S. is not directly involved in the complaint but has reserved its right to participate as a third party. Other Meetings On Feb. 24, there will be an informal meeting regarding the WTO services negotiations related to members' goal of concluding the Doha Round of trade negotiations. On Feb. 26, there will be an informal meeting of the WTO negotiating group on rules.\",\n",

       " 'India wheat subsidies illegal under WTO pledge: US industry From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) America wheat industry has accused India of offering export subsidies to its farmers which are illegal under its WTO pledge, saying countries like China and India have far exceeded their WTO commitments on key commodities resulting in serious trade distortions. \"Increasing support levels gave India farmers an artificial incentive to produce more wheat. In fact, India wheat production increased by 35 per cent over those seven  (200506 to 201314) to record levels. That buoyed world wheat supplies and increased pressure on prices that hurt wheat farmers in other countries,\" the US Wheat Associates  in a media release. Referring to a recent study by Washingtonbased DTB Associates, it  India minimum support price for wheat increased by 111 per cent between 200506 and 201314. India recently notified the WTO of a much lower increase but the study showed that the India government used faulty tactics to calculate the number it reported, a number that many other WTO members have questioned, it alleged. Over the same time, India wheat exports increased from 300,000 metric tons (MT) to 6.5 million MT, the release . \"The study also included evidence that India is offering wheat export subsidies that are also illegal under its WTO commitment,\" it claimed. \"Yet, claiming it must maintain a large public stockpile of grain to maintain food security as an advanced developing country, India has demanded exemptions to its tradedistorting levels of support,\" it . \"We agree with our US agricultural negotiators that we see no possibility of concluding the Doha agreement by pursuing the same approach used over the last decade,\"  USW vice president of Policy Shannon Schlecht. \"Hopefully the facts in the study will help raise awareness of the current realities of tradedistorting farm subsidies. Without this information it will be impossible for WTO members to achieve a balanced Doha Round conclusion across the domestic support, market access and export competition pillars,\" Schlecht . The study claims that the governments of India, China, Turkey, Brazil and Thailand have dramatically increased trade distorting subsidies for wheat, corn or rice production over the past 10  to levels that exceed their WTO agreements. \"US wheat farmers strongly support the goals of the WTO and the Doha Round,\"  USW president Alan Tracy. \"We also believe every WTO member must follow the rules. Sadly, the facts we have uncovered show this is not the case.\" Member countries are required to report their domestic support levels to WTO regularly, but more than 650 notifications were late as of November 2014, Tracy noted. China has not reported since 2008 and India just submitted a notification last fall covering seven crop  to make them current through 2010.

       " 'MCFL, 2 others seek subsidy for urea plants beyond Apr 16 New Delhi, Feb 22 (PTI) Vijay Mallyaled MCFL and two other fertiliser firms have demanded that government should continue paying subsidies to their napthabased urea plants beyond the April 16 deadline as these factories have not yet been connected with gas pipeline. On January 7 this , the Centre decided to give subsidy to these three urea plants, which uses naptha as feedstock, for the next 100 days to restart these facilities which were closed since October, 2014. The government had asked these companies to convert their plants into gasbased, but in absence of gasconnectivity these plants are forced to run on costlier naptha. \"We have requested the government to allow us to operate beyond 100 days as we have not been provided the connectivity to gas pipeline so far,\" Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (MCFL) Managing Director Deepak Anand told PTI. Madras Fertilizers and SPIC have also made similar requests to the fertiliser ministry. In a letter to Fertiliser Minister Ananth Kumar, SPIC has sought extension of the deadline, saying that this would not result into additional subsidy burden on the exchequer. \"Naphtha based plants would be paid subsidy on the basis average of spot RLNG or Naphtha whichever is lower.

China was one of the world fastestgrowing dairy markets, but consumption there has dried up after earlier high prices cut domestic demand, leaving excess stocks of imported milk powder. \"It might be another six months before it (the outlook) improves,\"  Susan Kilsby, dairy analyst at NZX Agri, noting there should be a seasonal rise in milk production in the European Union, the United States and China in the spring. \"I don\\'t think it (the rise in production) is going to be massive because prices are so low there isn\\'t that incentive there but ... there will certainly be enough supply to keep prices low, at least until the middle of the .\" China has also seen heavy investment in higheryielding modern dairy farms with smaller dairy farmers dumping milk and selling cows as demand from processors slows. \"We don\\'t see China coming back to the global market in a big way until the second half (of 2015),\"  Rabobank analyst Sandy Chen. \"Some major players have indicated that they won\\'t go to the international market at all this . Their large suppliers ie the large farms are still increasing production ... so they will continue to source milk domestically.\" The sharp decline in prices coincides with plans by some EU farmers to expand production in the runup to the abolition of milk quotas in April. A food embargo by Russia has also cut off the EU biggest outlet for cheese, worth almost one billion euros in 2013, and accelerated a decline in EU milk prices from a record high at the end of 2013. \"We were very dependent on Russia for cheese exports, hence the current turbulence on the market but you have to separate microtrends from big, longterm ones,\"  Pierre Begoc, international director at French consultancy Agritel. \"Northern Europe is the zone with the biggest potential worldwide to raise production,\" he added, noting New Zealand had less capacity to boost output. CURRENCY SWINGS HELP SOME Producers in countries such as the United States where the main focus is to meet domestic demand were initially shielded to some extent from the fall in international prices but the impact is now beginning to be felt, analysts . \"Global market forces driving the lower milk prices have flowed through to virtually every dairy farmer in the world, whereas six months ago it was only New Zealand farmers who were in that situation,\" Kilsby . Jerry Dryer of U.S.based Dairy and Food Market Analyst  there had been a sharp drop in U.S. prices from previous record levels but buyers were now beginning to replenish inventories. This is now providing some support for prices in the U.S. cash market although exports were challenging, he . \"Our prices have been a little higher than New Zealand recently, which makes it difficult to export,\" he . Weak local currencies have, however, provided some protection for producers in Australia, the world fourth largest exporter, and in the European Union. \"While the global price of milk is down 50 percent, our price to our consumers is down only 12 percent,\"  Garry Helou, managing director of Murray Goulburn, Australia largest dairy producer. He added strong domestic demand had also allowed processors to switch to producing products such as cheese at the expense of milk powder. The huge swing in dairy prices during the last 12 months has led to some calls for the development of more futures markets to help farmers cope with volatility. Exchange operator Euronext  last month it would launch revamped dairy futures and options contracts by the end of March. And Britain government is supporting a feasibility study for dairy futures.

       " \"WTO Panel to Investigate EU Complaint About U.S. Aircraft Tax Incentives to Boeing By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 24, 2015 Feb. 23 — The World Trade Organization will investigate whether the U.S. violated its international obligations in offering tax incentives to encourage the Boeing Co. to manufacture its 777X commercial aircraft in Washington state. WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) agreed Feb. 23 to study the European Union claims that in 2013 the U.S. offered $8.7 billion in tax subsidies to Boeing in violation of its obligations under Sections 1 and 2 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The U.S.  it was disappointed the EU sought a panel investigation and claimed the tax measures “are fully consistent with U.S. obligations under the relevant WTO agreements.” The settlement body plans to issue a report within 90 days of the panel composition. Separate Review The U.S. rejected EU pleas to incorporate the dispute into the ongoing WTO investigations of the two members' respective aircraft manufacturing tax regimes. In 2012, the WTO ruled that U.S. tax subsidies for Boeing stemming back to 2005 violated international obligations and required the U.S. to amend its tax incentives to maintain compliance with WTO agreements (57 WTO, 3/26/12). The EU contested whether the U.S. complied with the WTO 2012 decision and initiated an investigation that is not expected to conclude until mid2015 at the earliest. Separately, the U.S. won a 2011 WTO dispute that claimed EU member states had offered illegal government subsidies to the European aircraft consortium, Airbus Group NV. The U.S. subsequently sought a compliance panel to determine whether the EU had failed to comply with the 2011 WTO decision (63 WTO, 4/1/11). The EU  it had secured repayment of some $2.3 billion in launchaid loans and had terminated the loan agreements in question. The decision in that case is not expected until the end of 2015. ‘Massive Disadvantage.’ The EU claimed that the 2013 U.S. tax incentives to Boeing already had been deemed to be illegal in 2012 and created “a massive disadvantage to the European aircraft industry,” according to its statement at the Feb. 23 meeting. The EU  the latest subsidies scheme favors U.S. goods by ensuring the tax benefits required Boeing to establish its 777X wing production and assembly in Washington state. Members requesting thirdparty rights in this request included Brazil, the Russian Federation, Japan, India, China and Korea. Other Panels The settlement body considered three other requests for dispute resolution panels at the Feb. 23 meeting. The first was Pakistan dispute with the EU over imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products. Pakistan claimed the EU unfairly characterized the country domestic tax laws when it imposed countervailing measures on Pakistani PET products. The second was Canada request for a panel investigation of China antidumping duties on imports of cellulose pulp from Canada.

The President of the the Bosnian parliament commission for foreign trade and customs, Semsudin Mehmedovic, told Balkan Insight that Bosnia is in the final phase of preparing to join the World Trade Organization, WTO, which will bring benefits in international trade. “For Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a member state, it has to reach bilateral agreements with two more countries,” he . While declining to name these countries, he added: “I expect our team to close this up until the end of the .” Mehmedovic  membership of the WTO would send a message to foreign investors that there is order and legal security in Bosnia and their money would be safe. “The market to which Bosnia and Herzegovina would sell its products would be expanded. We are a country that imports a lot from overseas countries,” he , “We have products to offer them, too. Bosnia and Herzegovina has this potential.” Bosnia currently has \"observer\" status in the WTO. It applied for membership in 1999 and presented its memorandum covering all aspects of its trade and legal regime in 2002. So far, 12 meetings of the Working Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina have taken place while the country has concluded bilateral negotiations with all but two member states. Duljko Hasic, an economist from the Bosnian Foreign Trade Chamber, told Balkan Insight that WTO membership would open up new trade possibilities as well as improving chances of eventual membership of the European Union. “It would mean a lot in terms of global trade exchange. It would represent a good move for Bosnia and Herzegovina economy,” he , noting that the country needed to fulfill all conditions for export under current agreements, such as the Central European Free Trade Agreement, CEFTA, or the existing trade agreement it has with the EU. “Membership in the WTO would create space to attract foreign investors,” Hasic added. Azra Hadziahmetovic, an economics professor from Sarajevo,  that Bosnia had already been applying some of the WTO rules through agreements such as CEFTA. She stressed that, as a WTO member, while Bosnia would receive benefits, they might be limited because Bosnia exports mostly to the countries in the region, not to the EU. Of the countries in the Southeast European region, only Bosnia and Serbia are still not WTO members but have observer status.

The regulation, which would come into force on Jan. 1, 2017, requires companies that sell smartphones and tablets in the fastgrowing economy of 250 million people to produce 40 percent of their content locally. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), America chief trade negotiator,  it was raising the issue with the Indonesian authorities and in multinational forums. Critics of the \"made in Indonesia\" rule, including an influential U.S. business group, say it could increase costs and restrict access to technology. \"The United States shares these concerns, and strongly supports ensuring that information and communications technology, which can be instrumental to economic development, be openly available in Indonesia,\"  a USTR spokesman in Washington. Less than a third of Indonesians own a smartphone, a much lower rate than China almost 80 percent, according to figures from research firm Canalys, making the country a highly attractive market for companies such as Apple Inc and South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung has already begun producing phones in Indonesia after opening a factory near Jakarta last . Apple’s supplier Foxconn, whose flagship listed unit is Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd, has been dragging its feet as it negotiates with the Indonesian government over a proposed investment that would include manufacturing smartphones. Apple and Samsung did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the localcontent rule. Indonesia Communications Minister Rudiantara, who is working on the regulation that is due to be finalised by March, could not reached for comment. Rudiantara told Reuters in January that the regulation would help Indonesia get a share of the roughly $4 billion in annual domestic smartphone sales and support President Joko Widodo pledge to switch the country from an economy that mainly consumes products, to one that produces them. The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) raised concerns about the rule in a Feb. 12 letter to Rudiantara. \"We fear that the approach taken in this draft regulation could inadvertently restrict access to new technologies, raise the cost of ICT for Indonesian companies, stimulate grey and black markets for mobile phones, and carry other unintended consequences,\" AmCham  in the letter, seen by Reuters. Before last  Indonesia fledging electronics industry had no smartphone manufacturing. \"One big concern of many companies, and not just American companies, has been that Indonesia lacks the supply chain to produce high quality mobile phones,\" Lin Neumann, the head of the Indonesian branch of AmCham, told Reuters. The letter to Rudiantara also warned the rule could contravene international trade law governed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). \"The policy of forced localization of manufacturing activities could have implications in terms of Indonesia WTO obligations,\" the letter .

       " 'Govt to form taskforce to safeguard domestic steel industry Tama Salim, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta 24 February 2015 The Jakarta Post After imposing safeguard duties on imported construction steel early this month, the government plans to form a task force to draft and evaluate policies to further provide protection for a flailing industry. According to Industry Minister Saleh Husin, the government will hold further discussions on strategies for empowering the domestic steel industry this week. One item up for discussion, Saleh , was the likely imposition of a 15 percent import tariff on construction steel, which is hoped to help curb the sharp rise in shipments into the local market. \"We will form a team to formulate some policy strategies, including a 15 percent import tariff. An evaluation into this is necessary to allow the domestic market to flourish,\" the minister told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting at the Office of the Coordinating Economic Minister in Jakarta on Friday. \"Our steel industry is currently somewhat ailing, so we must act firmly in order to keep it competitive.\" According to data from the Investment Coordinating Board (BPKM), the steel industry is still highly dependent on raw material imports such as sponge iron, pig iron and pellets, all of which are almost entirely sourced from overseas. This has resulted in a negative contribution of US$8.9 billion to the trade balance in 2013, making the steel industry one of the main culprits in the country current account deficit. Meanwhile, the ministry director general for manufacturing industries, Harjanto,  the proposed import tariff was geared toward safeguarding the steel industry, with the expectation that such measures would ensure the development of both upstream and downstream sectors in the country. \"We want to safeguard the domestic industry, but also keep within the corridors of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. Even other countries have higher safeguard duties,\" he told The Jakarta Post on Friday. Despite such measures, Harjanto warned businesses not to take it as a mandate to profiteer through price hikes. \"We need to introduce policies that not only protect the upstream cycle, but also the downstream industries. Safeguarding measures like this shouldn\\'t be taken for granted as an opportunity to raise prices, as that would obstruct other national projects,\" he . Harjanto  the government expected the tariff to boost the utilization of local steel production and processing industries. \"We have our maritime axis plan and other projects in the pipeline. What we plan to achieve [with the tariff] is for imports to remain competitive with the domestic industry,\" he explained. The president director of stateowned steel giant PT Krakatau Steel Tbk (KRAS), Irvan Kamal Hakim, who was also present at the meeting, welcomed the government commitment to safeguard the steel industry. He , however, that the state should have instead focused on boosting the industry competitiveness. \"Until today, Indonesia enforces one of the lowest import duties in the region, making us a lucrative market for other countries. Malaysia import duties currently stand at 20 percent and it has even imposed an additional 24 percent antidumping duty on Indonesian steel,\" Irvan . \"We don\\'t need protectionism; we just want to have a level playing field.\" Previously, the government imposed a three safeguard duty that would affect Ishaped and Hshaped steel sections imported from China, South Korea and Singapore. An investigation conducted by the Indonesian Trade Security Committee (KPPI) had found that imports of Ishaped and Hshaped steel surged significantly from a low level of 20,331 tons in 2010 to 395,814 in 2013. These products will be charged at 28 percent of their prices this  and lowered to 26 percent and 18 percent in subsequent  until Jan. 20, 2018. The safeguard measure is a procedure under the WTO that permits a government to act against an unusual increase in imports of similar goods from trading partners.',\n",
       " 'S. Korea seeks to boost rice exports amid possible oversupply SEJONG, Feb. 24 (Yonhap) South Korea will work to increase its exports of rice, the government  Tuesday, as a way of developing the local industry while also protecting the sector that now facing a possible oversupply. To help assist local producers and exporters, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has published an exporters handbook that outlines the names and other information of major buyers in key importing countries, including Australia and Japan. The handbook also contains customs and other market information, such as labeling regulations, of key markets, according to the ministry. The move comes as the country continues to face a possible oversupply of rice as its own output gained 0.3 percent on to about 4.23 million tons last  while its per capita consumption of the staple crop continues to drop. In 2014, the country annual intake of rice per person slipped 3.1 percent on to a record low of 65.1 kilograms. The figure marks a 52 percent plunge from the record high of 136.4 kg posted in 1970. South Korea has also liberalized its rice market with tarrification at the beginning of the , though imports under tarrification are currently subject to a tariff of 513 percent. The 513 percent tariff rate still requires verification by the World Trade Organization (WTO) while the country is required to import 408,700 tons of rice each  under a special arrangement with the WTO known as the minimum market access (MMA). All 408,700 tons of imports under MMA are only subject to a tariff rate of 5 percent, keeping their prices significantly lower than those of locally produced crops. \"Locally produced rice may appear to have little competitiveness in terms of price, especially in the global market, but its quality finds little competition anywhere in the world,\"  Kang Hyeyoung, head of the ministry export promotion division. In 2014, South Korea exported 1,992 tons of rice, worth $4.72 million, to 45 countries throughout the world. The amount marks a 13.6 percent on spike from 1,754 tons in 2013. The country also shipped about $59.5 million worth of rice products, such as rice cake, last , up 14 percent from a  earlier, according to the ministry.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Airlines Clash Over Rivals From Persian Gulf By Susan Carey 24 February 2015 The Wall Street Journal A push by top U.S. airlines to get the Obama administration to intervene against the rapid American expansion of three Persian Gulf carriers has triggered a firestorm of opposition much of it from within the U.S. American Airlines Group Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. late last month circulated a 55page briefing paper in Washington, D.C., laying out what they say is evidence that the trio of stateowned Gulf carriers are distorting global trade with the help of huge subsidies from their governments. The Gulf airlines have reiterated their longstanding denials that they receive subsidies or other unfair advantages. A swelling group of U.S. airports, tourism interests, consumer advocates and cargo carriers have complained that the big U.S. airlines are being protectionist, trying to undermine the U.S. \"open skies\" policy that has deregulated a wide swath of international travel, created new jobs and given consumers more choice and lower fares. Since 1992, the U.S. State Department has negotiated 114 openskies treaties with other nations, giving airlines on both sides the ability to fly wherever they want in the other territory, as frequently as they desire and at prices they choose. The U.S. reached an open skies deal with the United Arab Emirates home to Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways in 1999, and with Qatar, the base for Qatar Airways, in 2001. In those days, Etihad hadn\\'t even gotten off the ground, and Qatar, in its current form, was only four  old. Emirates had 11,000 employees. The Gulf trio has expanded rapidly, using hubs in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha to siphon off international travelers who formerly flew on older U.S., European and Asian airlines. Emirates now has 75,000 employees, and is the world largest international airline by capacity. With hundreds of widebody planes on order, the Gulf three have started targeting the U.S., triggering fear that American carriers will meet the fate of their European partners whose market share on routes competing with the Mideast airlines has declined by double digits. In their report, the U.S. airlines allege the Gulf carriers have received $42.3 billion in \"quantifiable\" subsidies since 2004, along with other benefits including breaks on local airport infrastructure and services, exemptions from corporate taxes and advantages from \"opaque\" relatedparty transactions. This allows them, the U.S. airlines claim, to dump belowcost capacity into foreign markets. So the U.S. carriers want Washington to modify or annul air treaties with the UAE and Qatar. Some U.S. companies argue that the three major U.S. carriers simply want to shut the door to competition whose stellar service is winning away customers. Many of the openskies accords also let allcargo airlines fly between multiple foreign countries without touching their home markets. The three big U.S. passenger carriers \"believe they have little to risk by limiting foreign carrier access to U.S. markets,\" David Bronczek, CEO of FedEx Corp. airline operation, wrote in a Feb. 18 letter to the State, Commerce and Transportation departments. But \"we cannot operate internationally and provide efficient, costeffective services without open skies.\" Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways Corp., a New Yorkbased discounter,  in a Jan. 26 letter to the same agencies that such air treaties \"contain ample disputeresolution mechanisms . . . to resolve any legitimate disputes on fair competition.\" He urged the government to continue advancing the openskies policy, saying it has enabled JetBlue international success and partnerships with 30 overseas airlines, including the three Middle East carriers. Trade groups including Airports Council InternationalNorth America, U.S. Travel Association, and Business Travel Coalition also have chimed in against the big three U.S. passenger airlines in recent days. The rhetoric heated up last week after Delta CEO Richard Anderson, speaking on CNN rebutted claims that U.S. airlines benefitted from government subsidies after the 9/11 attacks. \"It a great irony to have the UAE from the Arabian Peninsula talk about that,\" he , \"given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/11, which came from terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula.\" While Delta apologized, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker  later on CNN that Mr. Anderson \"should be ashamed to bring the issue of terrorism to try to cover his inefficiency in running an airline.\" Emirates President Tim Clark rejected the apology, saying on CNN that Mr. Anderson \"crossed the line\" and \"caused great offense in this part of the world.\" The UAE and Qatar are U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State. Etihad, which has a codesharing arrangement with American, hasn\\'t been as vocal, but the carrier reiterated that it operates \"with a clear, commercial mandate\" and doesn\\'t receive subsidies. \"The US carriers have yet to supply us with a copy of [their] report,\" Etihad . Backers of the U.S. airlines include three big U.S. pilot unions. \"There is no question that the broad subsidies are massive and, we believe, unprecedented,\"  Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents the pilots of Delta, United and others. Keith Wilson, president of the union for American 15,000 aviators,  he believes \"these Gulf airlines are playing from the higher side of an unfair playing field.\" Even Southwest Airlines Co. 8,000 pilots, who primarily serve the domestic market, weighed in. Paul Jackson, president of their union,  he is concerned that the Gulf carriers are a longterm threat to U.S. pilot careers. Southwest isn\\'t involved in the dispute, but CEO Gary Kelly, in response to a question last week,  the allegations should be investigated because \"we need a level competitive playing field.\" The big U.S. airlines say they are being heard in Washington, although the government stresses it remains committed to open skies. The Transportation Department  the government \"takes seriously the competition concerns raised by our airlines and will thoroughly review them,\" working with State and Commerce. No decisions have been made. The carriers are broadening their efforts. They recently distributed their report at the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Transportation Committee. One person involved in the campaign  the carriers have found the reception in Washington to be better than hoped. \"It hard for them to say there nothing here,\" this person .',\n",

Bipartisan negotiations are continuing on the final form of a bill which will restrict Congress to a yesorno vote on trade deals in exchange for setting negotiating objectives. The Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Orrin Hatch, has  he hopes to present legislation this month, but it faces opposition from some conservative Republicans and Democrats worried about the impact on jobs. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  a trade deal with 11 Pacific trading partners was nearing the finish line and fasttrack authority was needed to realize the benefits. \"The president has asked for it. The Republican leadership in Congress has indicated it something they want to work on with the president, and it time to get it done,\" he told the National Association of Counties. An updated framework for trade deals would take the need for enforceable labor and environmental standards into account, Froman , highlighting a key issue for many Democrats. The last time Congress passed such legislation, in 2002, only 4 percent of companies on the Fortune Global 500 list were from emerging markets, compared to one in four now, he . Twelve of the largest 50 companies on the Fortune Global 500 list were now stateowned, compared to just one in 2002, and consumers had downloaded more than 25 billion songs through Apple Inc iTunes store, which did not exist in 2002. \"It time to update trade promotion legislation to meet the needs of today global economy,\" Froman . Passing fasttrack legislation is seen as key to sealing major trade deals such as the 12nation TransPacific Partnership, as trading partners can have more confidence deals will not be picked apart in Congress.',\n",
       " 'Shinzo Abe loses internal firewall in TPP trade deal Robin Harding in Tokyo 23 February 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has lost an  ally on the TransPacific Partnership trade deal after his agriculture minster resigned in a scandal over political donations. Koya Nishikawa, a 72old stalwart of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, stepped down amid questions about a Y1m donation from an organisation linked to the sugar industry. Mr Nishikawa maintained he had done nothing illegal but  he was resigning to avoid disruption. The resignation matters because Mr Nishikawa is a longstanding member of the LDP \"agricultural tribe\". He acted as a firewall for Mr Abe against internal party critics on trade deals and farm reform. Negotiators are near a deal on the huge TPP agreement, and agricultural reform is one of Mr Abe top priorities this , so the loss of Mr Nishikawa is a blow to the prime minister agenda. According to reports in Japanese media, the LDP chapter in Mr Nishikawa constituency received the Y1m donation in July 2013 from a building management company run by the Japan Sugar Refiners\\' Association. The donation came shortly before Japan entered talks on the 12nation TPP deal. The TPP is controversial in Japan because big tariff reductions in agriculture will expose its heavily subsidised farmers to competition from Australia, Canada and the US. Mr Abe regards the TPP as a central part of his structural reforms, aimed at boosting Japan growth rate, and curing its longterm economic stagnation. He also wants to reform Japan powerful system of agricultural cooperatives The changes have a political dimension because agriculture has long been a bastion of LDP support, but an obstacle to reform. That means Mr Abe has to overcome opposition from a powerful constituency in his own party. Mr Nishikawa was the third resignation in six months from Mr Abe government after two high profile female ministers, Yuko Obuchi and Midori Matsushima, were forced to quit over political funding scandals last autumn. Mr Abe will nominate Yoshimasa Hayashi, who has held the agriculture job before, as the new farm minister.',\n",
       " \"Treasury Official: Currency Provisions Best Handled Outside Of TPP World Trade Online Posted: February 23, 2015 A senior Treasury Department official late last week cited progress in combating currency manipulation made with China through the Strategic & Economic Dialogue (S&ED), as well as overall progress in international fora such as the G7 and G20, as proof that the issue is best handled outside of trade deals like the TransPacific Partnership (TPP). Nathan Sheets, undersecretary for international affairs at Treasury, cited China commitment during the S&ED in July 2014 to reduce its intervention in the foreign exchange rate. According to Sheets, China has not made any additional foreign currency purchases which have the effect of depreciating the renminbi and encouraging the sale of Chinese exports since making that commitment. Sheets, who spoke at the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Feb. 19, was addressing the larger issue of whether currency manipulation should be addressed through trade agreements. “On the exchange rate issue in particular, we feel that we're making progress and continuing on the lines of bilateral and multilateral engagement is the strategy that likely to be the most effective and most powerful moving forward,” Sheets  in response to a question about if he thought currency provisions should be attached to a Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill or included in TPP. Sheets' view that currency manipulation is best handled in international fora rather than trade agreements echoes a longstanding administration view that currency manipulation should not be addressed in TPP. President Obama has previously indicated that currency provisions will be left out of a final TPP deal. House Ways & Means Chairman Paul Ryan (RWI) has also  believes that currency provisions should be omitted in TPP and has characterized such provisions as “counterproductive,” claiming they would “negate the value” of trade agreements. Sheets  that TPA and TPP are “first order objectives for the administration” and that the Treasury Department is actively engaged in bringing about the passage of TPA and the close of the TPP negotiations. “We're also actively engaged in pursuing the administration trade agenda through high standard agreements such as the TransPacific Partnership, which will expand opportunities and drive further integration with key trading partners,” he . “Together these measures will support the competitiveness of American businesses and promote growth and sustainability, both globally and here at home.” Sheets also reiterated previous comments made in December 2014 that China needs to institute structural reforms to become less dependent on its export market. “In addition, with sliced global demand and global trade now growing at a much slower rate, exportled growth strategies are less viable for the countries themselves and more prone to zerosum competition for market share than in the past,” Sheets  after specifically referencing China. “In countries that are overly reliant on exportled growth, reforms are needed to shift resources to the nontradeable sectors and rebalance the economy toward stronger domestic demand,” Sheets . “Achieving these policy objectives will require efforts to open the financial sector, require increased exchange rate flexibility, and strengthen safety nets.”\",\n",
       " 'Australian fruit fly invasion threatens New Zealand farmers Jamie Smyth in Sydney Financial Times February 24, 2015 5:24 am They are spreading rapidly across Australia, costing farmers hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue. Now, Queensland fruit flies are threatening New Zealand, where a major biosecurity operation is under way following the discovery of several of the insects near Auckland. “This is a very, very significant issue,”  Andrew Coleman, chief operations officer of New Zealand’s ministry for primary industries. “It is the first time we have had an isolated population of Queensland fruit flies. Previously we have only ever discovered a single fly.” Fruit flies are among the world’s most destructive agricultural pests. The brownandyellow Queensland variety is smaller than a human fingernail and has spread from the Australian state of Queensland to New South Wales, Victoria and recently to some parts of South Australia. The flies lay eggs in ripe fruit and vegetables and when their larvae hatch they tunnel through the flesh leaving it inedible. Ministry officials have caught five flies — four males and one unmated female — over the past week in traps in the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn. But at least one mated female is present in the area as 39 larvae and one pupa have also been discovered. Authorities have implemented a control zone extending 1.5km from the location of the finds. Officials are spraying insecticide under the fruiting trees, where larvae burrow into the ground to pupate, and are hanging traps. New Zealand’s horticultural industry is worth about NZ$6bn (US$4.5bn) a , of which about NZ$2.5bn is exported. If the Queensland fruit fly establishes a presence in the country it could lead trading partners to ban imports of atrisk products. Fruit Flies Vinegar flies or drosophila are small, dark brown insects typically found around ripe or decaying fruit. About 3mm long, they can be a nuisance in the kitchen but are not agricultural pests. Mediterranean fruit flies have spread to Western Australia, North and South America. They are about 35mm long with lightbrown bodies and mottled wings. Last month Vietnam banned fruit imports from Western Australia over concerns about the fly. Oriental fruit flies, found in Asia, Africa and South America, have devastated African fruit production and prompted trade restrictions on shipments into Asia, Europe and Japan. Queensland fruit flies are 58mm long and reddishbrown with yellow markings. The flies have spread across New South Wales, Victoria and parts of South Australia. “This is a massive concern and we are throwing absolutely everything at the outbreak,”  Peter Silcock, chief executive of Horticulture New Zealand, an industry body. “If the flies established a foothold then hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars are at stake.” HNZ is pressing for the reintroduction of 100 per cent screening of luggage at airports, saying this is the most likely way the flies entered the country. “Australia has had quite a tough time controlling the fruit flies with finds in Adelaide and changes to control measures in recent ,”  Mr Silcock. “Luggage screening would slow things up a bit for passengers but the high risks make it worthwhile.” Horticulture Innovation Australia estimates the annual cost of control measures, lost exports and contaminated produce related to the Queensland fruit fly is at least A$150m (US$120m). The recent spread of the insect to parts of South Australia — a big wine and fruit producing region — has become a worry for the government, which has implemented a national fruit fly strategy. The latest attempt to control the spread of the flies involves researchers producing sterile male fruit flies en masse to be released in an attempt to suppress the overall population',\n",

Workshops held on 2728 January in Moroni raised awareness on market access for goods and trade facilitation among the public and private sectors and provided a platform for dialogue. The workshops were led by ITC in collaboration with the WTO and Comorian Ministry of Finance, Economy, Budget, Investment, Foreign Trade and Privatization, and funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development. They were planned as part of an ITC project supporting Comoros' WTO accession process. The first workshop focused on the different levels of commitments made on market access for goods and the accession process. Participants received an introduction on WTO accession; a presentation on the technical aspects of tariff commitments, the process and implications of market access negotiations for goods; and an overview of the experience of Yemen, the most recent least developed country to have acceded to the WTO in 2014. During the second workshop on trade facilitation, participants including Comorian public and private stakeholders and central and regional customs authorities learned about the requirements and technical assistance mechanisms of the new WTO Agreement for LDCs. Fostering inclusive participation The workshops promoted inclusive participation in the accession process with regional representatives from the islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli, as well as privatesector stakeholders from organizations such as the Chambre de Commerce, d'Industrie et d'Agriculture d'Anjouan (CCIA), Mouvement des Entreprises Comoriennes (MODEC) et Union des Chambres de Commerce, d'Industrie et d'Agriculture des Comores (UCCIA). According to the privatesector participants, the workshop was a 'wakeup call' that helped to sensitize the public and private sectors on the need to collaborate to ensure a successful accession process. Deputy Minister of Trade H.E. Mr. Said Ben Ousseni acknowledged the importance of privatesector participation and the role of the workshop in serving as a building block in this process.

       " 'Business leaders call for rapid progress on TFA implementation Miami, 23 February 2015 Global business leaders have today called for governments to up the pace in their efforts to implement the landmark World Trade Organization (WTO) deal to cut red tape at borders. Although the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was initially agreed in December 2013, progress has been slow in implementing the deal which ICC estimates could boost global GDP by some US$1 trillion. To date, only three countries Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States have formally ratified the TFA. A need for speed Speaking at the Customs and Trade Facilitation Symposium \\'Finding Solutions to CrossBorder Challenges\\' in Miami, ICC Chairman Terry McGraw, : \"Now we have the agreement in place, we have got to get countries to ratify it. We\\'re talking about 21 million jobs [that could be created]!\" When you consider that this deal could create as many as 18 million jobs in developing countries alone… there as much a moral imperative as a business rationale to get the agreement implemented in quick order. Mr McGraw called for added urgency in implementing the agreement, citing examples of countries that could give a significant boost to local companies in global markets by implementing simple customs reforms. Recent research has shown that Bolivia could boost its trade flows by some $2 billion adopting around the clock customs processing. It is estimated that electronic customs systems in Cameroon could boost local GDP by as much as $700 million. John Danilovich, ICC Secretary General, added: \"When you consider that this deal could create as many as 18 million jobs in developing countries alone… there as much a moral imperative as a business rationale to get the agreement implemented in quick order.\" New opportunities for SME exports Trade facilitation reforms are assuming greater strategic importance as the internet opens up opportunities for small and microbusiness to trade internationally for the first time. One study showed that 95% of companies on eBay export, compared to 15% in most \"offline\" economies. Mr Danilovich noted that these changing dynamics make a clear case for countries to be ambitious when implementing customs reforms highlighting a new ICC policy statement on de minimis values which calls for shipments of less than $1,000 in value to be excluded from duties and taxes at the border. \"This is one part of the TFA where implementation needs to be ambitious to be commercially meaningful,\" Mr Danilovich added.

       " 'No Movement in WTO Services Negotiations as July Deadline Looms By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 25, 2015 Feb. 24 — The World Trade Organization services negotiations remained inert this week as members continued to disagree about the best path forward and the general scope of the discussions. During a Feb. 24 meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Services in Special Session, members requested a subsequent informational meeting to summarize the state of the negotiations that have lain dormant since the 2008 Signalling Conference. The negotiations are aimed at modernizing and clarifying international rules regarding the trade in services—like telecommunications, banking, insurance, construction, distribution and transportation. Though members are seeking to produce a detailed work program by July 31 to conclude the Doha Round, the Feb. 24 meeting showed how far members have to go to achieve actionable outcomes. Aspirations Unclear This  Council Chairman Gabriel Duque of Colombia met with 43 delegations in various configurations to discuss ideas to develop a services work program. Despite Duque engagement, participants in the Feb. 24 meeting generally repeated their positions from the panel last meeting in December 2014. Duque suggested that members engage in an open discussion about what they would like to achieve in the context of the services negotiations rather than how to go about achieving it. Duque  such a process could emulate the discussions leading up to the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial, which structured the negotiations in each sector and mode. Duque suggested that members initially could focus on some of the sectors that had been the subject of plurilateral negotiations, such as: telecommunications; financial services; maritime, land and air transport; energy services; and environmental services, among others. The WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) defines four modes of delivering or trading a service: Mode 1 is where services are supplied from one country to another; Mode 2 is where consumers or firms make use of a service in another country; Mode 3 is where a company sets up branches abroad; and Mode 4 is where individuals travel abroad to provide services in another country. Discussions Premature Several participants at the Feb. 24 Trade in Services Council meeting  a discussion of the scope of the services negotiations would be premature as members continue to disagree about the way forward in agriculture and nonagricultural market access (NAMA) negotiations. The U.S. questioned whether repeating past plurilateral aspirations would contribute to the discussions, as they are nearly a decade old. The U.S.  they stand ready to engage in substantive discussions and urged members to be pragmatic. India called for members to use Annex C of the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration as a benchmark for negotiations and endorsed request/offer negotiations rather than seeking “to reinvent the wheel.” India resisted efforts to uncouple the “what” and the “how” of the negotiations. It is hard to know where the services negotiations can go until more clarity is brought to the agriculture and NAMA discussions, India .',\n",

       " 'US Again Target Of Complaints Of Persistent NonCompliance At WTO DSB Posted By Elena Bourtchouladze On 24/02/2015 Intellectual Property Watch Discussions at the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body meeting yesterday again included the longrunning dispute on a rum brand with Cuba accusing the United States of persistent noncompliance, and other WTO members – such as China and the European Union – urging the US to finally repeal its bill. The US measure was ruled inconsistent with the WTO intellectual property rules 13  ago, and critics warn that the US recalcitrance is harming the dispute settlement system. The agenda of the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body, which took place on 23 February [1], included two disputes related to the WTO Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). These are the US – Section 110 (5) of the US Copyright Act and the US – Section 211 Omnibus Appropriation Act of 1998. In both cases, discussions were on the latest status reports submitted by the United States on the implementation. The US in its status reports sought to show progress is still being made on compliance, but gave no firm commitments on getting them done soon. US – Section 110(5) Copyright Act case In this case initiated by the European Union against the United States, Section 110 (5) of the US Copyright Act was at issue, which allowed the playing of radio and television music in public places (bars, shops, restaurants, etc.) without the payment of a royalty fee. The DSB adopted the panel report on 27 July 2000, finding the Act inconsistent with the TRIPS Agreement. On 12 February [2], the United States submitted a status report on implementation of the DSB ruling. According to the US statement at the 23 February DSB meeting, “the US Administration will continue to confer with the European Union, and to work closely with the US Congress, in order to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.” For its part, the EU stated that they “would like to resolve this case as soon as possible.” US – Section 211 Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998 case The measure under consideration in this dispute, initiated by the EU against the US, was Section 211 of the US Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998, which prevented a CubanFrench company from using the Havana Club trademark in the US and took away company’s ability to challenge the brand, also used by USaffiliated company Bacardi, in US courts. The WTO Appellate Body found the measure inconsistent with the mostfavourednation treatment and national treatment provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, and its report was adopted by the DSB on 2 January 2002. However, some 13  later, the US still has not complied with the ruling but undoing the provision. At the 26 January DSB meeting, the issue was discussed, with Cuba maintaining its pressure on the US to comply. According to a source, the US asserted in the meeting that the case is with the European Union, not Cuba, but Cuba countered that it has economic interest in the case. A WTO source  20 WTO members supported Cuba on a resolution to this longstanding problem. Some members, the source , hoped the thaw in the relations between the US and Cuba, following the statements by President Barack Obama in December 2014, would contribute to the early resolution of this dispute. On 12 February [2], the United States submitted a status report on implementation of the ruling to the DSB, stating that “relevant legislation has been introduced in the current 114th session of the United States Congress” and that “the United States will continue to work on a solution that would resolve this matter.” At the 23 February DSB meeting, the United States declared that “several bills introduced in the current US Congress would repeal Section 211.” According to the US, “these include H.R. 274, H.R. 635 and H.R. 735 – introduced into the US House of Representatives, on January 12, January 16 and February 2 and February 4 respectively” and “other previously introduced legislation would modify Section 211.” “The US Administration will continue to work on solutions to implement the DSB’s recommendations and rulings and resolve this matter with the European Union,” the statement . According to the WTO source, the US  that they have a good record of resolving the disputes in which they are involved – more than 90 percent – and this is one that, because of political problems, has not been solved. Cuba is urging 100 percent implementation, the source . Several WTO members commented on this agenda item, remarking that a longlasting dispute undermines the credibility of the organization, the source . The EU in its statement  that they hoped that “the US authorities will resolve this matter very soon.” China also “urged the United States to implement the DSB rulings and recommendations without any further delay,” noting that “the United States reported no substantial progress.” China  in its statement, “the prolonged noncompliance is highly inappropriate with the principle of prompt compliance under the DSU, in particular since the interests of a developing country Member are affected in this dispute.” According to the statement by Cuba, “it has been 13  since the DSB confirmed that Section 211 (a)(2) and (b) of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998 violated the obligations in terms of national treatment and mostfavourednation treatment established on the TRIPS Agreement and the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.” “The persistent noncompliance in this case could be interpreted by other Members as a sign that it is not necessary to act promptly to complete the recommendations and rulings of this Body. The efforts of a growing number of developing countries sued in the DSB to fulfil their legal obligations in terms of dispute settlement are well known” the statement continued. For Cuba, “the only satisfactory solution to this dispute is the full repeal of Section 211.” Cuba’s statement concluded that “the US government has the institutional capacity and the relevant prerogatives to urge its Congress to repeal Section 211 to put an end to this noncompliance that infringes and violated the equality that we expected to obtain from the dispute settlement system established by WTO.”',\n",
       " 'EU Asks to Join U.S. WTO Case Against Chinese Export Subsidies By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 25, 2015 Feb. 24 – The European Union announced its intent to become a thirdparty participant in the U.S. dispute over Chinese export subsidies before the World Trade Organization. Earlier this month, the U.S. alleged that China provided nearly $1 billion in illegal subsidies to Chinese enterprises in seven industrial sectors over the past three  through its “Common Service Platforms” program (29 WTO, 2/12/15). Under the program, China identified groups of enterprises in certain industries as “demonstration bases” and provided subsidies contingent upon their export performance, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The EU  in a Feb. 24 WTO filing that it is a “major exporter of goods covered under the dispute” and cited its own “substantial trade interest” in seeking to join the talks. ‘Substantial Trade Interest.’ “Chinese goods under the dispute also compete in the European Union market where, in 2014, imports from China surpassed 100 billion Euros [$113 billion], more than a quarter of EU total imports worldwide,” the EU filing . In 2014, the EU exported more than $450 billion in goods, including many of the sectors cited in the U.S. case against China. USTR alleged the Chinese program involved the following sectors: textiles, agriculture, medical products, light industry, special chemical engineering, new materials, and hardware and building materials. “The European Union has manifestly a substantial trade interest to participate as thirdparty in these consultations,” it . After the U.S. and China enter consultations, they have 60 days to forge a solution without proceeding further with litigation. If consultations fail to resolve the dispute, the U.S. may ask the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) to establish a panel of experts to study the dispute.',\n",
       " 'GSP Supporters: We’re Still Hurting By Adam Behsudi | 2/24/15 5:50 AM EST With help from Doug Palmer and Victoria Guida POLITICO More than 600 companies banded together to again urge congressional trade leaders to renew the longexpired Generalized System of Preferences program, which allows them to import certain products dutyfree from developing countries. “What we have in common is the terrible impact of GSP expiration,” the companies wrote in a letter organized by the Coalition for GSP. “The mounting costs and uncertainty surrounding when GSP might be renewed have had a chilling effect on our ability to grow and compete in the global marketplace. Many of us have been forced to lay off workers, cut employee wages and benefits, delay new hires, or cancel job¬creating investments as a direct result of GSP expiration.” GSP renewal “should be a priority because it would have an immediate positive impact on U.S. jobs and competitiveness, and allow us to focus on growth once again,” according to the letter. The companies added that Congress could “stop this bleeding immediately” by reauthorizing GSP retroactively to when it expired in July 2013. The program is noncontroversial, although some members — most notably former Sen. Tom Coburn — have objected to the way the lost tariff revenue is offset. The bill introduced last  would fund the program through a combination of customs user fees scheduled to be collected in 2022, and corporate tax payments whose timing would be shifted. Coburn referred to these offsets — which have been used to fund the program in the past — as “budget gimmicks.”',\n",
       " 'U.S. News: Lawmakers Grapple With \\'Fast Track\\' Trade Bill By William Mauldin 25 February 2015 The Wall Street Journal Lawmakers from both parties are trying to strike a difficult balance as they wrangle over the final intricacies of a bill to expedite consideration of trade deals. House and Senate leaders crafting the socalled fasttrack bill want to include sweeteners to attract skeptical Democrats, including rules to allow lawmakers greater access to the details of continuing trade negotiations. But supporters fear too many provisions friendly to Democrats could alienate Republicans and the business community, or even put a major Pacific trade deal at risk when it comes up for a final vote. The U.S., Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries hope to agree to final terms of the trade partnership in coming months. To smooth passage of the TransPacific Partnership, or TPP, the Obama administration hopes to win fasttrack authority that would allow Congress an upordown vote on trade deals without amendments. Many Democrats, though, fear the terms of a fasttrack bill would deprive them of leverage to help mold the contours of the Pacific pact before it arrives in Congress for a final vote. The bill authors Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) are now fighting over how much leverage to give lawmakers to remove any coming trade deals from fasttrack protection. That would subject the pacts to ordinary amendments and procedural delays. In general, Republicans don\\'t want to insert a mechanism that makes it easier to defeat trade agreements. Another contentious issue is exactly who on Capitol Hill can see and take notes on the Obama administration latest negotiating positions. Lawmakers can request to examine the negotiating text, but typically they can\\'t bring along aides. Some Democratic lawmakers and tradedeal critics want more openness and say the current policy prevents Congress from serving as a watchdog over trade deals. Business groups counter that the negotiations involve trade secrets and sensitive negotiating positions that are expected to change. Mr. Ryan and people following the negotiations for fast track, which is also known as tradepromotion authority, say there is broad agreement to boost access to the text on Capitol Hill. Still, it isn\\'t clear whether such changes will be enough to convince liberal Democrats that their concerns are being addressed. Observers say the legislation has a fair chance of getting through the House: Even if 40 Republicans vote against the bill, the measure could still pass with just a dozen Democratic votes. In the Senate, the bill could achieve the 60vote threshold to advance if Mr. Wyden and likeminded Democrats on the Finance Committee support it. The legislation also sets negotiating objectives for the administration, ranging from protecting intellectual property in medicines to working to avoid currency manipulation by trading partners. But the priorities aren\\'t binding, and adding more negotiating objectives could complicate a final vote on the TPP. \"These negotiating objectives will only be put in if they deliver votes,\"  Gary Hufbauer, senior trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank that backs removing trade barriers. Mr. Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance panel, is betting that more Democratic priorities, including strong trade enforcement, will help win support among Democrats in the Senate and House, observers say. \"I am pushing hard for more transparency and oversight in trade negotiations, much stronger enforcement of the rules to hold trade cheats accountable, strong protections for labor, human rights and the environment,\" Mr. Wyden . So far, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) have kept their powder dry, saying there is a \"path\" to Democratic support. \"There aren\\'t a whole lot of Republicans that are going to drop off if this gets a whole lot more \\'Democrat,\\'\"  Dan Ikenson, director of the trade studies center at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \"If Pelosi and Hoyer support this, then that means more Democrats can come along.\" Republicans also have priorities, and Mr. Hatch has repeatedly backed longterm protection for biologic drug rights, upsetting some lawmakers who worry the deal will limit access to drugs in Vietnam, Malaysia, Peru and other poor countries in the TPP. One big bipartisan concern is how to address alleged currency manipulation by trading partners. Lawmakers in both chambers have signed letters asking the administration to address the issue within the Pacific deal, but U.S. trade representative Mike Froman and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew say they prefer to deal with the issue through diplomatic exchanges, including the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 20 biggest economies. Lawmakers this month introduced bills that would let U.S. firms petition the government to punish rivals overseas when there are signs of currency manipulation to gain trade advantage.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Fed chief opposes currency manipulation ban in TPP deals Kyodo News WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 U.S. central bank chief Janet Yellen  Tuesday she is opposed to the idea of adding clauses banning currency manipulation to any trade deals, such as an envisioned Pacific free trade initiative. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, told a congressional hearing that inclusion of such clauses in the U.S.led TransPacific Partnership deal and other trade agreements would \"hamper or even hobble monetary policy.\" Yellen took the position as some U.S. lawmakers have been increasingly displeased at monetary easing measures in other countries that could result in lowering the value of their currencies, as the recent appreciation of the dollar against other major currencies has hurt American exporters. Some U.S. lawmakers are seeking to introduce a bill that would authorize tariffs on imported products if the United States formally recognizes a monetary policy in the trade partner as currency manipulation. \"I would really be concerned about a regime that would introduce sanctions for currency manipulation into trade agreements,\" Yellen told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in answering a question. Yellen  one of the main purposes of implementing the U.S. monetary policy is to support domestic economic activity such as bids to stabilize prices and boost employment. Even if the foreign exchange rates move as a result of a monetary policy, it should not be interpreted as an attempt to control the currency given that each central bank sets different goals, she . Michael Froman, U.S. trade representative, has taken a similar position over the issue and remains cautious about linking it with trade deals, saying it should be dealt with under international financial frameworks such as the International Monetary Fund. The United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries have been negotiating to sign a TPP within this . END ________________________________',\n",

       " 'WTO LeastDeveloped Countries Request Waiver Of IP Rights On Pharma Products Intellectual Property Watch Posted By Catherine Saez On 25/02/2015 This week at the World Trade Organization intellectual property committee meeting, leastdeveloped countries submitted a request to extend a waiver allowing them not to enforce intellectual property rights on pharmaceutical products. The countries have extended the waiver before, but this time they are seeking to make it indefinite, until they are no longer considered LDCs. Leastdeveloped countries are disproportionately exposed to the health risks associated with poverty, and “patent protection contributes to high costs, placing many critical treatments outside the reach of LDCs,”  a communication [1] [pdf] by the group, proposing to extend the current waiver to intellectual property rights enforcement past the deadline of 2016. In June 2013, a general waiver exempting LDCs from the obligation to enforce IP rights was extended to 2021 [2] (IPW, WTO/TRIPS, 2 August 2013 [3]). This extension covers all products, including pharmaceutical products, and has been running in parallel with the special waiver on pharmaceutical products granted to LDCs until 2016. At the 2425 February Council for the WTO Agreement on TradeRelated Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the LDC group submitted a request to extend the 2016 deadline and in particular to prolong the transitional period for as long as the WTO member remains an LDC. This element was part of the request for the general extension in 2013 but was resisted by a number of countries (IPW, WTO/TRIPS, 12 June 2013 [4]). LDCs, building upon TRIPS Article 66.1 (LeastDeveloped Country Members) providing that the Council for TRIPS “shall, upon duly motivated request by a least developed country Member, accord extensions of this period,” further request that: LDCs be exempted from obligations under TRIPS Article 70.8 (Protection of Existing Subject Matter), relating to patent protection for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products, and Article 70.9, relating to exclusive marketing rights, as long as the WTO member remains an LDC. The proposed extension is not intended to apply to agricultural chemical products, a source . According to a WTO official at a press briefing today, Article 70.8, otherwise dubbed the “mailbox provision” allows an inventor to file a patent application even if there is no patent protection in a given country. It means that even if countries do not have to protect patents, they still have to provide means for patent protection, which would be activated when that country starts protecting IP rights. Taking the floor in the TRIPS Council on behalf of LDCs, Bangladesh  in its statement [5] [pdf] that, “In 2011, some 9.7 million of the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide, lived in LDCs. Of the people living with HIV in LDCs, 4.6 million were eligible for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in accordance with the 2010 World Health Organization HIV treatment guidelines, however only 2.5 million were receiving it.” “LDCs also bear increasing health burdens from noncommunicable disease. For example, cancer incidence is expected to rise to 82 percent in 2030 in lowincome countries compared to 58 percent in uppermiddle and 40 percent in highincome countries,” the delegate . The delegate quoted UNAIDS saying, “There is concern that without extension of the transition period, access to antiretroviral therapy and other key medicines in LDCs will face real challenges.” He also quoted UNAIDS saying, “There is a real danger that if the LDCs do not get a further extension, the progress that has been made to improve access to HIVrelated medicines in these countries will be reversed.” Nepal, China, Brazil and India supported the LDC proposal, as well as the European Union, which  it could not comment yet, but gave general support to the idea, according to the WTO. No country voiced reservation, it . The WTO official  no substantive discussions were carried out during this session, but the subject should be developed at the next TRIPS Council meeting, scheduled for 910 June. Civil Society Reacts to LDC Request A set of responses by nongovernmental organisations was provided to Intellectual Property Watch. Sangeeta Shashikant of the Third World Network , “a specific extension of transition period with regard to pharmaceutical products for as long as a country remains a LDC is critical to facilitate access to affordable medicines in LDCs that already face numerous development and health challenges.” “WTO Members have no right to deny or condition the requested extension as Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement expressly states that the TRIPS Council ‘shall’ accord extensions upon a duly motivated request by LDCs. Such a request has been submitted to the TRIPS Council by Bangladesh on behalf of the LDCs,” she . Brook Baker of Health GAP (Global Access Project) , “Least developed countries need absolute clarity about their right to deny patents on pharmaceuticals, to deny protections for pharmaceutical related data, and to be relieved of any obligations to collect pharmaceutical patent applications and to grant exclusive marketing rights.” “To maximize health outcomes, LDCs should be free from TRIPS obligations for pharmaceuticals as long as they maintain LDC status, which is, in itself, a signal of their many capacity constraints,” he . “In the past the US, the EU and even the WTO have tried to deter LDCs from seeking their maximum transition periods as guaranteed by Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement. They have also attempted to impose unwarranted conditions. Any such efforts in response to the LDCs’ new request would be a grave infringement of the right to health and ironclad flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement,” he added. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors without Borders) Policy and Analysis Director Rohit Malpani  MSF “welcomes the request by Bangladesh, on behalf of leastdeveloped countries, to extend the pharmaceutical transition period until LDCs are no longer classified as such.” “MSF works in many LDC countries and relies on lowcost affordable generic medicines to provide affordable access to treatment,” he . “Any flexibility which can safeguard access to low cost generic medicines and vaccines is welcomed by MSF.” Primah Kwagala of the Center for Health, Human rights and Development in Uganda  “Uganda is in the process of building a strong technological base, and yet to put in place institutional, a legal and policy environment to enable it to move towards TRIPS implementation, freedom from patents on pharmaceutical products will enable Uganda and several LDCs to improve the health prospects of their citizens.”',\n",
       " \"WTO Tobacco Labeling Dispute Intensifies Amid Proposals by United Kingdom, Ireland By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 26, 2015 Feb. 25 — World Trade Organization members continued to spar over the issue of plain packaging of tobacco products during a pair of TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council meetings held Feb. 24–25 in Geneva. The Dominican Republic  that it was concerned that the United Kingdom and Ireland are considering proposals to mandate colors for tobacco packaging and to permit only specified text, such as the brand and the product type (22 WTO, 2/3/15). “One of the fundamental principles of the WTO is that members should regulate in the leastrestrictive way,”  Luis Manuel Piantini, the Dominican Republic ambassador to the WTO. “Plain packaging clearly deviates from this principle, as there are several alternative tobaccocontrol measures available that are truly effective.” “Instead of simply banning all trademarks and geographical indications from tobacco packaging and sticks, the U.K. and Ireland could also consider a much more rational approach and assess each trademark and geographical indication individually and only regulate problematic features, if any,” Piantini . The issue will likely be raised at the next meeting of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Committee and at the next TRIPS Council meeting on June 9–10. U.K., Ireland Proposals In January, the U.K. public health ministry  that the government would introduce plain packaging tobacco regulations in March with the goal of enacting them by May 2016 in order to coincide with the European Union Tobacco Products Directive. In February, Ireland government resumed its consideration of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill. At the TRIPS meeting, Norway  that its government would soon begin consultations on introducing plain packaging rules. New Zealand and France have also considered implementing such rules as a means to reduce smoking. The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Cuba, Indonesia, Honduras and Zimbabwe urged members to await the WTO decision in an ongoing legal challenge against Australia 2011 Tobacco Plain Packaging Act before introducing their own plain packaging measures. Ongoing Legal Case The Dominican Republic and four other WTO members—Ukraine, Honduras, Indonesia and Cuba—are battling the Australian rules in three different WTO panels and are concerned that more countries will seek to restrict how tobacco manufacturers label cigarette packaging. The countries argue that such laws impose unfair restrictions on the use of trademarks, geographical indications and other markings in violation of the TRIPS Agreement, the agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body is not expected to issue its final decision on the complaint against Australia tobacco labeling rules until the first half of 2016. This week Australia  that it supported the U.K. and Ireland tobacco labeling efforts and rejected calls for other members to wait for a WTO decision before introducing their own plain packaging laws. The U.S. is not directly involved in the complaint but has reserved its right to participate as a third party. Pharmaceutical IP Proposal TRIPS Council members considered a proposal, offered by Bangladesh on behalf of the WTO Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to indefinitely extend a waiver of the LDCs' obligations to enforce pharmaceutical intellectual property (IP) rights under the TRIPS Agreement. Bangladesh noted that LDCs are “disproportionately exposed to the health risks associated with poverty” and sought “maximum policy space to enable them to confront their health burdens with effective and affordable strategies,” according to the proposal. “Access to affordable pharmaceutical products is a prerequisite, to deal with the numerous public health challenges facing LDCs,” Bangladesh  in its intervention. LDCs were previously granted an exemption to TRIPS rules regarding pharmaceutical enforcement until Jan. 1, 2016. In 2013, WTO members issued a subsequent waiver to extend an LDC enforcement exemption until 2021. Most of the countries participating in the meetings  that they supported the idea of extending the deadline but disagreed about how that would be accomplished. The issue will likely be discussed again at the June 9–10 TRIPS meeting. At the end of the meeting, TRIPS Council Chairman Mothusi Palai of Botswana relinquished his position to Abdolazeez AlOtaibi of Saudi Arabia.\",\n",
       " 'WTO OKs Panel In New Boeing Case; U.S. Pledges To Comply With CVD Ruling World Trade Online Posted: February 25, 2015 The World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) has established a panel to rule on the European Union claims that a new round of tax breaks provided by Washington state to Boeing amount to prohibited local content subsidies under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) the latest salvo by Brussels in the longstanding fight over subsidies both sides provided to their respective makers of large civil aircraft. The DSB did so at a Feb. 23 meeting at which the United States and Argentina for the first time agreed to comply with separate adverse Appellate Body rulings against them faulting U.S. countervailing duty (CVD) practices and Argentine import policies, respectively. The latest aircraft dispute, in which the EU requested a panel on Feb. 12, was able to move directly to the establishment of a panel because of rules in the ASCM that provide for an expedited timeline for disputes where prohibited subsidies are alleged. Specifically, ASCM Article 4.4 states that if the parties cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days of the consultation request, any party to the consultations may refer the matter to the DSB for “immediate establishment of a panel,” unless the DSB decides by consensus not to establish a panel. By contrast, other WTO disputes are governed by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), under which parties to a dispute can block a first request for the establishment of a panel but not the second. In addition, a party to the dispute has to wait at least 60 days from the date of the consultation request before requesting a panel. In its statement at the DSB meeting, the United States charged that the Washington state tax breaks identified in the EU consultation request are fully consistent with WTO rules. “The United States is therefore prepared to engage in these proceedings, and to explain to the Panel that the EU has no legal basis for its claims,” it . The U.S. insinuated that the EU decision to launch a new chapter in the aircraft dispute would negatively impact all WTO members by further straining the already overburdened dispute settlement arm of the WTO. “We would also question whether the initiation of a new aircraft dispute at this time is the best use of already strained WTO resources. This should be an issue of concern for all Members,” the U.S. . The U.S. also drove home the point that the EU latest request is a completely new dispute that is not related to an earlier WTO case, known as DS353, in which the U.S. was faulted for providing illegal subsidies to Boeing, including through reductions in the Washington state business and occupation (B&O) tax from 2006 to 2024. The EU latest dispute centers on a Washington state law passed in 2013 that extends these and other tax breaks from 2024 to 2040. “There is no basis to accept the EU’s construction that this new, freestanding dispute is merely a new procedural step or somehow a continuation of the current disputes,” the U.S. . A WTO compliance panel is currently examining whether the U.S. complied with the Appellate Body ruling in DS353, and is expected to issue its ruling by the end of 2015. In its statement, the U.S. suggested that the compliance panel in DS353 had already examined the EU claims about the 2013 Washington state law extending the tax breaks, but found that they had to be addressed in a separate dispute. \"The compliance panel in [DS353] already considered those arguments, and rejected them. It found that the arguments the EU seeks to make are new and different from the claims in the compliance proceeding,\" the U.S. . Both the U.S. and Argentina  at the DSB meeting that they would seek to reach an agreement with the complaining parties on a reasonable period of time for them to implement the respective WTO rulings against them. The WTO case over U.S. CVD practices, known as DS437, was brought by China. Taken together, the Appellate Body and panel ruling faulted four aspects of U.S. CVD methodology as violating the ASCM on an “as applied” basis in specific CVD cases on imports from China. Among them was the Appellate Body finding that the way the U.S. uses benchmark prices to calculate whether there is a benefit in certain CVD investigations violated the ASCM. Sources have  they expect the U.S. to comply with the four adverse findings in DS437 by initiating a socalled \"Section 129\" proceeding, in which Commerce would review the CVD determinations and perhaps alter the margins in order to take into account the WTO findings, sources . The dispute against Argentine import policies, DS438, was brought by the U.S., EU and Japan. In that case, the WTO Appellate Body faulted two Argentine import policies as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The first policy required that imports receive preapproval before shipment, while the other was a set of five informal traderelated requirements that Argentina imposed as a condition for imports.',\n",
       " 'China drops leading tech brands for state purchases * State procurement approval withdrawn from major tech brands * Dropped brands include Cisco, Apple, McAfee, Citrix * Shift from foreign brands biggest in security technology * Some say it is in response to U.S. NSA surveillance * Others put the shift down to protectionism By Paul Carsten BEIJING, Feb 25 (Reuters) China has dropped some of the world leading technology brands from its approved state purchase lists, while approving thousands more locally made products, in what some say is a response to revelations of widespread Western cybersurveillance. Others put the shift down to a protectionist impulse to shield China domestic technology industry from competition. Chief casualty is U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc, which in 2012 counted 60 products on the Central Government Procurement Center (CGPC) list, but by late 2014 had none, a Reuters analysis of official data shows. Smartphone and PC maker Apple Inc has also been dropped over the period, along with Intel Corp security software firm McAfee and network and server software firm Citrix Systems. The number of products on the list, which covers regular spending by central ministries, jumped by more than 2,000 in two  to just under 5,000, but the increase is almost entirely due to local makers. The number of approved foreign tech brands fell by a third, while less than half of those with securityrelated products survived the cull. An official at the procurement agency  there were many reasons why local makers might be preferred, including sheer weight of numbers and the fact that domestic security technology firms offered more product guarantees than overseas rivals. China change of tack coincided with leaks by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden in mid2013 that exposed several global surveillance programmes, many of them run by the NSA with the cooperation of telecom companies and European governments. \"The Snowden incident, it become a real concern, especially for top leaders,\"  Tu Xinquan, Associate Director of the China Institute of WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. \"In some sense the American government has some responsibility for that; (China) concerns have some legitimacy.\" Cybersecurity has been a significant irritant in U.S.China ties, with both sides accusing the other of abuses. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, when asked to comment on the Chinese state purchasing moves,  the United States was \"very concerned that many aspects of China recent regulatory actions touted as means to bolster cybersecurity are neither effective cybersecurity measures nor consistent with the principles of free and open trade.\" U.S. tech groups wrote last month to the Chinese administration complaining about some of its new cybersecurity regulations, some of which force technology vendors to Chinese banks to hand over secret source code and adopt Chinese encryption algorithms. The CGPC list, which details products by brand and type, is approved by China Ministry of Finance, the CGPC official . The list does not detail what quantity of a product has been purchased, and does not bind local government or stateowned enterprises, nor the military, which runs its own system of procurement approval. The Ministry of Finance declined immediate comment. \"We have previously acknowledged that geopolitical concerns have impacted our business in certain emerging markets,\"  a Cisco spokesman. An Intel spokesman  the company had frequent conversations at various levels of the U.S. and Chinese governments, but did not provide further details. Apple declined to comment, and Citrix was not immediately available to comment. SECURITY PRETEXT? Industry insiders also see in the changing profile of the CGPC list a wider strategic goal to help Chinese tech firms get a bigger slice of China information and communications technology market, which is tipped to grow 11.4 percent to $465.6 billion in 2015, according to tech research firm IDC. \"There no doubt that the SOE segment of the market has been favouring the local indigenous content,\"  an executive at a Western technology firm who declined to be identified. The executive  the postSnowden security concerns were a pretext. The real objective was to nurture China domestic tech industry and subsequently support its expansion overseas. China also wants to move to a more consumptionbased economy, which would be helped by Chinese authorities and companies buying local technology, the executive . Policy measures supporting the broader strategy include making foreign companies form domestic partnerships, participate in technology transfers and hand over intellectual property in the name of information security. Wang Zhihai, president and CEO of Beijing Wondersoft, which provides information security products to government, state banks and private companies,  the market in China was fair, especially compared with the United States, where China Huawei Technologies, the world largest networking and telecoms equipment maker, was unable to do business due to U.S. security concerns. Local companies were also bound by the same cybersecurity laws that U.S. companies were objecting to, he added. The danger for China, say experts, is that it could leave itself dependent on domestic technology, which remains inferior to foreign market leaders and more vulnerable to cyber attack. Some of those benefiting from policies encouraging domestic procurement accept that Chinese companies trail foreign competitors in the security sphere. \"In China, information security compared to international levels is still very far behind; the entire understanding of it is behind,\"  Wondersoft Wang. But Wang, like China, is taking the long view. \"In 10 or more , that when we should be there.\" (Additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom, Noel Randewich in SAN FRANCISCO and David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON; Editing by Will Waterman)',\n",
       " 'EU and US groups sound alarm on China cyber security rules Christian Oliver in Brussels and Tom Mitchell in Beijing Financial Times February 26, 2015 7:38 am European and US companies have asked their governments for urgent help in stopping the implementation of new Chinese cyber security regulations, which are expected to force local and foreign banks to use information technology equipment deemed “secure and controllable” by Beijing. In a letter to the European Commission dated February 25 and seen by the Financial Times, six business organisations led by Business Europe and The City UK  the “worrisome” Chinese regulations “could close the door for many foreign IT companies to the Chinese banking IT market”. The business groups warned that if fully implemented, the policies “will not only undermine the ability of European companies to participate in the IT market in China and to serve banks in general\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009but also hurt the development and integration of the Chinese banking sector in the global market”. Last September, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued new “guiding opinions” on “secure and controllable” information and communication technologies, which would affect banks’ procurement of equipment including ATMs, point of sales terminals, smartcard readers and cash counters. The regulations would require such equipment to undergo security testing, use Chinese intellectual property and also force developers to share source codes and other sensitive data with Beijing. Multinational companies fear that the new rules, which have not been published in full, could begin to take effect as early as March 15 and could eventually be extended to other industries. “Do they want to carve out business opportunities for Chinese companies that can’t compete with IBM, Oracle and SAP,” one European executive asked. “Is this the first step? Are insurance companies next?” The CBRC declined to comment on Thursday. The MIIT was not available for comment. Many executives and analysts see the new rules as part of a larger and ongoing response to last ’s revelations by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about US espionage activities. But others believe there could be a deeper agenda to boost Chinese companies. “There have always been attempts to promote local companies under the guise of national security. This is not unique to China,”  Duncan Clark at BDA, a consultancy. As online threats race up national security agendas and governments look at ways of protecting their national infrastructures a cyber arms race is causing concern to the developed world Chinese and foreign banks have until 2019 to ensure that at least 75 per cent of their information technology infrastructure in China is compliant with the new regulations, giving the EU and US time to try to dilute their impact. The EU business lobbies asked European commissioners to raise the issue during the course of ongoing trade negotiations, including a SinoEU bilateral investment treaty and the global Information Technology Agreement. The European protest follows a similar appeal by more than a dozen US business lobbies this month to four US cabinet secretaries. The US letter requested the Obama administration’s “immediate action” against the new rules. “If fully implemented, these policies threaten the ability of US companies to participate in the $465bn ICT market in China,” the letter . “Our companies’ losses in turn will translate into decreased R&D investments in the US, harming US jobs and innovations.”',\n",
       " 'Australia to introduce countryoforigin labelling after hepatitis A outbreak By Colin Packham SYDNEY, Feb 26 (Reuters) Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott backed plans on Thursday to introduce countryoforigin labelling in the wake of a hepatitis A outbreak, potentially risking contravention of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. With 18 confirmed cases of hepatitis A linked to consumption of berries sold by Patties Foods Ltd, Abbott  he had asked members of his Cabinet to draft legislation by the end of March to provide greater transparency to consumers. It marked a reversal of his previous position that such legislation would raise the cost of food. Australia was among plaintiffs against the United States after it introduced its own stronger countryoforigin labelling laws for beef products last . The WTO ruled against the United States in October, arguing that countryoforigin labelling provided an incentive to favour domestic livestock. Gerard McManus, a spokesman for Australia agricultural minister,  Abbott had told the minister to ensure the proposed legislation did not fall foul of WTO legislation. Abbott had previously been reluctant to support countryoforigin labelling, insisting it would make food more expensive. However, he  on Thursday efforts would be made to ensure the impact would be as small as possible. \"We don\\'t want to add needlessly to the burdens of business but we do want to ensure that consumers get the information that they need and the public is protected. So we will do it in the most businessfriendly way,\" Abbott told reporters in Canberra. The hepatitis A outbreak has been linked to poor hygiene and water supplies in a Chinese packaging plant. Under current laws, the term \"made from Australian and imported ingredients\" is common, providing no details on the exact origins of all the ingredients in a product or where it was packaged. Producers have increasingly sought to show their Australian credentials after a 2013 Roy Morgan poll showed more than 60 percent of Australians sometimes bought products because they were made in Australia even when they were more expensive than imported rivals. Australia largest food processor and packaging company SPC Ardmona, owned by CocaCola Amatil, began declaring on its labels that all tinned products were Australian grown and canned after it was forced to seek financial assistance.

       " 'Friction over India beef trade heats up after attacks By Meenakshi Sharma MUMBAI, Feb 25 (Reuters) Hindu nationalists in India have stepped up attacks on the country beef industry, seizing trucks with cattle bound for abattoirs and blockading meat processing plants in a bid to halt the trade in the world secondbiggest exporter. The industry is predominantly run by Muslim traders and some groups in the majority Hindu population vehemently oppose it due to the revered status of cows. Beef traders fear that elements in the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be condoning the latest flareup in protests. There has been a surge of raids this month. An official at a beef transport group in Maharashtra state  around 10 vehicles travelling to Mumbai had been stopped, the animals taken forcefully and drivers beaten by members of Hindu nationalist groups despite carrying valid documents. \"We are doing everything legally, but these people harass us and disrupt our work for no reason,\"  Mohammad Shahid Sheikh, president of the beef transporters\\' group in Deonar, the site of India biggest abattoir on the outskirts of Mumbai. Despite the sensitivities over the trade, India has become the world top beef exporter behind Brazil. Traders  the current attacks had not caused major disruption, but if they were to become nationwide could threaten the lucrative business. A majority of India beef comes from buffaloes, which are not worshipped, but members of Hindu nationalist groups involved in protests such as Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) consider themselves protectors of both cows and buffaloes. Some of these groups have close links with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Modi, who himself criticised the previous government for promoting a \"pink revolution to butcher cattle and export meat\". The attacks on beef traders are another example of Modi struggles to contain extremist elements of the BJP support base, whose strident behaviour is dragging on the government economic reform agenda. Modi last week vowed to protect all religious groups after attacks on Christian institutions in New Delhi, which were partly blamed for the BJP drubbing in a state election. The BJP national general secretary, Ram Madhav, declined to comment on the party stance on the beef trade and the protests, while Modi press officer did not respond to calls and a text message seeking comment. Satpal Malik, a vice president of the farmers wing of the BJP, : \"We did say we would discourage beef exports and even the prime minister was against it, but I can\\'t comment on what we think of the issue now.\" CRACKDOWN? Officials in Maharashtra scene of some of the most violent protests seen to date have pledged to arrest anyone found impeding access to slaughterhouses or disrupting cattle movement. A circular had been sent to all the police units to enforce this and was due to be implemented immediately,  a senior police officer from Maharashtra, declining to be named. Mohammad Ali Qureshi, president of the Bombay Suburban Beef Dealers Association,  that while beef processing has resumed at many facilities, he would back calls for a nationwide protest if fresh trouble breaks out. \"We will monitor the situation for a month and if the promises are not kept we will launch a nationwide protest,\" he , in between sipping tea as butchers went about their job in Deonar. But those opposed to the trade vowed to keep staging protests. Killing cows is legal in just two of India 29 states, though reports of illegal slaughter surface regularly. \"We don\\'t care if the butchers shut shop or announce a strike,\"  Laxmi Narayan Chandak, head of the Maharashtra unit of VHP cow protection committee, which says it has been seizing cows held illegally for slaughter for . \"The previous government supported the butchers to secure votes of the minority community but they have no support in the new government.\" India beef shipments in the last  to October rose to 1.95 million tonnes, 5 percent more than for the whole of 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A senior official at a leading India beef exporter  that exports had been rising because of robust demand from China and other big consumers. \"But if supplies are disrupted for a longer period then definitely it would hit our productivity.\" (Additional reporting by Rupam Jain Nair and Krishna N.

       " 'U.S. lawmakers battle over currency in trade deals By Jason Lange and Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) U.S. lawmakers are drafting battle plans to punish foreign rivals accused of currency manipulation but a growing chorus of critics argue the battle is already won and warn the push may derail a massive trade pact. A bipartisan bill introduced this month and proposals from other lawmakers seek to stop trading partners such as China and Japan from manipulating exchange rates to make their goods cheaper for overseas buyers. The trigger for the new currency offensive is a nearly completed TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. It encompasses 12 Pacific Rim trading partners including Japan, whose stimulus program has helped lop off a third of the yen value since late 2011, worrying U.S. automakers like Ford Motor Co. And China is seen by many Americans as a great stealer of jobs, following  in which Beijing weakened its currency to undercut American manufacturers. Insistence on a currency chapter in the deal is widely seen as a \"poison pill\" which could derail the entire pact and reflects many lawmakers\\' distrust of more open trade. \"You always need a bogeyman, someone to blame your troubles on,\"  Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor who was a top economist in the Clinton White House. A series of respected economists and former top officials have voiced concern that currency restrictions will derail the trade pact, although some are also lined up on the other side. \"Almost certainly, the effort would be a classic deal breaker,\" former Treasury official Ted Truman wrote in a blog post last week. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen spoke out against the currency proposals on Tuesday, telling senators such rules could \"hobble\" monetary policy. Evidence these days is scant that either Japan or China, America top trading partners in Asia, are engaged in currency manipulation following decades of U.S. pressure to lay off. Even backers of currency rules concede Japan is not manipulating its currency now, although they warn it could again in future. Japan yen is weakening thanks in part to the same policies pursued by the U.S. Federal Reserve and it maintains that it has not intervened in currency markets since 2011. Tokyo signed on for a 2013 Group of Seven agreement, pushed by Washington, in which it agreed to use monetary policy only to boost domestic growth. The U.S. Treasury has been increasing pressure on South Korea, another potential TPP partner, to let the won appreciate, but does not consider Seoul a currency manipulator. China, according to the U.S. Treasury, has stuck by a deal struck in 2014 that it would not intervene and the yuan has appreciated 57 percent in real tradeweighted terms since 2004, more than almost any other currency tracked by the Bank for International Settlements. While Beijing could choose to reverse course and the central bank still controls the exchange rate by setting an official trading band, economists say slowing economic growth, interest rate cuts and capital outflows mean market forces, rather than purchases of dollars, are weakening the yuan. China now appears to be intervening to prop the currency up, as evidenced by the slight decline in its near $4 trillion in dollar reserves during the fourth quarter. \"We have to get used to the new reality,\"  David Dollar, who was the U.S. Treasury top emissary to China between 2009 and 2013, a time when America was actively pressing Beijing to stop weakening the yuan.

       " 'S. Korea, China initial bilateral free trade pact By Byun Dukkkun SEJONG, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) South Korea and China initialed their free trade agreement (FTA) Wednesday, taking a step closer to implementing what South Korean officials hail as the most significant trade deal for the country. The initialing came about three months after the two countries concluded their FTA negotiations that began in May 2012. The agreement, currently written only in English, will be translated into the two parties\\' native languages before it is officially signed. \"The two countries\\' governments have agreed to work for official signing of the KoreaChina FTA within the first half of 2015,\" the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy  in a press release. The free trade pact requires approval from the countries\\' respective legislatures for implementation. \"The government will do its utmost to have the agreement ratified by the National Assembly without any disruption so that our companies can start benefiting from the KoreaChina FTA at an early date,\" the ministry . Some new and positive elements have been added to the agreement since the conclusion of negotiations on Nov. 10, Woo Taehee, South Korea deputy trade minister,  at a press briefing. Firstly, 310 products from the interKorean joint industrial complex in Kaesong, North Korea, will immediately benefit from a reduction or elimination of China import tariffs, he . Such an agreement compares with only 100 products in South Korea FTAs with Peru and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The two countries have also added a new standstill clause in their bilateral agreement that will prevent either side from raising or adopting new customs duties on any products or services, according to Woo. \"We cannot say every element in the agreement is more favorable to us as negotiations always involve more than one party,\" he . \"But I believe we have in our hands a wellbalanced agreement that reflects the interests of both parties in negotiations.\" Through additional dialogue, South Korea has gained better market access and established a better business environment in China for financial and communications service providers, the trade ministry . Under the FTA initialed and exchanged with China Ministry of Commerce in Beijing, the two countries have agreed to provide preferential treatment to each other financial firms and to set up a new committee to jointly deal with any business problems for the firms. They also guarantee nondiscriminatory access to communication networks by companies entering each other market, the ministry . South Korea deputy trade minister Woo Taehee briefs reporters on Feb. 25, 2015 in Sejong on the details of a free trade agreement (FTA) with China. The FTA was initialed by the two parties on the same day. (Yonhap) The FTA is expected to become the most significant trade pact for South Korea as China is already its largest trading partner. China, the world largest single importer of South Korean goods, accounted for more than onefourth of South Korea overall exports in 2014, according to the trade ministry. Under the KoreaChina FTA, South Korea will completely eliminate its tariffs on 79 percent of all products, or 9,690 items, imported from China within 10  following its implementation. China will reciprocate the move on 71 percent of the products, or 5,846 items, from South Korea over the cited period. Within 20  after the FTA goes into effect, South Korea will eliminate its tariffs on 92 percent of all goods from China, with China eliminating its own import duties on 91 percent of products from South Korea. The Seoul government has maintained the proposed FTA with the world secondlargest economy will cause little or no damage to local farmers as 596 out of 2,240 agricultural and fisheries products currently imported from China will be permanently excluded from market liberalization while 16 others, including rice, were not subjects of negotiations from the beginning. The government, however, acknowledged Wednesday that 44 items from China, including tobacco and onions, will not be protected under special agricultural safeguards (SSGs), which allow temporary import restrictions for special market circumstances, such as a sudden increase in imports. \"No SSG has ever been implemented for any of the items that have been excluded from the safeguard mechanism in the KoreaChina FTA, and there is very little possibility that any of them will require such a measure in the future,\" an agriculture ministry official told reporters. Following its implementation, the KoreaChina FTA is expected to help boost the countries\\' annual bilateral trade to over US$300 billion, a 39.5 percent hike from $215.1 billion in 2012. Also, South Korea trade territory, represented by the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of countries with which South Korea has a free trade pact, will grow to 73 percent of global GDP from the current 61 percent.',\n",
       " 'Africa tripartite free trade area set for launch in May Feb 24,2015 NAIROBI, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) Negotiations have been finalized in preparation for the launch of Africa largest free trade area in May, officials  on Tuesday. The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Assistant Secretary Kipyego Cheluget told a media briefing in Nairobi that the free trade zone will result from merger of the East African Community (EAC), Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and COMESA. \"All the 26 member states in the three trading blocs have expressed great political will to allow the free movement of goods and services by end of May,\" Cheluget  during the opening ceremony of the Afrik4rComesa 1st peer review meeting. The FTA would cover 26 countries ranging from Egypt to South Africa with a combined population of 625 million people and an aggregate GDP of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. These figures represent half of the African Union membership and 58 percent of the continent economic activity, according to COMESA. Cheluget  after the launch, all the members states will be required to ratify the agreement before the FTA takes effect. The COMESA Assistant Secretary General  the tripartite will form a building bloc to the continent wide free trade agreement. Since July 2014, the African Development Bank has also been supporting the Tripartite Capacity Building Programme (TCBP). He added that the main objective of the programme is to provide technical assistance to the three regional economic blocs and the tripartite countries with the view of increasing intraTripartite trade. \"The programme will also support the tripartite negotiations process, the development of trade facilitation instruments as well as an industrial cluster action plan for the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA),\" he . The launching of the TFTA is the first phase of implementing a developmental regional integration strategy that places high priority on infrastructure development, industrialization and free movement of business persons. In order for the Tripartite FTA to realize inclusive and equitable growth, officials agree on the need for expeditious formulation and implementation of a regional industrial programme. Cheluget  the Tripartite FTA offers significant opportunities for business and investment within the Tripartite and will act as a magnet for attracting foreign direct investment into the tripartite region. The business community, in particular, will benefit from an improved and harmonized trade regime which reduces the cost of doing business as a result of elimination of overlapping trade regimes due to multiple memberships, Cheluget added. The FTA was originally endorsed at the Tripartite Summit of Heads of State and Government in Johannesburg in June 2011. That endorsement came three  after another tripartite summit in Uganda, where the Heads of State and Government of the respective regional economic communities (REC) on a \"programme of harmonisation of trading arrangements amongst the three regional economic communities.\" The tripartite will create a single market of approximately 600 million people and account for about 58 percent of the Africa Gross Domestic Product. Cheluget added that once operational, the trading bloc will help to increase intraAfrica trade. \"We want to ensure that trade within the continent reaches to the level of that of other continents,\" he . The enlarged FTA will include Libya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland.',\n",

       " 'World Bank denies report on Malawi global poverty position LILONGWE, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) The World Bank Tuesday denied having published a report which ranked Malawi as the poorest country in the world in 2015 as media reported recently. The media articles alleged statistics quoted from a latest World Bank report pegged Malawi at the top of poverty scale in the world and the news sparked a heated debate among local and international commentators. But the Bank  in a statement it was not responsible for the quoted statistics and described the report as erroneous. \"The press articles refer to a report allegedly published by the World Bank which has ranked Malawi as the poorest country in the world in 2015; the World Bank has not published such a report, \"  the statement. The statement  the statistics being published erroneously labeled the figures as GDP per capita (Purchasing Power Parity) when in fact they were GDP per capita (Current USD), adding that in quoting the data, press reports often confused GDP per capita in current USD with GDP per capita in Purchasing Power Parity terms. World Bank releases World Development Indicators (WDI), which among other data sources include statistics on Gross Domestic Production (GDP) per capita for all countries and, according to the statement; the latest WDI available is for 2014 presenting 2013 data. The Bank added that the intention of WDI was not to rank but to provide a compilation of relevant, high quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. \"The purpose of publishing GDP per capita is not to measure poverty but levels of income per capita,\" explains the Bank in its release. \"Comparisons of living standards across countries are best made using both monetary and nonmonetary parameters such as Human Development Indicators and Multidimensional Poverty Index.\" The Bank added that in PPP terms, although Malawi had a low GDP per capita in 2013, it was comparatively not the lowest in the world.

       " 'WTO Efforts On Doha Work Program Face Obstacles, May Miss July Deadline Inside U.S. Trade 02/27/2015 World Trade Organization members are facing such fundamental differences and are at such a preliminary stage in their efforts to devise a work program to conclude the stalled Doha round that Geneva sources expressed doubts they can meet their July 31 deadline for establishing a detailed blueprint for potential negotiations. Others sources  WTO members will likely be able to develop more general guidelines for a work program by the July deadline. The July 31 deadline was set forth in a decision WTO members approved at a November 2014 General Council meeting at which they resolved a stalemate over implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The deadline for producing the Doha work program was originally December 2014, but it was pushed back due to the TFA impasse. Among the fundamental differences is whether the 2008 blueprints for agricultural and nonagricultural market access (NAMA), known respectively as Revs. 4 and 3, should be the basis for negotiation or should be changed with respect to certain obligations, such as the formula for negotiating market access and the exceptions from that formula. Another fundamental issue is whether the core negotiations on agriculture, NAMA and services should proceed at the same time, as the EU has demanded, or whether the agriculture area takes priority, as some developing countries have demanded. Coupled with that, the members advocating for changes to the 2008 texts have been floating only ideas, not specific proposals, partially for fear that they could be asked to pay for their demands, a Geneva source . He speculated that talks could continue for months before members start tabling proposals. Other Geneva sources  countries are holding off for fear of having their proposals shot down. The U.S. and European Union have been frontrunners in talking about the need to have a simpler approach to the market access rules in agriculture, but have not specified what that would entail. \"The need for a simpler, more realistic market access approach has been stressed by a large number of members during our conversations up until now,\" EU Ambassador Angelos Pangratis  at a Feb. 20 General Council meeting. At a January Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) meeting, Pangratis mentioned average tariff cuts as a potential alternative. Others have mentioned the possibility of considering the approach used in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which was an average cut coupled with a minimum cut to ensure countries were not completely shielding all their sensitive products, one source . But some Latin American members of the Cairns Group including Paraguay and Chile have  that would undermine the transparency and predictability on market access. If members were to endorse an average tariff cut in the work program with no other stipulation, it would be impossible to tell what tariff level they would get for their products such as beef and wheat, a Geneva source . Therefore, some countries are seeking the transparency and predictability provided by a formula approach. Under this approach, members would know exactly what the tariff cuts others are offering in contrast to the requestoffer approach that is dependent on bilateral negotiations. It is unclear exactly how specific the work program will be in terms of the methodology for negotiating market access. If the work program simply lists a given approach, such as average tariff cuts, the countries seeking transparency and predictability will likely haggle until they can get more specifics, one source . If they want more before the work program is agreed, it will take longer to develop, he . On Feb. 3, Argentina floated a nonpaper that also advocated a simpler approach to market access negotiations in agriculture, NAMA and services that consists of the requestoffer method, which already applies to services. Argentina suggested that negotiating using the requestoffer approach could be a potential solution to the negotiating \"logjam\" experienced by the WTO on agriculture and NAMA since 2008. According to the nonpaper, the requestoffer method could cover cuts and elimination of tariffs, binding of unbound products and the creation of a tariffrate quota or the volume expansion of an existing one. So far, no WTO member has rejected the idea outright. At the Feb. 20 General Council, U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Michael Punke did not rule out that approach but he warned that it would be considerably more complex and timeconsuming, a point also made by Japan. Punke  with the acceptable parameters, which he did not specify, it could be \"well worth further exploration.\" On market access, the 2008 agriculture modalities contain complicated tariff formulas aimed at cutting higher tariffs more than lower ones, but they are coupled with exceptions for special and sensitive products that developing and developed countries could exempt from tariff cuts, as well as special safeguards that developing countries could invoke against imports. These flexibilities were fought for by the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group, the African Group, and the Least Developed Countries group, and these groups have thus far insisted on maintaining the agriculture and NAMA modalities because of those provisions, Geneva sources . In NAMA, the 2008 modalities envision a Swiss formula, which applies different coefficients to developing and developed countries but aims to cut higher tariffs more than lower tariffs. At the General Council, Punke strongly criticized the 2008 agriculture text for its imbalance on domestic subsidies obligations. The U.S. would be the only country that would have to cut its domestic agriculture subsidies under that text while emerging economies that have increased their domestic subsidies significantly since 2008 would not have to undertake any cuts, he  in an apparent reference to India, Brazil and China. That finding came from a Jan. 28 analysis prepared by the Cairns Group on how the 2008 agriculture modalities would affect members\\' subsidies programs. \"Meanwhile, those Members have stated clearly their expectation that this mindboggling imbalance, which would clearly fall short of any true effort to reform tradedistorting agricultural subsidies, should be preserved,\" he . The U.S. cannot endorse such an outcome, according to Punke. Geneva sources  that Canada and Australia were among the countries that called for the U.S. to reform its agriculture programs when the Cairns Group analysis was discussed at an informal special session of the agriculture committee held on Jan. 28. But they also acknowledged that there would be a \"price to pay\" by other trading partners to the U.S. in terms of concessions if the U.S. accepted the 2008 text. Punke made clear that an agriculture text acceptable to the United States needs to include concessions from developingcountry members that currently maintain significant domestic subsidies and have the production capacity to influence global trade. He made clear that this amounted to a differentiation among developing country members, but failure to reflect those difference will make it impossible to advance negotiations. In the informal meeting of the agriculture negotiating committee, India and China endorsed Rev. 4 and made clear they are unwilling to take on more obligations to cut their domestic subsidies. Punke summed up the efforts on the Doha work program by saying that members are \"nowhere near consensus\" on it. \"We are quite distant from a common view of what a work program should look like, or how it could realistically enable us to conclude the Round in a manner that works for everyone,\" he . In the same meeting, WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo also told the General Council that the views of members have not changed significantly since negotiations on establishing modalities fell apart in December 2008. But he  members are now substantively engaged. \"Progress is slow but we are moving forward,\" he . There are two parallel sets of consultations in the WTO in an effort to advance the work program, Azevedo announced at the General Council. One track is conducted by the chairs of the negotiating groups on agriculture, NAMA and services, and it focuses on more technical work, he . Parallel to that, Azevedo is holding his own consultations at the ambassador level in his role as the TNC chairman. He  the aim of his consultations, held on Jan. 21 and 29, has been a \"deeper political discussion\" that up to now has focused on agriculture, NAMA and services. Azevedo consultations include socalled \"green room\" meetings on agriculture with select members, including the U.S., EU, India, China, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, one source . Azevedo  he has shared the outcome of his consultations with the wider membership, including at the TNC and the General Council. The agriculture negotiating group has met informally on Jan. 28, and after the General Council meeting. The focus of its work has been on domestic subsidies and the market access pillar. That is because the export competition segment is unlikely to undergo major changes. Negotiations on NAMA and services are at a more preliminary stage as the NAMA chairman has only met with about 40 members bilaterally, with the main focus on tariffs. An openended meeting of the negotiating group has been scheduled for March 2, Azevedo . Progress in those two areas has been stymied by some members\\' insistence that the level of ambition on agriculture must be established before work can begin in earnest there. Brett Fortnam',\n",
       " 'WTO Chief Urges Members to Focus on Solutions as July Deadline Looms ICTSD Bridges 26 February 2015 WTO members need to shift into “solutionfinding mode” if they aim to develop a work programme that would lead to a quick conclusion of the Doha Round trade talks, DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo  on Friday at a meeting of the organisation’s General Council. The global trade body’s members have only five months left – until July – to sign off on this work programme, after a previous end2014 deadline was extended last November. “In the past few weeks, members have started to engage more substantively – particularly in the three core areas,” Azevêdo reported on Friday. “Progress is slow, but we are moving forward.” The WTO chief characterised the tone of the past month’s talks to date as positive, even if no major changes have been seen in members’ known positions across the Doha areas. “And from my conversations with ministers I am confident that there is now real political will behind our work. That is truly invaluable.” Since the start of the new , Azevêdo has been holding his own consultations with members on the planned work programme, as well as two broader “Room W” meetings that brought together the full membership. The latter meetings involve ambassadors plus one official for each member, and are geared toward allowing members to interact directly across all Doha issues, rather than repeat past positions. Negotiating group chairs have also been holding their own meetings, which have continued this week. In some negotiating areas, for example, information or stocktaking sessions have been held to familiarise members with the past discussions. While useful, the WTO chief has  that members now need to move to the next stage if they hope to make real progress. “If we are to do this then members need to be ready, willing, and able to discuss the shape of the deals that they believe to be achievable,” Azevêdo . Members divided on approach to 2008 draft texts The three core issues of a potential Doha Round work programme are broadly agreed to be agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA), and services. In that context, members have been debating on whether to use the 2008 draft texts for both agriculture and NAMA – known as Rev. 4 and Rev. 3, respectively – as the starting point for the work programme discussions, and if so to what extent. “When we connect the dots, what is revealed, undeniably, is that we are nowhere near consensus,” US Ambassador Michael Punke  on Friday. “To illustrate what I mean by a lack of consensus, I would cite the fact that we now have clear indications from a number of members, both developed and developing, that Rev. 3 in NAMA is not a viable basis for concluding our negotiations, while others remain attached to that text,” he added. Regarding Rev. 4 in agriculture, the US official cited the “very stark presentation of facts” that Washington would be the only member that would need to cut its current domestic support programmes, should the 2008 draft text on agriculture be applied. (See Bridges Weekly, 5 February 2015) “Meanwhile, those members have stated clearly their expectation that this mindboggling imbalance, which would clearly fall short of any true effort to reform tradedistorting agricultural subsidies, should be preserved,” Punke , adding that the US will not be able to endorse such a result. In recent weeks, a series of new formal and informal proposals have been tabled by members in the agriculture talks, on issues such as export subsidies and tropical products. Issues of market access have also been raised, with the US strongly pushing for increased access in large developing economies, as well as domestic support concessions from China and India. (See Bridges Weekly, 19 February 2015) Washington has been specifically advocating for “differentiation” regarding market access – an approach that has been criticised by some major developing country members such as India – with Punke stressing on Friday that this suggestion would not entail “graduation” or a new category of members under the WTO. Rather, the US official , those developing countries with large agricultural domestic support programmes and influence on global markets “will necessarily have to participate in negotiations, and contribute to outcomes,” at a level that other developing countries that do not meet this criteria would not. “Such developing countries are different from other developing countries, and we cannot succeed if we pretend otherwise. But let me also be clear: the United States is not seeking new market access outcomes in Doha from those WTO members who would not have applied the formula under the existing NAMA framework,” he . India, for its part, reportedly  on Friday that the trading system was highly inequitable and trade often did not lead to development. NAMA, services The outcome of the talks on agriculture are widely expected to set the level of ambition for the other two core areas of the negotiations, though some members reiterated on Friday the importance of balance across the three topics. “All of the core issues need to be taken forward in parallel and will have to achieve commensurate levels of ambition,” EU Ambassador Angelos Pangratis  at Friday’s meeting. “Still, the EU accepts that agriculture may determine what will and won’t be possible in the [Doha Round] overall, keeping in mind, however, that finally a balance will be needed within the agriculture pillar as between all the areas of a possible outcome.” Regarding NAMA, discussions so far have taken the form of bilateral meetings with that negotiating group’s chair, with the focus mainly being on tariffs. The group will hold an openended meeting next Monday to discuss the results of these consultations. One of the main questions that has come up so far is whether to continue with the socalled Swiss formula outlined in Rev. 3, or to pursue alternative approaches, as advocated by some members. The Swiss formula in the 2008 draft text involves using separate coefficients for developed and developing country members in calculating tariff cuts for industrial products, with higher coefficients meaning lower tariff reductions. Formulaapplying members would only be around 40 of the WTO’s 160, with others having special provisions. However, those members that would use the Swiss formula under Rev. 3 make up approximately 90 percent of global trade. Under this formula, developed countries would be subject to the same coefficient of 8, while developing countries will have a few options (20,22, 25) depending on the level of flexibilities they would like to use, with a lower coefficient involving high flexibility, and vice versa. Some members in favour of moving away from the current version of the Swiss formula appear to be interested in either more flexibilities or coefficients, sources say. One potential factor in the talks would be how the EU pursues its suggestion of “simplification” in NAMA, one official suggested, as well as what other members who have advocated for “alternative approaches” might suggest. On services, an openended meeting was held on Tuesday, following up on bilateral consultations that the negotiating group chair has held in recent weeks with over 40 members. The chair, Colombian Ambassador Gabriel Duque, urged members on Tuesday to consider “what” their aspirations would be for a Doha services outcome at this stage, rather than discussing “how” to get there. Talks on the latter would likely depend more on the progress seen in parallel discussions in agriculture and NAMA, sources familiar with the services talks . Some members, reportedly led by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) country group, requested that an informative meeting be organised as a refresher on the services negotiations to date. Similar exercises have already been held in recent weeks in other negotiating groups, such as the discussions on a geographical indications (GI) register for wine and spirits under the TRIPS Council. Requestoffer suggestion Argentina recently suggested in an informal nonpaper the possibility of using a “requestoffer” approach for market access in agriculture and NAMA, which would essentially entail countries requesting trade concessions from negotiating partners, and also identify areas in which they could make reciprocal offers. The suggestion is not yet a formal proposal, sources say, but has already sparked some discussion among the membership. Some sources familiar with the discussions have  that, while the suggestion as a standalone approach would be unwieldy and probably unlikely to gain much traction, it could possibly work in tandem with other methods. For instance, requestoffer could be used by interested members in the NAMA talks on top of using formulas, one suggested. The subject was raised at last Friday’s General Council meeting, with the US ambassador among those expressing an interest in further discussions, without specifically backing the idea. “We welcome this contribution to the discussion as a muchneeded element of the fresh thinking the United States has long been seeking,” Punke  in his intervention, indicating that the US would like to study the suggestion and discuss it with proponents in further detail. While advocating caution in pursuing the requestoffer approach, given that it “could prove to be significantly more complex and timeconsuming than any of us might current envision,” the US official  that the topic could be worth exploring at greater length – provided that the approach was framed by “acceptable parameters” on areas such as duration and scope. Next steps While no dates have been confirmed for the next Room W meetings at this stage, the WTO chief  that more will be held in the months to come following his return from various meetings abroad. For the moment, negotiating chairs are holding additional group meetings to discuss next steps, in an effort to move from the general to the specific. The next meeting of the General Council is currently scheduled for 56 May.',\n",
       " \"USAID Official Says Countries Will Need Help Implementing Trade Facilitation Agreement By Brian Flood WTO Reporter, February 27, 2015 Feb. 26 — Trade assistance officials are beginning to get a picture of the areas of the Trade Facilitation Agreement that developing countries will need the most assistance in implementing,  Virginia Brown, director of the Office of Trade and Regulatory Reform at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Based on the submission to the World Trade Organization of developing countries' “Category A” commitments—those TFA commitments that these countries pledge to immediately implement—Brown  developing WTO members likely will need assistance with TFA obligations to implement a single window for customs documentation, authorized operator schemes, notifications for enhanced controls and inspections, test procedures and the periodic publication of average release times of goods. Speaking at a trade roundtable held by Georgetown Law School Feb. 26, Brown  USAID would pursue a publicprivate partnership in offering TFA assistance, as private businesses will be wellpositioned to identify what roadblocks to the movement of goods across borders need particular attention. To that end, she , USAID will partner with five other donor countries as well as the private sector to put together a “Trade Facilitation Alliance.” The TFA will only enter into force once it has been domestically ratified by twothirds of WTO members. The WTO was delayed for almost six months in its plans to open up the TFA for ratification, however, over India demands relating to the issue of food security (12 WTO, 1/20/15). Richard Eglin of White & Case LLP, and former director of the WTO Secretariat,  the WTO original deadline of July 2015 to begin implementing the agreement is now “completely implausible.” To date, only the U.S., Singapore and Hong Kong have domestically ratified the agreement, while Chile has prepared legislation to do so (37 WTO, 2/25/15). Ultimately, the degree to which the TFA is implemented by its individual members will determine whether it is remembered as a success for the WTO, Eglin . Reaching for Capacity However, the WTO itself is not a capacitybuilding operation and does not have the institutional capacity to provide much support to members' implementation efforts, Eglin . Rather it must work with the World Bank, multilateral and regional donors and the private sector. To ensure countries are not making empty promises to implement the provisions of the TFA, there should be a mechanism for the private sector to provide continuous feedback about the actual progress member governments have made to reduce border wait times and other barriers to the movement of goods,  Amgad Shehata, a senior vice president of UPS. The most  factor in the success of the implementation effort is the political will within member governments,  Evelyn A. Suarez of The Suarez Firm. The will for such reforms is undercut, however, by the high level of corruption in some countries around the world, she .\",\n",
       " 'EU requests WTO dispute panel over Russian import duties BRUSSELS, Feb 26 (Reuters) The European Union  on Thursday it was escalating a dispute with Russia at the World Trade Organisation over what it  were excessive import duties on paper products, refrigerators and palm oil. The challenge is the latest in a series of WTO disputes with Russia, the EU thirdbiggest trading partner, since Moscow joined the body in 2012, although they have been overshadowed by titfortat sanctions triggered by the crisis in Ukraine. \"The EU requested today the establishment of a dispute settlement panel at the World Trade Organization in Geneva concerning Russia excessive import duties, in particular on paper products, refrigerators and palm oil,\" the European Commission  in a statement. The European Union  it had sought a solution with Moscow in consultations at the WTO in November, but that it had failed to convince Moscow to reduce its 15 percent tariff on paper products. In the case of refrigerators and palm oil, the European Union  Russia sets a minimum sum for its tariff, which is sometimes higher than the agreed duty expressed as a percentage of the product value. The dispute settlement panel continues a lengthy process that could eventually result in Moscow being fined and told to drop the tariffs, as well as allowing the European Union to adopt counter measures. Trade ties between Brussels and Moscow are already at a low ebb. The EU accuses Moscow of a string of restrictive trade practices including policies to protect the Russian car industry. Meanwhile, Russia banned imports of food from Europe in August, part of its response to EU sanctions imposed over Russia seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing for proRussian rebels.

       " 'India Stockholding Policies to Undergo Scrutiny in WTO Agriculture Meeting By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 27, 2015 Feb. 26 — World Trade Organization members will seek greater clarity on the extent of India public stockholding programs for food security purposes during the March 45 meeting of the WTO Agriculture Committee. The U.S. recently asked India for more details about its domestic food security programs, an issue that was hotly debated during the 2014 Trade Facilitation Agreement impasse. One key responsibility of the Agriculture Committee is to evaluate how countries are complying with their commitments on subsidies and market access. The Agriculture Committee will also review the negotiations being discussed in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture. India Public Stockholding The U.S. asked whether the $12.28 billion India spent on public stockholding for food security purposes in 20092010 included hundreds of millions of dollars worth of agricultural bonuses issued by India states. The U.S. specifically asked India to confirm the amounts of statelevel bonuses and total statelevel funding expenditures from 20092010. The U.S. asked India to confirm that it had not exported grains from its government stocks since 20062007. The U.S. cited public government data that showed the Food Corporation of India exported 3.07 million metric tons of wheat in 20122013 and 2.34 million metric tons of wheat in 20132014. Members are working to update the organization 19861988 pricing benchmark used to calculate tradedistortion measures. Their negotiations are driven by a 2014 agreement to devise a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue by the end of 2015 (230 WTO, 12/1/14). U.S. Agriculture Several members including the European Union, India and Australia asked the U.S. why it no longer notified the WTO secretariat about its subsidies related to crop insurance premiums as nonproductspecific aggregate measurements of support (AMS) but on a productspecific basis instead. India asked the U.S. to explain why it calculated market price support for dairy products in certain  and calculated support for butter, nonfat dry milk and cheddar cheese in others. India also asked why certain U.S. agricultural insurance programs do not include cropspecific provisions and urged the U.S. to disclose the per unit rate charged for electricity used to transport irrigation water. Australia asked the U.S. to explain how it calculated subsidies for barley, canola, corn, cotton, dry peas, flaxseed, honey, oats, peanuts, rice, sorghum, soybeans, sugar and sunflowers. Canada asked the U.S. to explain why chickpeas, lentils and wool are no longer included in the list of products receiving productspecific support. Cotton Subsidies The U.S. asked China about the longterm impacts of its subsidies for domestic cotton production, which totaled nearly $6 billion in 20122013. “While it is true that China minimum support price did not immediately have a large negative impact on world markets, given that China continued to import and stockpile cotton, it appears the longterm impacts may differ,” the U.S.  in its inquiry. “China is the world largest producer, consumer, and importer of cotton,” the U.S. . “A change in any of these variables can have significant impacts on world markets.” The U.S. again asked China why it has not yet submitted its notifications for 2009 and 2010. The U.S. prodded India about its decision to increase the minimum support price for cotton in 2015 given reduced import demand in China, the decrease in global cotton prices and historic levels of India cotton production. The U.S. asked India to ensure that the release of its cotton stocks does not further exacerbate international cotton markets and to pledge to avoid using export subsidies or export at below the cost of procurement to dispose of cotton stocks. Canadian Dairy The U.S.  it was concerned with the “proliferation” of Canada 39 special milkpricing classes, according to the WTO document. “These products are produced using heavily discounted dairy inputs and are then sold in domestic and foreign markets,” the U.S. . The U.S. noted that Canada offers special milk class prices to domestically manufactured frozen pizza products, something “which displaces and substitutes imports from trading partners with dutyfree access,” according to the inquiry. New Zealand sought reassurance that the proposed changes to Canada tariff quota for cheese under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union will comply with its WTO commitments. Canada  it plans to introduce a Cairns Group paper detailing recent trends in domestic support. The Cairns Group is a coalition of agricultureexporting countries concerned with reforming agriculture trade; Canada, Australia and New Zealand are members, but the U.S., China and India are not.',\n",
       " 'WTO Delays Ruling in Chinese Complaint Against U.S. Use of Targeted Dumping Rules By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, February 27, 2015 Feb. 26 — A World Trade Organization panel  it would delay its report on a trade dispute regarding U.S. antidumping duties on Chinese goods until mid2016, according to a recent notice. The dispute stems from China objection to the U.S. Commerce Department targeted dumping methodology and its use of a controversial “zeroing” methodology. Commerce applied targeted dumping and zeroing methodologies in three investigations regarding imports of Chinese coated paper, oil country tubular goods and highpressure steel cylinders, as well as the review of an existing duty order on imports of polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet and strip. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body  it would defer its panel report until June 6, 2016, due to the complexity of the dispute and the unavailability of secretariat lawyers to assist the panel. The panel report had been expected in early 2015. Zeroing Practices Zeroing is the practice by which an investigating authority compares the export price and domestic price of an allegedly dumped good and then aggregates the results of the comparisons to calculate a dumping margin for the product as a whole. When aggregating the prices, the investigating authority ignores negative dumping results where the product is sold at a higher price abroad than domestically. Critics of zeroing practices say they illegally inflate dumping margins and result in higher antidumping duties. The WTO permits the use of targeted dumping methodologies if an investigative authority identifies a pattern of export prices for allegedly dumped goods that differ among different purchasers, regions or periods of time. In its complaint, China argued that Commerce practice in determining whether targeted dumping exists did not appropriately identify significantly different patterns of export prices needed to justify the use of the methodology.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Moves Toward Greater Trade With Africa By Neanda Salvaterra 26 February 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News The U.S. completed a deal that commits five African countries to reducing trade barriers in a plan that also provides them with technical assistance to export mostly African agricultural products to American consumers. Privatesector analysts  they view Thursday deal as a major step toward a full freetrade agreement on a continent where the U.S. has no such accords. The countries in the East African Community trading blocBurundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Ugandahave been strategic partners with the U.S. in a bilateral trade initiative since 2013. Trade in goods among the five bloc countries and the U.S. totaled $2.8 billion in 2014, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Exports from the bloc to the U.S. have primarily consisted of apparel, while the top U.S. exports to the bloc include aircraft and heavy machinery. U.S. imports from the bloc totaled $743 million in 2014, while U.S. exports to the countries amounted to $2 billion. The U.S. is playing catch up to China, which surpassed the U.S. as Africa largest trading partner in 2009, and the European Union, which has already signed freetrade agreements with 33 African countries in which European goods receive preferential treatment even ahead of African exportersa move some critics say undermines intraAfrican trade. At the dealsigning ceremony in Washington on Thursday morning, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman called the agreement \"an  steppingstone for deepening what has already proven itself to be a promising and impactful partnership.\" The EAC countries have already implemented numerous changes, such as removing checkpoints to reduce the transit time to Kigali, Rwanda, from the port city of Mombasa, Kenya, to six days from 21. Mr. Froman  the trade initiative would be expanded to include other African nations. The U.S. has an existing trade framework with the continent but the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which gives 40 African countries tarifffree access to the U.S. market, is set to expire in September and was chiefly created to boost development in Africa. The new agreement commits stakeholder countries to implement customs overhauls like those laid out by the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement. Under the deal, the U.S. will also help the trade bloc meet the technical and sanitary standards for food exports to the U.S. Paul Ryberg, president of the African Coalition for Trade, an association of African privatesector groups trading with the U.S.,  he considers the deal a building block toward a freetrade agreement between the U.S. and the EAC. African exporters say the goal is a freetrade pact with the U.S. that would eliminate barriers to trade for African and U.S. exports. \"It opened the U.S. market for more African products,\"  Ambassador Tuvako Nathaniel Manongi from the permanent mission from Tanzania to the United Nations. \" I have seen chocolates from Tanzania in Whole Foods,\" he , adding it was enabled by Trade Africathe initial agreement between the U.S. and the EAC. Total trade in goods has grown 103% in the past five , 52% in 2014 alone, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Danielle Walker, director for African affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  she thinks the deal sends a strong signal. \"The East African Community has really embraced free trade and they are reaping the benefits, \" she .',\n",

       " 'Cheap is king: Russia, Ukraine add to China steel export flood By Manolo Serapio Jr and Maytaal Angel SINGAPORE/LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) Steelmakers from Asia to Europe are facing increasing pressure from a rise in cheap imports as Russia and Ukraine, armed with weaker currencies, join China in pushing surplus output on to world markets. The flood of lowpriced material and weak demand will keep a lid on global prices, already at their weakest level since 2009, threatening the future of producers elsewhere and raising the risk of protectionist measures. \"We are feeling hopeless, totally hopeless. I am not sure we will be able to survive,\"  R.K. Goyal, managing director at India midtier producer Kalyani Steels Ltd. \"Some of our customers are demanding a heavy reduction in prices.\" Russia and Ukraine boosted their steel shipments abroad to 46.4 million tonnes in 2014, according to consultancy CRU, nearly half of the record 93.78 million tonnes of steel shipped by China, the world top exporter. \"One could legitimately ask whether Ukraine and Russia are becoming a new China in the export markets, not in terms of volume, but in terms of their impact on price,\"  Dmitry Popov, who watches the steel sector in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at CRU. Despite the recent removal of some tax rebates, Chinese exports are expected to hold at 80 million to 90 million tonnes this  due to chronic overcapacity and shrinking demand at home, says the China Iron and Steel Association. Even without the rebate, Chinese steel may still be $5 a tonne cheaper than most other suppliers, but this is an edge that Russian producers can now match or even surpass,  Roberto Cola, head of the Philippine Iron and Steel Institute. \"China competition will be Russia. Like China, Russia is also battling overcapacity,\"  Cola. China has an advantage over Russia in Asia given its proximity and a number of free trade deals that limit regional trade barriers. The Philippines, which once imported steel from Russia, was China thirdbiggest market last . But Russian exporters have a similar advantage in Europe, strengthened by the recent collapse in the rouble. \"At present, Russian material is perhaps the most attractive foreign steel in the European Union given the weak rouble,\"  Jeremy Platt, analyst at MEPS. The Russian currency has nearly halved against the dollar over the past , while the Ukrainian hryvnia has fallen more than 60 percent. This has put their steel producers at the lowest levels on the global cost curve,  CRU Popov. Russian producers are better placed to increase shipments than their Ukrainian rivals who face output disruptions from an ongoing war, but Ukrainians are still able to cut prices. In January, the export price of hotrolled coil from the CIS, made up of mostly Russian and Ukrainian steel sales, briefly dipped to $435 a tonne, $10 below Chinese prices, according to Popov. PROTECTIONISM ON THE RISE Amid rising exports, share prices of Chinese and Russian steelmakers have outperformed their global rivals, including Luxembourgbased Arcelormittal and South Korea POSCO . Russian producers such as Severstal, Evraz and NLMK have extended their rally into 2015. But the growing steel glut is spurring protectionist calls. In Asia, Indonesia has imposed duties of 26 percent on imports of construction steel products from this , easing slightly in two , applying mainly to top supplier China. India is considering raising import tariffs after producers such as JSW Steel Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power lobbied the government. In January, Turkey launched an investigation into hotrolled coil imports from a range of countries, while European steel body Eurofer has called on the EU for greater protection for its members. \"Definitely we are seeing the risk of protectionism on the rise,\"  Andrey Laptev, head of corporate strategy at Severstal, which increased exports by 5 percent last month and plans to grow shipments further. But with global steel consumption forecast to rise by just 2 percent this , smaller producers face being shut out. \"Steel mills are operating in an increasingly competitive environment and without a major change in the present supply/demand situation the threat of closures will only increase,\"  MEPS\\' Platt.',\n",
       " 'U.S. aviation giants split on Gulf carrier subsidy row By Jeffrey Dastin and Tim Hepher Feb 26 (Reuters) A push by three U.S. airlines to curb competition from Gulf state carriers has exposed divisions over free trade with other powerful U.S. aviation players including Boeing Co and FedEx Corp, potentially complicating the airlines\\' campaign for Obama administration support. Delta Air Lines Inc, United and American Airlines have asked the White House to look into the financial statements of competitors from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which they accuse of receiving more than $40 billion in government subsidies since 2004. But calls for the United States to tamper with Open Skies agreements with the Gulf nations are at odds with the stance of other major U.S. companies that benefit from the pacts. The agreements eliminate barriers that would block some FedEx operations and slow the expansion of carriers like Emirates that have showered Boeing with orders. Boeing, which like European rival Airbus has filled its order book with commitments from Gulf carriers,  it would continue to support pacts such as the more than 100 Open Skies agreements negotiated by the U.S. since the 1990s. \"Boeing supports a commercialaviation industry based on open and fair competition, and Open Skies has long been a key factor in this, benefiting both U.S. and international airlines,\" spokesman Jim Proulx  in an emailed statement. Boeing later added that it was not jumping directly into the feud between some of its biggest airline customers. \"We are in no position to make judgments about the allegations, nor is it our role to do so,\" spokesman Tim Neale . But experts say the groundswell of support for Open Skies from Boeing, FedEx and others could make it easier for the White House to resist renegotiating individual agreements. \"I think the entry into the fray of Boeing and the others as countervailing pressures to the airlines will make it easier politically for the administration to do what I believe the Department of Transportation wants to do, namely, to continue to pursue its successful Open Skies strategy,\"  New York University law professor Michael E. Levine. Other companies were more blunt. \"The U.S. should not capitulate to the interests of a few carriers who stand ready to put their narrow, protectionist interests ahead of the economic benefits that Open Skies provides,\" David Bronczeck, chief executive of FedEx Express air cargo unit  in a Feb. 18 letter to the heads of the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation and Commerce. JetBlue Airways Corp, which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, wrote a similar letter. Meanwhile, a group representing 200 North American airports  it had written to the Obama administration warning that the U.S. \"leadership role\" in international aviation could be threatened by any weakening of the Open Skies policy. LIBERALIZATION DISPUTES Delta, United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc say in the report which has been reviewed by Reuters but not yet been made public that they support Open Skies agreements but not their abuse through what they regard as tradedistorting Gulf subsidies. Historically, however, analysts say the top U.S. carriers have been involved in frequent disputes about liberalization. \"The major U.S. carriers have opposed Open Skies and deregulation all along the way, even from the word go, and yet have been major beneficiaries due to domestic consolidation and also globally in terms of market access,\"  Peter Harbison, a chairman of Sydneybased consultancy CAPACentre for Aviation. Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways deny receiving subsidies. So far, the Obama administration says it is reviewing the U.S. airlines\\' claims but has made no decisions. In an interview with Reuters Wednesday, Emirates President Tim Clark hinted at possible legal action over potential commercial harm done by the U.S. airlines\\' campaign. The clash between Delta and the Gulf airlines has taken a caustic turn, including remarks by Delta chief executive that were perceived as linking the Gulf carriers with the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.. Delta later clarified its remarks and apologized. Clark also called his U.S. rivals\\' service \"shoddy\" and  they would do better to focus on improving their own product. The Business Travel Coalition, a forprofit company whose clients include travel agents and corporate travel managers, agrees that the top U.S. airlines have only themselves to blame for the market share loss, a contention disputed by Delta.',\n",
       " 'WTO rules make it difficult for Cisco and Apple to challenge Chinese government \\'black list\\' South China Morning Post Friday, 27 February, 2015, 11:13am Bien Perez Complex World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations will make it very difficult for the US government and major technology companies to take legal action against Beijing decision to drop Apple and Cisco from its approved state procurement lists. When the Chinese government joined the WTO in December 2001, Beijing did not sign up to a plurilateral treaty on government procurements. As a result, China is able to remove any foreign brands that the government doesn’t like from its state procurement lists with little potential WTO blowback. Among the global technology brands that Beijing took off its approved state procurement lists – a de facto “black list” for state purchases of certain foreign brands in what some analysts  was a response to revelations of widespread Western cybersurveillance – the chief casualty was US network equipment maker Cisco Systems. In 2012 the company had 60 products on the Central Government Procurement Centre (CGPC) list, but by late 2014 had none, Reuters reported earlier this week, quoting an analysis of official data. \"Virtually all leading US tech companies are at risk of being affected, including Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, EMC, Qualcomm, Citrix and Apple,\"  Stephen Ezell, a senior analyst at United Statesbased think tank the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"Unfortunately, direct options for recourse by trading partners through multilateral venues are limited, largely because China has failed to accede to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), despite a commitment to do so after the country joined the WTO in 2001.\" File photo of workers preparing for the opening of an Apple store in Hangzhou. Photo: Reuters The GPA was implemented under the auspices of the WTO in 1996 to ensure open, fair and transparent competition in the government procurement markets of the parties to the treaty. It currently consists of 43 WTO members, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. China and 27 other WTO members participate as observers. While business see their prospects in the mainland public sector decrease, affected foreign hitech companies may find it difficult to simply pack up and leave since the mainland remains the world thirdlargest information technology market, behind the US and Japan. Total government and enterprise spending on information technology goods and services on the mainland is estimated to reach 807 billion yuan (HK$1.02 trillion), up 8 per cent from last , according to the latest industry forecast by Forrester Research. The Forrester report, which excluded consumer and corporate telecommunications services expenditure, projected the US market to reach US$862.8 billion this , followed by Japan at 19.9 trillion yen (HK$1.3 trillion). A man walks past an advert for the iPhone 6. Photo: Reuters It also predicted that China would record the secondfastest growth, behind India, in the US$2.3 trillion global information technology market this , despite concerns about the mainland economy slowing down. Charlie Dai, an analyst at Forrester Research in Beijing,  the publicsector strategy to buy less foreign information and communications technology products \"does not violate China WTO commitments because it only the purchase guideline for the government, not a regulation that affects the whole market\". \"[Mainland] Consumers normally don\\'t care about the regulations in the public sector,\" Dai . China decision to raise spending on domestic information technology products was  to be in response to revelations of widespread Western cybersurveillance, which former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed in 2013.

       " \"Modi goes globeplotting 2 March 2015 India Today (c) 2015 Living Media India Ltd For long, New Delhi has followed an incremental approach in the execution of its foreign policygradual and graded. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to change that. He wants to maximise outcomes, corner all that India can get or gain from any country, meet his counterparts more than halfway even if that means added political risk. In short, he wants to align India foreign policy with his expansive and ambitious domestic agenda. However, in doing so, Modi is also raising expectations on delivery, an area where India has been found wanting. Be it attracting investments or taking up projects in other countries, particularly the neighbourhood, India response has often fallen well short of the talk. It between these poles that the Modi government foreign policy is beginning to take shape around a few clear principlesbring best practices to energise domestic initiatives such as Clean Ganga, smart cities and renewable energy; emerge as an economic magnet and net security provider in South Asia, extending to the India Ocean; increase clout by organising the influential India diaspora as a strong lobby group; locate the sphere of influence in a cultural narrative. His is a maximalist approach, which starts with removing political hurdles that obstruct meaningful economic cooperation. For instance, when the new Sri Lankan president was coming to India, it was clear that not much could have moved in substantive terms as the political situation in Colombo is still fluid. Yet, the idea of a civil nuclear agreement was explored and sealed, simply to signal that both countries have overcome the negative sentiment generated by fears of India building reactors in Kudankulam. It was a similar idea that helped resolve the nuclear liability issue with the United States and allowed the two sides to move on and focus on issues such as AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) membership. Neighbourhood and the zone of influence Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was sitting the farthest among the Turkmenistan AfghanistanPakistanIndia (TAPI) gro up of ministers when Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif reached out to him at the steering group meeting in Islamabad. He took him aside and walked a while, asking him about Modi and how he was coping in power. Sharif sent a warm message through Pradhan, signalling once again that he was keen to engage. The Pakistani government had, in the meantime, sought to address India concerns over LashkareTaiba commander ZakiurRehman Lakhvi possible release by ensuring that he remains in prison, which was seen positively in India and created an opening to climb down from its position of no talks. Yet, concerns remain because Pakistan still wants the freedom to talk to separatist groups in Kashmir. And that why Modi 'cricket diplomacy' is . Beneath the symbolism is a fresh attempt to rope Pakistan into the SAARC narrative. Given that the political environment in all neighbouring countries is in India favour at this point, the idea is to push the envelope with Pakistan and get matters moving under the SAARC rubric. If Pakistan continues to be recalcitrant, then India would step up efforts at the subregional level by initiating projects such as the BBIN grid, which seeks to provide grid connectivity across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. On the bilateral plane, government insiders say, India may be open to looking at Pakistani proposals for restructuring the dialogue mechanism. The Sharif government had suggested creating a separate dialogue on Kashmir and terrorism, moving out of the composite dialogue structure. There are counterviews to that in South Block but insiders say India is willing to explore this if Pakistan shows the intent to move forward on the SAARC economic cooperation agenda. Along with this, New Delhi has decided to explore the limits of its influence in the India Ocean with the Prime Minister set to visit Maldives, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Seychelles in March in a bid to link them to the India security matrix. This would be an extension of the Maldives model, opening up possibilities of joint military exercises and training. Similarly, up North too, while maintaining the traditional relationship with Russia, New Delhi is now working on a major push in Central Asia. It likely that highlevel visits, including at the PM level, may follow to key countries in this area, particularly Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Also being explored is a cultural connect that dates beyond the Islamic phase in the region, pointing to an era where trade and transit flourished despite the difficult terrain. If there is one area where the Modi government plans are still on the drawing board, it West Asia. Fighting a tricky security situation there with growing ISIS influence, the view in South Block is to let the US play the lead and avoid any contentious decision that may upset the equilibrium. Hence, the temporary pushback to the demand from BJP ideologues on changing the Palestine vote and weighing decisively in favour of Israel. Big powers and the west The United States is clearly central to Modi plans. By showing a willingness to address US concerns, particularly on the economic side, the government is hoping to reap dividends across the developed world as many of those issuesfrom nuclear liability to liberalising FDI regimesare common to other countries. Besides, closer ties with the US are necessary for deeper intelligencesharing, which is crucial to counter terror attacks. But here, the larger focus is on attracting best practices in priority economic areas. After a recent meeting of all India heads of mission in Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is preparing a todo list for all mission heads that essentially would task India ambassadors and high commissioners to proactively identify areas of expertise in their respective domain countries which can give an impetus to Modi domestic agenda. So ahead of his visit to Germany in April, a study has been done to figure out how the cleaning of Rhine river can serve as a model for cleaning the Ganga. It believed that this is the model that will eventually be worked upon in India. Germany has also been identified for partnering on the solar rooftop plan besides adopting a couple of smart city projects. France, the other country Modi will visit during the same trip, is being targeted for spurring the 'Make in India' initiative in the defence sector. At a political level, the idea is to move beyond the complex European Union (EU) structure and strike bilateral initiatives with key power centres of the EU such as France and Germanyeven Spain is being included in the list. Looking east Strategic considerations play out here the most given China preeminence and the security concerns that arise from its growing clout. The big shift under Modi, according to sources, is that he wants to reduce the barriers to do business with China and has instructed officials to find a way by which India does end up deterring Chinese investment. Setting up industrial parks is one such example. While that effort is underway, India is stepping up engagement with China own neighbourhood, setting itself up as a benign and better alternative when it comes to longerterm economic cooperation. Japan, therefore, has emerged as the focal point along with South Korea as future investors in India. The challenge however is to provide a credible option in Southeast Asia. India has not moved fast enough on connectivity projects such as the trilateral highway across Myanmar and Thailand; or for that matter shown intent in strengthening defence partnerships with smaller countries in the region. The UPA government had adopted a cautious policy on this front to avoid provoking China. At the same time, the bigger challenge would be to balance this out with economic accommodation of China through ASEAN regional free trade agreement regime RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). The commerce ministry fears that China would gain freer access to its markets through this agreement but insiders say matters have come to a point where New Delhi may just appear to be the only holdout and would need to take a call soon. For this reason, a closer economic relationship with China has to be balanced by a robust security architecture and that is the delicate balancing act, besides delivering on deadlines, the Modi government is backing itself to do under its Act East policy. Diaspora connect Reunion Island is among the tiniest outlying Francophone outposts in the India Ocean, over eight hours from Paris, but still a sovereign French territory. A sizeable chunk of its population is of India origin, an almost forgotten cultural connect that Prime Minister Modi is set to exploit. Nothing major, just an outreach by way of a speech in Paris that will be telecast live on this island miles away when Modi visits France in the next two months. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav, it is believed, is already on the job, working out the logistics. Foreign policy in the Modi era is not a simple case of furthering national interest. It also about reconstituting the India identity on which interests are constructed, a scheme of things in which the few hundred thousand Indiaorigin people in Reunion Island are also counted as an  political constituency, a source of power. So, behind the loud cheers of Madison Square Garden or in Sydney lies a cold factthis is organising India international population under Modi leadership. And to this end, all the previous NRI outfits of the BJP such as the Overseas Friends of BJP, have been made redundant. It a firm belief with Modi that once the overseas India population coalesces around him, his clout as PM will increase. This is different from his predecessors, who worked hard at forging strong personal bonds with their foreign counterparts. Modi, on the other hand, is keen to make a political statement as not just the Prime Minister of India but also the voice of all Indias. This is a clear political effort being spearheaded by the BJP which is using its clout with India forums overseas to ensure that party actions move in tandem with the government. And where it difficult to find a sizeable diaspora, the effort is to set up friendship forums and nurture them through party contacts. Meanwhile, the party side of the foreign policy business is now focused on influencing the revamp of the India Council for Cultural Relations. Last heard, plans were afoot on creating programmes around the reach and influence of Yoga, Ramayana and the Vedas. Press Release\",\n",

All Rights Reserved. President Obama, facing an uphill climb in persuading Congress to grant him the authority to complete significant trade deals, sought to ease concerns on Thursday that such agreements would help corporations at the expense of American workers. The public relations push includes a series of programs to promote exports from rural areas and help more small and mediumsize American businesses sell their goods and services overseas. The president also scheduled a series of interviews with local television stations around the country to make the case that American workers and businesses had benefited from previous trade deals and stood to gain substantially from pending agreements with Asia and Europe. We want to make sure China is not writing the rules, Mr. Obama told KGW in Portland, Ore. We have to get this bill done. Its going to be  for Oregon. He also spoke to stations in Fargo, N.D.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Seattle. That sort of groundlevel advocacy is something that I do think will persuade Democrats and Republicans, frankly, to take a close look at some of the trade agreements that the president is trying to broker,  Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The president continues to be confident that if American workers and American entrepreneurs and American businesses and American farmers are given a level playing field, that they cant just compete, theyre going to win, and thats going to be good for our economy. Republicans in Congress are putting the finishing touches on legislation that would grant Mr. Obama socalled trade promotion authority to present trade deals for a quick upordown vote, shielding the agreements from congressional amendments. The president needs that power, also known as fast track, to push through the TransPacific Partnership a trade agreement involving a dozen countries that is near completion and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, another sweeping deal that is being negotiated with European nations. Getting these trade deals done will benefit our businesses and middleclass workers, not just in rural communities, but across the country, Bruce H. Andrews, the deputy secretary of commerce,  Thursday in a conference call with reporters organized by the White House. Exports have been a key driver of our economic comeback. Still, some members of Congress in both parties particularly the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans oppose granting Mr. Obama the trade power he seeks, worried about how trade agreements will affect American workers and loath to cede their ability to shape such deals. And many lawmakers fear a backlash from their constituents similar to the one after the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. Democratic senators took to the Senate floor on Thursday to detail how Nafta and agreements like it had killed jobs and depressed wages in their states. They called attention to their opposition on Twitter with the hashtag #NotAnotherNAFTA. Over the past 20 , freetrade deals have shipped jobs overseas and cut wages for the jobs that remain,  Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania workers know that the rules of free trade are rigged against them. In an oped article in The Washington Post on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, argued that a provision of the TransPacific Partnership would undermine American sovereignty by allowing foreign companies to challenge United States laws. Administration officials say the new agreements will help American workers by opening markets for United States products and improving environmental and labor standards around the world. The president has made a very compelling case for how this benefits American workers, Cecilia Muoz, the chief of Mr. Obamas Domestic Policy Council,  Thursday. Mr. Obamas team is armed with statistics that it says show that the United States has essentially no choice but to strike trade deals to open more markets to American goods. Mr. Andrews and other officials  95 percent of the worlds consumers live outside the United States, but only 5 percent of American businesses export their goods. Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary,  30 percent of agricultural sales are directly related to exports. Officials have noted that there are 525 million middleclass consumers in Asia, a number that is projected to grow to 3.2 billion over the next 15 . We see a tremendous opportunity with T.P.P. to access that expanding middle class, Mr. Vilsack . Amazon, a technology company obsessed with secrecy, is hiring a former press secretary for President Obama, whose administration has been widely criticized for its aggressive leak investigations, David Streitfeld reported. Jay Carney, who resigned as the presidents chief spokesman last spring, is joining Amazon as senior vice president for global corporate affairs, a new position, the retailer  Thursday. It is an unusual hire for the Seattlebased company, which tends to groom its talent internally, rather than bring in prominent outsiders. Mr. Carney, who begins his new job on Monday, will report to Jeff Bezos, Amazons founder and chief executive. Mr. Carney will oversee both public relations and public policy. Amazon generally has disclosed as little as possible about its business activities.',\n",

To a large extent, it is lawmakers from the president own party that they have to convince, with wary Democrats concerned that such agreements ultimately cost bluecollar jobs. The administration released a new round of statebystate statistics on Thursday aimed at highlighting the importance of trade to the economy. \"Exports are critical to economic growth and job creation across the country,\" Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker . \"From the state of New York to New Mexico, businesses of all sizes are realizing that their customer base is no longer just around the corner.

Washington DC, United States President Barack Obama has stepped up his campaign for expanding exports and negotiating new trade deals in Asia and Europe, a rare spot of common ground with Republicans and a raw point of friction with Democrats. Obama is pushing his trade themes in interviews with television stations from states represented by the handful of Democratic senators who may be willing to side with the president on his plans for new commerce agreements. There have been times in the past where some of the trade deals didn't work out for particular sectors in particular communities,'' Obama told KMBC in Kansas City, Missouri. Which is why we're organizing trade in the Asia Pacific region, the fastest growing region in the world, to make sure you have strong enforceable labor provisions, make sure you have strong enforceable environmental provisions, make sure you have a level playing field.'' Before making those deals, however, Obama wants authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can only approve or reject, but not amend. Presidents have had an increasingly tough time getting that authority from Congress; Bill Clinton had to buck his party to win it and George W. Bush got it by a single vote. But Obama task may be even tougher. He has a harder challenge because the last Democratic president (Clinton) who did this did it in the context of a historic economic boom, a period in which globalization still looked like it had enormous upsides with relatively little downside,''  Rob Shapiro, a former senior Commerce Department official and economic adviser to President Clinton. The upsides are still there, but the downsides have become more apparent.'' The Obama administration on Thursday released data promoting the role of exports in the economic recovery. According to the White House, exports supported about 11.3 million jobs in 2013, an increase of 1.6 million over 2009. For Obama, connecting trade to jobs is a key sales pitch because past trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, have been blamed for job losses and for businesses moving overseas. The administration is also making the case that a 12nation TransPacific Partnership agreement that would include Japan, Australia and Vietnam in the deal, also would serve the nation economic security interests by providing a bulwark against China. China is out there negotiating free trade agreements with many of these same countries,''  Maurice Obstfeld, a member of Obama Council of Economic Advisers. These agreements are not based on enforceable labor standards, enforceable environmental standards, and what we would like to do is level up the playing field rather than leave it to others to level down the playing field.''

Chi, president of the China Institute for Reform and Development (CIRD), a Chinabased thinktank, made the remarks here on the sidelines of a symposium Friday under the EUChina Reform Agendas, a project colaunched by CIRD and Brusselsbased Center for European Policy Studies. To further ChinaEU service trade cooperation, both sides should work to reduce trade frictions, speed up negotiation regarding the signing of SinoEU Bilateral Investment Treaty and strive to sign the treaty within the  of 2015, he . The economist urged China and the EU to make best use of thinktanks in Free Trade Area (FTA) feasibility study, and make a breakthrough in the regard in 2015, thus striving to initiate FTA negotiations as early as 2016 and enter into a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement in an earlier manner. CHINA'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION He  the upcoming five  is a critical period for China transformation from a major manufacturing economy to a major service economy, saying the economic restructuring and reforms set for the period carries great significance for China medium to long term sustainable economic growth.

The transformation in China will unleash a potential consumption demand amounting to 40 to 50 trillion yuan (6.38 to 7.98 trillion U.S. dollars), providing an impetus of economic growth for the EU, China largest trade partner for the past decade, according to Chi. In 2014, the ChinaEU trade volume totaled 615.1 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 14.1 percent of China total trade volume and registering a 9.9 percent on growth. China and EU accounted for one third of the total size of the world economy, but the volume of their bilateral trade is only 1.5 percent of the world total. Stressing that there is much room for China and the EU to expand trade and economic cooperation, Chi  that if the trade between the two economies grows at an annual rate of 9 percent in the next , the bilateral trade volume will reach 1 trillion U.S. dollars in 2020.

Agence Europe All Rights Reserved Brussels, 27/02/2015 (Agence Europe) On Thursday 26 February, the EU called on the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel to examine the EU complaint about the tariff treatment Moscow applies to certain European goods in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors (DS 485). In this new dispute taken to the WTO against Russia, the EU criticises Moscow for applying customs duties to certain products that are above the bound rates which Russia committed not to exceed when it joined the WTO in 2012. The EU is targeting Russian duties applied to EU exports of paper and card, palm oil and its derivatives, refrigerators and fridge/freezers. Russia diverges in two ways from what was agreed when it joined the WTO: either it applies a higher customs duty of 15% (instead of 5%), or it sets a minimum amount that must be paid (even if this is not justified by the duty rate that was agreed, expressed as a percentage of the product value), the European Commission explains. These excessive customs duties have a negative impact on European exports of the three products concerned, which are worth approximately 600 million per . At the end of October 2014, the EU had asked for WTO consultations on this issue, but the consultations which were held on 28 November did not enable the dispute to be resolved. This new dispute setting the EU as complainant against Russia, is the fourth since 2012, following on from disputes about a Russian recycling tax on vehicles (DS 462), Russian measures targeting pork imports (DS 479) and a Russian tax on light vehicles (DS 479).

       " \"Departure of WTO Agricultural Chair Could Complicate Doha Negotiations By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 2, 2015 Feb. 27— The top mediator of the World Trade Organization agriculture negotiations is expected to leave Geneva this summer, and his departure may complicate the organization effort to conclude the 2001 Doha Round, according to sources in Geneva. Ambassador John Adank will soon notify the WTO General Council of his intent to vacate the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in Special Session so that he may return to New Zealand. Adank four term has already been extended once and is unlikely to be further extended, Geneva trade sources told Bloomberg BNA. His departure may disrupt the continuity of the WTO delicate negotiations to liberalize agriculture rules and could exacerbate the challenge of resolving the Doha Development Agenda, the sources . Though many expect Adank to leave Geneva in August, it is unclear when, exactly, he will relinquish his position and who might replace him as chairman of the Agriculture Committee in Special Session. Adank transition plans have not yet been made public, and he declined to comment for this story. PostBali Work Program News of Adank forthcoming departure comes as WTO members continue their efforts to advance a detailed work program to address the remaining issues of the 2013 Bali Ministerial Conference by July 31. If a work program is successfully developed by mid, it could lead to broader outcomes at the WTO 10th Ministerial Conference scheduled for Dec. 15–18 in Nairobi, Kenya. However, stark disagreements about the elements of the work program have led some members to believe that the July 31 milestone is an unattainable goal and may have to be extended to December. The introduction of a new agricultural negotiating committee chairman could further disrupt the timeline of the work program, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA. Some observers in Geneva perceive the work of the agricultural negotiating committee as perhaps the most pivotal element in achieving actionable results this . Several members have  that any ambition in the nonagricultural market access and services negotiations will be linked to the achievements, or lack thereof, in the agricultural negotiations committee. Quietly Effective Adank, a nearly 30 veteran of New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has led the WTO agriculture negotiations since 2011. He succeeded David Walker, who subsequently became a deputy secretary at New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Adank maintained an excellent reputation in what is considered a difficult role at the WTO, according to Geneva trade officials. He is known for his attention to detail and ability to balance the political sensitivities of agriculture negotiations while helping members find a way forward on some of the WTO thorniest issues. “John has done a great job,” WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told Bloomberg BNA. “He is knowledgeable and has the respect of everybody in the organization. This is what happens, guys come and then they get called home.” He is recognized as key figure in ushering the outcomes of the 2013 Bali Ministerial Conference, and quietly helped address some of India concerns about WTO rules regarding public stockholding for food security purposes. In 2014, he provided a supportive role in coordinating the bilateral negotiations between India and the U.S. that ultimately led members to approve the Trade Facilitation Agreement, the WTO first trade accord in 20 . This , Adank held multiple consultations with committee members aimed at addressing domestic support and market access issues. The earlystage negotiations have been slow, and members such as the U.S., India and China have been unable to find consensus on the viability of the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4). Selection Process Once Adank notifies the General Council of his intent to leave, members will initiate a selection process for the next chairman that will be coordinated by WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo, who is also the chairman of the Trade Negotiation Committee. In the past, representatives from the WTO secretariat office have coordinated committee work in the absence of a fulltime chair. Though the transition from one negotiating committee chair to another won't necessarily jeopardize the WTO work, the selection of a replacement chair could slow the negotiations further and potentially disrupt the WTO goals for 2015. There have been instances when previous WTO chairmen became unpopular with members and the committee work suffered. As a result, members thoroughly vet chair replacements to ensure that they receive the broadest possible acceptance. Objectivity, Confidentiality Essential Typically, candidates to lead the various negotiating groups are evaluated for their ability to mediate discussions among members without influencing the process in favor of their national interests. The last four chairmen of the agriculture negotiations committee have come from New Zealand, whose public officials have a reputation for neutrality in agriculture negotiations. The primary role of the agriculture negotiations chair is to facilitate discussions among members. The role often vacillates between being a sounding board for members and acting as a matchmaker between delegations that disagree over a particular issue. A high degree of trust and respect for the confidentiality of delegates' negotiating positions is generally considered necessary for negotiating chairs to be successful. Negotiating committee chair must also help to keep delegations informed about the status of certain bilateral discussions and clarify any misinformation circulating among members.\",\n",
       " \"Discussions to Continue on Agriculture, Market Access at World Trade Organization WTO Reporter, March 2, 2015 By Bryce Baschuk Feb. 27 — The World Trade Organization Negotiating Group on Market Access is scheduled to meet March 2 to discuss member proposals to reduce trade tariffs. The chairman of the negotiating group, Remigi Winzap of Switzerland,  the success of the negotiations will be determined by members' level of ambition, their willingness to offer concessions, their ability to accept differentiated tariff profiles and the impact of ongoing plurilateral negotiations, according to a report recently circulated among members. Winzap noted that the level of trust among members is insufficient “for a discussion around concrete alternative concepts” and urged members to increase their bilateral negotiations. “Members are hesitant to come up with concrete proposals as such proposal could be killed on arrival,” Winzap report . WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo subsequently urged members to offer more concrete proposals if they are to achieve progress in their goal of advancing a detailed postBali work program by July 31, according to his speech at the Feb. 20 General Council meeting. Regular Agriculture Meeting Members are expected to discuss India public stockholding programs and U.S. agriculture policies at a pair of WTO Agriculture Committee meetings scheduled for March 4–5. The U.S. recently asked India for more details about its domestic food security programs as part of a Feb. 20 inquiry document. Last , the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes nearly sank the Trade Facilitation Agreement when India asked for a definite extension of a peace clause to preserve its programs from international scrutiny. The Agriculture Committee is tasked with evaluating how countries comply with their commitments on subsidies and market access. The committee will also review the negotiations being discussed in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture. Azevedo in Brazil Azevedo plans to meet with government representatives in Brasilia this week. He also plans to meet with Robson Andrade, the president of Brazil National Confederation of Industry. On March 6, there will be a meeting of the working party on the accession of Azerbaijan to the WTO. Azerbaijan working party was established in 1997 and has met 11 times since 2002. At the last meeting of the working party, members sought further clarifications on Azerbaijan tax exemptions, investment incentives, operation of foreignowned enterprises, privatizations, technical barriers to trade, subsidies, transit system and intellectual property rights regime.\",\n",

Container demand rose by about 4 per cent in both 2013 and 2014 and Maersk Line, the Danish group that ships about 15 per cent of the world’s seaborne freight, expects it to increase 3 to 5 per cent this . “I’m personally more towards the low end of that,” Søren Skou, Maersk Line’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “Growth from a historical perspective is quite sluggish. It has a huge impact for us as an industry.” Mr Skou called the halving of oil prices in the past  “a net positive for container growth” but nonetheless  the opposing forces were potentially greater. “The economies in Europe are still very sluggish. Brazil, Russia and China: those three economies used to drive a lot of growth, and right now we are not really seeing that to the same extent. The only real bright spot is the US, and even the US is good but not great,” he added. His comments have weight as Maersk’s predictions are seen as a good indicator of global trade as it carries goods and products between Asia, Europe, the US, Africa and Latin America. Container demand used to expand at up to 10 per cent a  before the financial crisis, but Mr Skou  those days were behind the industry. He  that rise in demand would more closely mirror global GDP growth now. He  that it was always hard to interpret the first quarter because of the Chinese new  but added: “To my mind volumes were sluggish. There is nothing in container volume numbers that suggest that the global economy is just on the verge of starting a new growth trend.” In a 4 per cent environment capacity decisions take on a different perspective if you get it wrong. The good old days aren’t coming back Søren Skou, Maersk Line’s chief executive The lower growth poses problems for an industry where Maersk Line is the only solidly profitable company with dozens of lossmaking ones, and where new capacity outstrips increases in volume. “Before if you acquired too much capacity you could kind of work your way out of it. In a 4 per cent environment capacity decisions take on a different perspective if you get it wrong. The good old days aren’t coming back,” he added. Despite the warning, Maersk is about to order new ships for the first time since 2011 when it bought 20 Triple Es, then the world’s largest vessels capable of transporting the equivalent of 18,000 20foot containers. Mr Skou  a decision would be made between April and June with the likelihood that more Triple Es would be ordered, possibly slightly modified to take up to 20,000 containers.

       " 'Call for WTO ban on India sugar subsidy 2 March 2015 Bangkok Post The Thai Sugar Millers Corporation Limited (TSMC) has urged the Thai government to seek a World Trade Organization (WTO) action to stop an India sugar export subsidy because it hurts major regional sugar exporters, including Thailand and Australia. TSMC chairman Sirivuth Siamphakdee sent a letter to the Commerce Ministry Trade Negotiation Department outlining the request. The subsidy makes India sugar prices unrealistically lower than market prices, he . \"The India export subsidy is completely distorting the market and is against WTO rules. It adversely affects world sugar prices, hurting other major sugar exporters including Thailand, which is the world secondbiggest sugar exporter. So we urged our government to do something to stop India from subsidising exports,\"  Mr Sirivuth. In 2014, the India government started subsidising raw sugar exports by paying a \"marketing and promotion services\" fee to exporters of 3,300 rupees per tonne, or around US$54 (1,750 baht), making India sugar cheaper than its competitors. India exported 4 million tonnes last , or around 2% of total sugar consumption across Asia. He  this eroded the market share of Thailand and Australia, which exported 7 million and 4 million tonnes, respectively. India has subsidised 1.4 million tonnes of sugar exports this , increasing its subsidy rate to 4,000 rupees a tonne. Traders  the sugar subsidy had put pressure on global sugar prices, which have fallen by more than half from a record high of 36 cents per lb. The New York raw sugar futures, which sets global price trends, recently moved in a range of 1415 cents per lb. \"The India subsidy encouraged investment funds to liquidate contracts on the New York raw sugar market, influencing physical market prices to stay at a low level,\"  an industry official.',\n",

In the 201314, government subsidy bill stood at Rs 89,740.02 crore. The prebudget economic document also pointed that the \"food subsidy bill has increased substantially in the past few  putting severe strain on the public exchequer\". The Survey stated that food subsidy has gone up as the economic cost of wheat and rice has continuously increasing, but the issue price of the food grains under PDS has been kept unchanged since July 1, 2002. \"Rationalisation of subsidies and better targeting of beneficiaries would release resources for public investment in agriculture,\" it added. The prebudget economic document emphasised that agriculture and food sector needs huge investment in research, education, extension, irrigation, fertilisers, and laboratories to test soil, water and commodities, warehousing, coldstorage. The survey opines that the focus of public expenditure for agriculture so far has been on provision of subsidies, public expenditure in agriculture is only onefourth of expenditure towards food and fertiliser subsidies. It is time it shifted towards investments to boost productivity.',\n",

The Economic Survey, the basis for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 2015/16 budget on Saturday,  reform of the food subsidies required more work. India, the world biggest rice and wheat producer after China, runs a mammoth food welfare programme for the poor. The cost of the South Asian nation food subsidies for the fiscal  ending March 31 are estimated to surge a quarter to 1.15 trillion rupees ($18.6 billion) from the previous . The programme covers over 65 million poor families through the distribution of subsidised food via a network of 450,000 ration shops. The state run network aims at ensuring minimum nutritional support to the poor and stability in grain prices. The annual loss of 184 billion rupees ($2.98 billion) in subsidies for rice and wheat, the report , \"seriously\" undermines the effectiveness of distribution network. \"Leakages can be stopped by cash transfer of the subsidy amount directly to the bank account, but the biggest challenge is most of the poor in India do not have any accounts at all,\"  Veeresh Hiremath, research head of brokerage Karvy Comtrade. The report favoured a review of staterun grain procurement policies, especially in states that pay prices higher than minimum support levels for subsidised foods and impose high levies on the purchases. The review should be extended to policies on stocking and distribution as well, the report suggested.

       " 'China draft counterterror law strikes fear in foreign tech firms By Michael Martina and Krista Hughes BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) China is weighing a farreaching counterterrorism law that would require technology firms to hand over encryption keys and install security \"backdoors\", a potential escalation of what some firms view as the increasingly onerous terms of doing business in the world second largest economy. A parliamentary body read a second draft of the country first antiterrorism law this week and is expected to adopt the legislation in the coming weeks or months. The initial draft, published by the National People Congress late last , requires companies to also keep servers and user data within China, supply law enforcement authorities with communications records and censor terrorismrelated internet content. Its scope reaches far beyond a recently adopted set of financial industry regulations that pushed Chinese banks to purchase from domestic technology vendors. The implications for Silicon Valley companies, ranging from Microsoft to Apple Inc, have set the stage for yet another confrontation over cybersecurity and technology policy, a major irritant in U.S.China relations. \"It a disaster for anyone doing business in China,\"  one industry source. \"You are no longer allowed a VPN that secure, you are no longer able to transmit financials securely, or to have any corporate secrets. By law, nothing is secure.\" The Obama administration has conveyed its concerns about the antiterrorism draft law to China, according to a U.S. official. Although the counterterrorism provisions would apply to both domestic and foreign technologies, officials in Washington and Western business lobbies argue the law, combined with the new banking rules and a slew of antitrust investigations, amount to unfair regulatory pressure targeting foreign companies. \"The true test will come with implementation,\"  Scott Kennedy, the Director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"Given the recent spate of AMLrelated (antimonopoly law) cases against foreign firms, the regulations about the banking sector, and the reduction of foreign firms\\' products on government procurement lists, there is good reason for foreign firms to be highly concerned,\" Kennedy . PROTECTIONISM, NOT SECURITY? To be sure, Western governments, including in the United States and Britain, have for  requested tech firms to disclose encryption methods, with varying degrees of success. Officials including FBI director James Comey and National Security Agency (NSA) director Mike Rogers publicly warned internet companies including Apple and Google late last  against using encryption that law enforcement cannot break. Beijing has argued the need to quickly ratchet up its cybersecurity measures in the wake of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revelations of sophisticated U.S. spying techniques. In December, China banking regulator adopted new rules that outlined security criteria that tech products in 68 categories must meet in order to be considered \"secure and controllable\" for use in the financial sector, according to a version of the regulations seen by Reuters. To attain the designation, source code powering operating systems, database software and middleware must be registered with the government if they are not domestically developed. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman issued a statement on Thursday criticizing the banking rules, saying they \"are not about security – they are about protectionism and favoring Chinese companies\". \"The Administration is aggressively working to have China walk back from these troubling regulations,\" Froman . A U.S. official confirmed a letter was sent by Froman, America top trade negotiator, and other senior officials to Chinese counterparts expressing their concerns. James Zimmerman, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China,  the latest rules, if implemented, would likely limit opportunities for U.S. companies, but could also backfire on China. \"One unfortunate consequence of overbroad antiterrorism policies is to potentially isolate China technologically from the rest of the world, and the end result of that may be to limit the country access to cuttingedge technology and innovation,\" Zimmerman . But several U.S. technology executives and industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity  they feared the security law would be more stringent than the bank regulations – and more sensitive to discuss because it was rooted in public security considerations. The vague, openended requirements for cooperating with law enforcement appeared the most worrying, as well as the possibility of steep penalties or jail time for noncompliance, according to one executive. \"It the equivalent of the Patriot Act on really, really strong steroids,\"  one U.S. industry source, referring to the antiterrorism legislation enacted under the George W. Bush administration following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The National People Congress did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Apple and Google declined to comment on the proposed law, while Microsoft was not immediately available for comment. China is drafting the antiterrorism law at a time when Chinese leaders say the country faces a serious threat from religious extremists and separatists. Hundreds of people have been killed over the past two  in the far western region of Xinjiang in unrest the government has blamed on Islamists who want to establish a separate state called East Turkestan.

There are quite straightforward rues of the World Trade Organization. And Russia, as a WTO member, cannot choose: we cannot impose sanctions against EU member states and selectively lift sanctions on one of the countries. In this case it would be possible to develop a scheme of nondirect supplies, such as imports of raw materials with an investment into Russiabased food processing facilities, Peskov told Russian daily Izvestiya. In August, Russia was forced to respond to sanctions introduced by the West over Moscow alleged role in the Ukrainian crisis with a ban on certain food imports from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway.

The trade ministers of member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathered for their annual retreat in Kota Bharu, the capital of Malaysia northeastern Kelantan state, to chart the way forward for the grouping as it is poised to mark the formal establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community by end of this . Under the AEC blueprint, the grouping with a combined population of over 625 million people envisions an integrated market and production base with free flow of goods, services and investments, skilled labor and capital. It aims to boost intraASEAN trade further. In 2013, trade between ASEAN members amounted to $608.6 billion, accounting for 24.2 percent of total trade in the region. It was a 32.9 percent increase from the $458.1 billion recorded in 2008 when the AEC blueprint was first launched. \"The implementation of the AEC measures does not mean that ASEAN will become a single economic entity by Jan. 1, 2016, rather it sends a strong signal that positive measures have been put in place towards a more liberalized and integrated economic region,\" the ministers  in a statement at the end of the oneday retreat. At present, ASEAN members have substantially eliminated custom import duties and beginning 2015, 97.3 percent of the products traded in the region are dutyfree. The focus for the , they added, will be on removing further nontariff barriers that impede trade, such as simplification of custom procedures, harmonization of standards, further liberalization of services and trade facilitation. At a joint press conference, ASEAN Deputy SecretaryGeneral for ASEAN Economic Community Lim Hong Hin illustrated some of the common problems like multiple testing required for a product by different countries in the region and labeling requirements such as the use of local language. Some of these have been resolved but there were still cases cropping up. Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Mustapa Mohamed who chaired the retreat  they have identified 69 nontariff barriers and have resolved 45. \"We are committed to see more progress in the (removal) of nontariff barriers,\" he . Meanwhile, Mustapa  the negotiation for a trade pact between ASEAN and its six regional partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea is on track for conclusion by the end of this . The eighth round of talks for the initiative known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will be held in June in Kyoto, western Japan. Before that, some of the negotiating committees will hold a smaller \"intersessional\" meeting in April in Jakarta, Indonesia, he added. RCEP is touted as the largest free trade deal as it will cover half the world population and almost 30 percent of the global economy. \"We will make sure that the deadline of end (of) 2015 is achieved,\" Mustapa . \"The closer economic integration will make ASEAN an attractive region to do business.\" The ministers also discussed concerns over the impact of falling oil prices for netoil exporting economies in ASEAN like Indonesia and currency volatility including possible capital flow reversal. \"This is where the implementation of ASEAN regional economic integration can help member states overcome the challenges posed by global economic volatility,\" the ministers  in the statement. \"We expect ASEAN economic performance to improve in 2015 to 5.1 percent, above the 3.5 percent global growth projection. We based this on the stronger demand in advanced economies, energized by the robust U.S. recovery and several policy stimulus measures in the Eurozone and Japan,\" the ministers added.

       " \"WTO Members Reluctant to Issue Proposals on Market Access Because of Trust Deficit By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 3, 2015 March 2 — World Trade Organization members  a lack of trust has led them to avoid introducing concrete proposals to determine how members can reduce tariffs as part of their market access negotiations. Their reluctance stems from the fear that as soon as a proposal is introduced it would be rejected without consideration, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA. Members reiterated this point at a March 2 meeting of the Negotiating Group on Market Access. “As long as there are no new proposals on the table, members will continue to repeat their known positions,” wrote Remigi Winzap, chairman of the Market Access Negotiating Group, in his recent report to members. The development marks another hurdle in members' goal of producing a detailed work program by July 31 aimed at concluding the Doha round of trade negotiations. Stark Differences Remain Over the past two months, members have failed to reach consensus in the various discussions to address the remaining issues of the 2013 Bali Ministerial conference, namely the modernization of WTO rules regarding agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services. The body agricultural negotiations have proven to be particularly troublesome for members like the U.S., China and India, who cannot to agree on the best way to modify to their domestic agricultural subsidy programs. Members at the March 2 meeting  NAMA negotiations, which cover all products not included in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, couldn't be viewed in isolation from the other negotiation areas, particularly agriculture. Members of the Negotiating Group on Market Access will continue their discussions in smaller groups and await the introduction of formal proposals. Request/Offer Proposal Argentina suggested a request/offer proposal whereby members send requests directly to each other indicating what improvements they are seeking in the realm of tariff reductions. Under such an approach members would specify in their initial offers how and to what extent they are willing to make binding commitments in response to such requests. Argentina has yet to issue a formal written proposal on its request/offer modality. The offer is intended to replace the socalled Swiss formula, which aims to harmonize tariff cuts via mathematical formulas. Though many members prefer the Swiss formula it is consider “extremely difficult” for some, Winzap  in his report. NTB Discussion Members of the Negotiating Group on Market Access did not reach any new conclusions in their discussion of nontariff barriers (NTBs) at the March 2 meeting. The committee is seeking to identify, categorize and examine various NTBs—which include any measure other than a tariff that protects domestic industry—with the goal of improving market access for members. The discussions currently lack sufficient traction among members to warrant further negotiations in the near term, Geneva trade officials .\",\n",

Members of the Negotiating Group on Rules decided there was little point in reviewing the history of the group negotiations in a stocktaking session, as proposed by Japan on behalf of the Friends of AntiDumping Negotiations group. Australia, which completed a major overhaul of its domestic antidumping rules last , suggested that such a discussion would be counterproductive. The U.S. supported the Australian intervention and urged members to focus their efforts on negotiations related to agriculture, nonagricultural market access and services. In the absence of agreement on a stocktaking session, the European Union proposed that the WTO secretariat produce background notes on the rules issues and also conduct briefing sessions with members to get them up to speed.

Members, who have been warning that sugar export subsidies go against India’s WTO commitments since last , have stepped up pressure and asked for details of payouts in 2014. “The matter will come up for discussion at the WTO’s Committee of Agriculture meeting later this week,” an official at the WTO told BusinessLine. Late last month, the government raised the export subsidy for raw sugar from Rs. 3,300 a tonne (announced last February for 2014) to Rs. 4,000 for 2015 season for up to 1.4 million tonnes (mt) of sugar. The subsidy for 2014 had lapsed last September. Interestingly, India had informed the WTO last November that although it had approved export subsidies for sugar in February, it had not paid any subsidies till that time. Challenging the Centre’s claim, Australia  that if indeed the sugar export subsidy programme was unfunded and no incentives were being paid, India should explain the rationale behind the bimonthly review, the adjusted rates and continuation of the programme. “If subsidy payments have been made… can India provide the total value of export subsidy budgetary outlays as well as the volume and value of raw sugar exports that have been subject to incentive payments?” the Australian representative to the WTO stated in a representation prior to the CoA meeting. Colombia  it was worried about media reports on the increase in export subsidy for sugar in India as it could distort world prices. “Colombia is concerned about the impact that these statements are having on the world sugar market, which is exacerbated by the fact that India is the world third largest exporter of sugar,” the country’s representation stated. The idea behind the export subsidies is to help sugar millers reduce their rising domestic stocks and pay sugarcane farmers their dues. According to estimates made by the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) earlier this , cane arrears across the country could cross last ’s peak of over Rs. 13,000 crore. The EU, in its representation,  that India should explain how the reactivation of sugar export subsidies, complies with its export subsidy commitments. According to industry estimates, mills are expected to produce a record 26 mt of sugar in the 201415 season in addition to a carryover stock of 7.5 mt. Domestic sugar consumption is pegged at between 24.7 and 24.8 mt.',\n",

Both are still in the drafting process, but could begin to take effect this month. Business lobby groups have asked the Obama administration and the European Commission to raise the issue in bilateral trade talks with Beijing. They suspect that the new rules, which Chinese government officials say are needed to address legitimate national security concerns, are in fact aimed at boosting China own tech companies. Four US cabinet secretaries have written a letter to their Chinese counterparts about the issue, according to people familiar with the diplomatic exchange. In a statement last week, US trade representative Michael Froman also argued that the new regulations \"go directly against a series of China bilateral and multilateral trade commitments\".

Why then, do young people know very little about the intricacies and benefits of world trade? \"A recent poll in the EU found that those in the age range 1524 were more positive about trade than any other age group\" In recent  we have seen vociferous opposition to free trade, making it a scapegoat for many ills. However, it appears that it is the older generations who are more antitrade than their younger counterparts. A recent poll in the EU found that those in the age range 1524 were more positive about trade than any other age group. Policymakers clearly need to listen more to this generation of future entrepreneurs. We must highlight those benefits in real terms, such as poverty reduction and new jobs, not in statistical GDP growth figures. Nowhere is this truer than among the younger people of Europe. We know that trade is an enabler. The recent EUKorea free trade agreement has seen EU exports to Korea increase by 30 per cent. So I believe it is time the WTO makes this argument in a more robust, confident way. This was the message that I took a few weeks ago to the WTO interparliamentary meeting in Geneva. I believe the WTO should be engaging far more strongly in the argument and reaching out. We need young advocates for trade: human faces, not technocrats. Using tomorrow communication tools, not yesterday. Communication must also be matched by action so that the WTO meets the challenges of the modern world. Outdated trade rules are a source of frustration for young people who regularly cross borders. They seek opportunities, but are too often let down. A good place to begin is the recognition of professional qualifications so that young people can trade their skills across borders. We also need clearer information when buying products from abroad about the possible import tariffs that might be added. These nasty shocks discourage people from taking advantage of the global marketplace. If they cannot be reduced, they should at least be made transparent. However, the WTO can\\'t do this alone. They can\\'t do it without the help of national governments and their parliaments to ensure that the voice of young people is heard. And we should look at how education systems can give a greater understanding of how international trade works. We can sell the benefits of trade to young people. We need to communicate, educate, facilitate and inspire. In many ways the WTO is similar to many of the world young entrepreneurs. It has an idea to sell to a competitive market. It must take advantage of the very same technologies and mediums that its rules have helped to create. Just like any other ambitious 20  old, it should have faith that it has the right ideas to change the world for the better. We need to go out there and win the argument.

       " \"Reding Says U.S. ECommerce Proposal Falls Short On Privacy Protections Posted: March 03, 2015 World Trade Online The U.S. ecommerce proposal in the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) negotiations fails to provide adequate protections for European Union citizens data because it does not contain exceptions for privacy or national security purposes, according to the European Parliament lead lawmaker on the issue. Viviane Reding, the parliament TISA rapporteur,  in a Feb. 27 interview with Inside U.S. Trade that any rule in TISA aiming to guarantee the free flow of data across borders must be tempered by protections for privacy and allow participants to take exceptions for national security. This stands in contrast to the U.S. proposal, which would establish broad rights for private service suppliers to transfer information including personal data into and out of a party territory, as long as it is in connection with the conduct of the firm business, without exceptions. “We Europeans believe that there are three blocks of questions that need to be treated together,” Reding . “This is, of course, free flow of data, companies need that, linked together with the protection of personal data, linked together with [a] national security exemption with objective necessity criteria.” “The three must go together in order to allow the whole thing to function, in order to allow companies to exchange, citizens to feel secure, and national security to act under the rule of law when necessary,” she added. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Holleyman who oversees services, investment, and intellectual property issues at USTR last month signaled that the U.S. ecommerce proposal faces pushback, saying that reaching a consensus on the issue will be difficult. The U.S. has sought to include its ecommerce proposal on the agenda for the April 1317 negotiating round hosted by the EU, as part of an effort to drive progress on a more limited range of issues, but the EU has thus far been cool to the idea. Reding  that the agenda for the round is still being negotiated. Her comments this week echo one she made in a December hearing at the European Parliament with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, where Reding  the U.S. proposal was unacceptable. In her visit to Washington, Reding met with members of the House Ways & Means subcommittee on trade, where her discussions focused mainly on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). On TTIP, she argued that it is imperative the U.S. and EU rebuild trust that has deteriorated with contentions that the U.S. government has been spying in the EU. She  that in order for any negotiations including TISA to move forward, the two partners would have to agree on bilateral data protection agreements including Safe Harbor and the socalled “Umbrella Agreement” governing data transfers between the U.S. and EU for law enforcement purposes. Reding  that she raised this issue with U.S. lawmakers and made them aware of the two agreements. TISA however, is not on Congress' radar, she . Reding  the parliament will shift its focus to TISA in the second half of the  in hopes of passing a resolution establishing the offensive and defensive interests of the EU. As the rapporteur, she is in charge of coordinating the parliament position on the issue. One of those offensive interests, outlined by Reding in a Jan. 13 press conference on TISA, is to include China in the negotiations. But Reding moderated her position in the interview, saying that China should join only after the “bulk of likeminded countries” currently in the negotiations reach an agreement or come very close to it. “We have still to advance a lot in the negotiations. 70 percent of the world trade [in services] is sitting around the table ready to negotiate, so that is a very big bulk and this bulk of likeminded countries has to somehow bring this negotiation to completion, nearly,” she . “Then we have to see who else can join, but not reopen the negotiations, or stop the negotiations, or delay.” That puts her at odds with the European Commission, which wants to bring China into the negotiations as soon as possible. The U.S., meanwhile, has been vocal about its opposition to China joining the talks a position supported by Japan and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The U.S. fears allowing China into the negotiations could risk the stalling of talks, similar to what happened in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) expansion effort. Reding, in the interview, signaled that she was at least somewhat sympathetic to the U.S. view in this regard. “You have to take into account these negative experiences,” she , referencing the ITA talks. The U.S. has  they would be open to China joining the negotiations if it first shows a commensurate level of ambition by concluding the ITA expansion, implementing an adverse World Trade Organization ruling on electronic payments, and by lowering barriers in the area of express delivery services.\",\n",
       " \"WTO Report Finds Doha Agricultural Subsidy Goals More Achievable Than Ever By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 4, 2015 March 3 — World Trade Organization members have significantly reduced tradedistorting domestic support levels since the 2001 Doha round began, according to a WTO report published March 3. The level of members' reductions in current total aggregate measurement of support (CTAMS) since 2001 “suggest that, from a policy perspective, fulfilling the Doha Round mandate on agricultural domestic support should be easier to achieve than in previous ,” the report . The goal of the paper, submitted by members of the Cairns Group, is intended to better inform members as to the current state of their respective agricultural trade policies. It comes amid intensifying efforts to modernize WTO agriculture rules in line with the goals of the Doha Development Agenda. Members of the WTO agriculture negotiating committee will likely consider the paper as part of their discussions at an informal meeting scheduled for March 6. Top 10 Agricultural Traders The report examined the domestic support data from 2001 to 2013 for the top 10 global traders of agriculture products, namely, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Russian Federation and the U.S. U.S. CTAMS declined dramatically from 2001 to 2011 from $14.5 billion to $4.7 billion, and then rebounded to $6.9 billion in 2012. The U.S. increased its green box support, defined as non–trade distorting agricultural domestic support, from $50.7 billion in 2001 to $127.4 billion in 2012. The U.S. did not use any blue box support—domestic support that is considered somewhat tradedistorting but has no WTO limits—during the sample period. Total U.S. support, defined as the sum of all other types of support, including aggregate measurements of support (AMS) that are de minimis, increased from $72.2 billion to $139.6 billion. The EU CTAMS also declined dramatically between 2001 and 2010 from $35.3 billion to $6.5 billion, the report . The EU increased its green box support from $18.5 billion to $88.7 billion. Blue box support decreased from $21.3 billion to $4.1 billion. Total support increased from $75.9 billion to $103.1 billion. BRIC Support Levels India levels of productspecific, tradedistorting domestic support increased steadily from 2001 to 2010. India support for products considered under Article 6.2 of the Agriculture Agreement, for which developing countries are to be given extra flexibility, increased sharply from $8.3 billion to $31.6 billion between 2001 and 2010. India green box support increased nearly fivefold in absolute terms from $4 billion to $19.5 billion. Total support increased from $12.3 billion in 2001 to $53.2 billion in 2010. China has no AMS commitment and does not have recourse to Article 6.2. China green box support more than doubled between 2001 and 2008 from $30.6 billion to $86 billion, the report . Total Chinese support increased from $30.9 billion in 2001 to $99.8 billion in 2008. The Russian Federation CTAMS increased from $2.9 billion in 2001 to $5.5 billion in 2009. Green box support increased from $1.1 billion to $2.2 billion during the same time period. Total support increased from $4.2 billion in 2001 to $7.8 billion in 2009. Brazil CTAMS increased from $0 in 2001 to $520 million in 2008 and then dropped back to $0 by 2013. Brazil green box support increased from $1.5 billion to $6.2 billion. Brazil Article 6.2 product support increased from $332 million to $1.1 billion. Total support increased from $2.8 billion in 2001 to $9.7 billion in 2012. Other Agriculture Leaders Australia CTAMS decreased from $158 million in 2001 to $0 in 2010, the report . Over the same period, green box support increased from $722 million to $1.8 billion. Total support increased from $887 million in 2001 to $1.8 billion in 2010. Japan CTAMS decreased from $6.1 billion in 2001 to $3.3 billion in 2007 and then increased steadily to $6.4 billion in 2012. Japan green box support decreased from $23.4 billion in 2001 to $15.1 billion in 2007 and then rebounded to $19.9 billion in 2012. Japan blue box support reached a low of $213 million in 2009, increased sharply to $3.1 billion in 2010 and then fell to around $1.6 billion in 2011 and in 2012. Total support decreased from $30.7 billion in 2001 to $19.6 billion in 2007 and then steadily increased to $30.3 billion in 2012. Canada CTAMS decreased from $1.9 billion in 2001 to $513 million in 2011, despite fluctuations in the intervening . Canada green box support more than doubled in absolute terms from $1.1 billion to $2.7 billion. Total support increased from $3.1 billion in 2001 to $5.7 billion in 2011. Indonesia has no AMS commitments. It is working to fill in certain gaps in its domestic support notifications relating to AMS, including providing information on its public stockholding programs, the report . Indonesia green box support increased from $241 million in 2001 to $3.6 billion in 2011. Levels of Indonesia Article 6.2 support increased from $0 to $1.9 billion. Total support increased from $241 million in 2001 to $5.4 billion in 2010. Better Data Required “The continual evolution of domestic support trends within and across members highlights the need for a dynamic and robust review process under the Committee on Agriculture based on timely and complete notifications,” the Cairns report . “Even among the top ten global traders of agriculture products the lack of complete and timely notifications hampers members' ability to observe current trends in domestic support,” it . China had only reported its domestic support notifications up to 2008; Russia had not filed its domestic support notifications since 2009; India and Australia had not filed notifications since 2010. “Despite recent efforts from some members, lack of compliance with notification obligations remains a serious impediment to the review process in the Committee on Agriculture,” the report . “The Cairns Group strongly urges all members to redouble their efforts to meet all notification requirements.”\",\n",

Both sides confirmed it would be the best option,\" the minister . He  that a couple of existing RussiaEU trade disputes could easily be settled out of court. The minister remark came several days after the European Union called for the establishment of a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel to help solve a dispute with Russia over \"excessive import duties.\" Brussels has repeatedly accused Moscow of not meeting the commitments it undertook since becoming a WTO member in 2012. In total, at least four disputes have been initiated by the European Union against Russia, its third largest trading partner, within WTO frameworks, according to the organization website. For its part, Russia has initiated two disputes with the WTO against the European Union. The first, filed in late 2013, concerns antidumping measures imposed by the European Union on several products imported from Russia, including ammonium nitrate and steel products. The second, initiated in April 2014 is over measures applied by the EU relating to the socalled Third Energy Package.',\n",

The Republic’s second chamber, the Seanad, passed the plain packaging law on Tuesday night, which also makes it illegal to sell cigarettes in lipstickstyle containers designed for female smokers. The public health (standardised packaging of tobacco) bill 2014 requires the removal of all industry marketing from tobacco packaging. It has now passed all stages of the Republic’s parliament. Ireland’s minister for children and youth affairs, James Reilly, : “The interests of public health will be served when children decide never to take up smoking in the first place and if smokers are persuaded to quit. We have a duty to prevent our children from being lured into a killer addiction. “Standardised packaging will strip away the illusions created by shiny, colourful cigarette packets and replace them with shocking images showing the real consequences of smoking.” Japan Tobacco International, the multinational that owns brands such as Silk Cut and Benson and Hedges, has warned it will go to court to challenge the new law. A spokesperson for JTI  that plain packaging is a disproportionate, unjustified and unlawful measure. But Reilly  the Fine GaelLabour coalition is prepared to take on any challenge from the tobacco giant. Antismoking group Ash Ireland  the ban was vital health legislation. Ash Ireland’s spokesman, Ross Morgan,  the government and opposition politicians should be complimented for pushing ahead with the ban despite threats of legal actions. “We would also expect that should the industry mount a legal challenge on any aspect of this health legislation it will be vigorously contested,” he . “Ash Ireland is firmly of the view that the successful implementation of this legislation here in Ireland will set the scene for others to follow in Europe as was the case with the workplace smoking legislation some 11  ago.” More than 5,200 people die in Ireland each  from the effects of smoking and more than €1bn (£730m) is spent by health services every  treating tobaccorelated disease. Ireland was the first country in the world to ban smoking in public places back in March 2004.

       " 'Algeria Must Address Opaque Regulation, Foreign Investment Restrictions, Says Rivkin By Brian Flood WTO Reporter, March 4, 2015 March 3 — The U.S. supports Algeria efforts to invite more foreign investment, but the country still faces a number of barriers to trade that must be addressed, Assistant Secretary of State Charles H. Rivkin  at a trade and investment conference in Algiers March 2. Rivkin is leading a weeklong trade and investment mission to North Africa. He is joined by representatives of 18 U.S. companies, including Boeing Co., the CocaCola Co., Dow Chemical Co. and Ford Motor Co., according to the National U.S.Arab Chamber of Commerce. Algeria is overly dependent on its hyrdocarbon sector, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices, Rivkin , and it needs to diversify and seek outside investment. However, the current regulatory environment in Algiers is opaque, which contributes to a “perception of commercial risk for foreign investors,” he . Rivkin also singled out the country “49/51” rule, which prohibits foreign investors from holding a majority stake in investment projects, as another challenge frequently raised by U.S. businesses. “But I am confident in the commitment of this government to break down many of these barriers, and I hear that commitment in my meetings with our Algerian partners,” Rivkin . He added that the U.S. stands ready to support this process. Rivkin also  that U.S. agencies including the ExportImport Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) are in place to support U.S. firms interested in entering the Algerian economy. OPIC recently financed the construction of a desalination plant built by General Electric, he , and “stands ready to invest even more in Algeria. Renewable energy, SME [small and mediumsized enterprise] financing, infrastructure, housing, tourism, healthcare and telecommunications are all sectors where OPIC has the capacity to expand.” Rivkin also expressed support for Algeria interest in joining the World Trade Organization. “The fact is, WTO members create more and better jobs, and membership could boost Algeria attractiveness for investment—something that the government has long recognized as a top priority,” he . Since 1995, the accession process for new WTO members has taken approximately 10  on average. Algeria applied for WTO accession in June 1987. A November 2014 report authored by WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo indicated that the 12th meeting of the working party on Algeria accession was held in 2014 and made good progress (228 WTO, 11/26/14). In February, Daniel Mullaney of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative visited Algeria for a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement discussion. According to Rivkin, this was the first such meeting in more than 11 , and the two sides discussed issues such as the investment climate and intellectual property protection. The Commerce Department is also leading a trade mission to Morocco, Algeria and Egypt March 4–12 to help U.S. firms in the safety and security industry find new business partners and customers in the region.',\n",

Some U.S. lawmakers are pushing for a currency chapter in the TransPacific Partnership, which officials say is nearly completed, partly due to concerns about a weak Japanese yen. But Japan deputy chief trade negotiator, Hiroshi Oe, told reporters there were no discussions about currency manipulation, and if the issue was brought to the table it would derail any agreement. \"In the actual negotiations (there is) no discussion at all,\" Oe told reporters at a briefing, when asked if there were talks on inserting a provision against currency manipulation in the agreement. \"If that is really brought to the table, I think that the end of the negotiations,\" he . Japan yen has slumped since late 2012, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power and started pursuing aggressive stimulus policies, worrying U.S. automakers like Ford Motor Co. There is scant evidence recently that either Japan or China, America top trading partners in Asia, are engaged in currency manipulation following decades of U.S. pressure to stop intervening in the market. Japan yen is weakening partly due to the same policies pursued by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The U.S. administration and other TPP partners have also warned against introducing currency into the deal. \"We simply don\\'t think that the forum in which you would have currency manipulation rules,\" Simon Newnham, ministercounsellor for trade at the Australian embassy in Washington,  at a Wilson Center event on Friday.',\n",

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  talks on the trade bill, seen as key to finalizing the 12nation TransPacific Partnership (TPP), were \"stuck\" over Democratic demands to allow unsatisfactory deals to be taken off the fast track. The bill would allow lawmakers to set negotiating objectives for trade deals in exchange for a yesorno vote, giving trading partners confidence Congress will not pick agreements apart. \"I can\\'t agree to something that is going to diminish the power of ... the fast track approach, that one of the difficulties we are having,\" Hatch told reporters. New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser  last week the TPP must be agreed by mid or face being overtaken by U.S. politics during the 2016 presidential campaign. Some Republicans have  they will not support the TPP if fast track is not passed before the deal closes. A sticking point in the congressional talks is whether to allow lawmakers to strip a deal they deem unsatisfactory of its special status, and how high to set the hurdle. \"Would it require a low or high number of senators in order to be able to reject a package?\"  Calman Cohen, who heads the Emergency Committee for American Trade, the main coordinating business group on TPP issues. The top Democrat on the Senate panel, Ron Wyden,  making trade negotiations transparent and subject to congressional oversight would dispel skepticism about trade. \"If you believe deeply in trade and you want more of it, you should want to get rid of all of this secrecy that makes the public so cynical about trade and you should want to have Congress be involved at every step of the way in the negotiations,\" he , declining to give details of the talks. Trade is a hard sell for many Democrats worried about the impact on jobs and a Democratic aide  Wyden stance aimed to maximize bipartisan support for the bill. \"Senator Wyden is looking for some good, 11th hour concessions that he can get to demonstrate to Democrats that he has gotten the best deal possible,\" the aide .

       " 'African Nations Say Tide Has Turned Against Ebola By Naftali Bendavid 3 March 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News BRUSSELSLeaders of the three most heavily Ebolastricken African nations  Tuesday the tide had turned against the epidemic, with weekly infections falling roughly from 1,000 to 100, but warned against declaring victory prematurely. The presidents of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, concerned that attention will now drift from West Africa, stressed at a Brussels summit that future crises would be likely without ongoing attention and investment. The primary mood at the gathering, hosted by the European Union and Belgium, was relief at the apparent fading of a horrific epidemic that has killed more than 9,500 people. The three nations  they would seek to reach zero infections by April 15. The gathering was the highestlevel international meeting since the Ebola epidemic began at the beginning of 2014, and that itself signaled a newfound confidence that the epidemic was increasingly under control. \"Victory against the virus is in sight, but we must guard against complacency,\"  President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone. \"There won\\'t be complete victory until we get to a resilient zero in each of the three affected countries.\" The goal is to have zero new cases for 42 days to be sure the epidemic is fully over. Despite the 90% drop in new infections from last fall peak, medical workers are frustrated that the number of new cases has remained at about 100 a week for the past month. The new infections are often in remote villages whose residents distrust medical and aid workers, experts . Adding to the concern, some of those cases aren\\'t connected to alreadyknown Ebola patients but amount to new flareups. \"It is the fact that there are these random cases that is extremely concerning,\"  one EU official. Leaders from Europe, Asia and the U.S. joined their African counterparts Tuesday in warning against a premature departure from the field. \"Nothing would be more dangerous than to say, \\'This crisis is over and let move on to the day after,\\'\"  Christos Stylianides, the EU Ebola coordinator. Still, the African presidents  it was time to switch from emergency response to a recovery and rebuilding phase. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone had been on promising economic paths after decades of turmoil, only to see that trajectory disrupted by the Ebola outbreak in early 2014. Over the past , the countries\\' health care systems have all but collapsed and the region has lost 12% of its GDP. Schools have closed; Sierra Leone 1.7 million children still haven\\'t been to school in the past six months. But Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who visited Washington last week and discussed the Ebola outbreak with President Barack Obama  \"today we can report significant progress in containing the virus,\" adding that \"economic activity is gradually returning.\" The African leaders made it clear that they cannot just resume where they left off, given the devastation caused by Ebola. \"We really need a postEbola Marshall Plan,\"  Togo Prime Minister Kwesi AhoomeyZunu, representing the Economic Community of West African States. The three recovering countries are drawing up an economic plan in preparation for the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The African leaders also noted that donor nations have pledged $4.9 billion but released only $2.4 billion of that, and they appealed to the countries to provide the remaining funds. Several experts noted that vaccines and other treatments are currently undergoing trials, with some promising developments. But beyond Ebola, they , the world must improve at fighting epidemics in general. When it came to Ebola, \"the world was illprepared. It shows,\"  Margaret Chan, directorgeneral of the World Health Organization. \"We must reduce this vulnerability as a matter of urgency.\" Tuesday meeting attracted about 600 delegates from countries including China, Cuba and the U.S. The U.S. has provided about $1 billion to fight Ebolafocusing on Liberia, with which it has historic ties. The United Nations also has played a major role. African leaders, while applauding the progress, stressed the difficulty of the final stretch. \"It is easier to move from 100 to 10 than from 10 to zero,\"  President Alpha Conde of Guinea, referring to new cases. \"If we have one single case in any of the three countries, you can\\'t say we have beaten the disease.\" END ________________________________',\n",
       " \"WTO Trade Deal Will Likely Enter into Force By December Meeting, Says USTR Official By Brian Flood WTO Reporter, March 5, 2015 March 4 — The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) will likely enter into force by the time of the next World Trade Organization ministerial conference in Kenya in December, though it will take “a lot of legwork,” Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for WTO and Multilateral Affairs Mark Linscott  during a panel discussion. Each country has its own domestic ratification process, and some countries such as Japan will require legislative approval, which tends to take longer, Linscott  during the discussion hosted by the Washington International Trade Association. Nevertheless, he , a December goal is consistent with the history of previous WTO agreements, and many member countries are eager to begin the process of implementing the agreement by the next ministerial conference. The agreement will only enter into force when it has been domestically ratified by twothirds of WTO members. In 2014, the WTO was delayed for almost six months in its plans to open up the TFA for ratification, owing to India demands relating to the issue of food security. Richard Eglin, of White & Case LLP and a former director of the WTO Secretariat, recently  that the WTO original deadline of July 2015 to begin implementing the agreement is now “completely implausible” (39 WTO, 2/27/15). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) stands ready to assist any other countries that might need help in drafting such ratification legislation,  Virginia Brown, director of USAID Office of Trade and Regulatory Reforms. The agency has already been assisting developing countries to assess which TFA commitments they will be able to implement immediately, and which ones will require more time and donor countries' aid, she . U.S. Wants Swift Ratification Linscott  that the U.S. is pushing for swift TFA ratification at meetings of international fora such as the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation and the G20. Ralph Carter, managing director of trade and international affairs for FedEx Express,  the TFA will be one of the most costeffective policy reforms that any country can undertake to improve its global economic competitiveness, attract foreign investment and accelerate its development. In particular, Carter , it will help small and mediumsize enterprises to export, as complicated customs procedures are one of the biggest challenges to small businesses looking to expand their operations abroad. Yet it is one thing for a country to ratify the agreement on paper, and another for it to effectively implement the deal requirements,  Linscott, and full implementation of all provisions will take some time. Linscott  that donor countries' assistance to developing countries will grow as the latter demonstrate their political commitment to implementing the TFA reforms. Linscott called on the private sector to provide insights on how implementation actually affects the movement of goods across borders in practice, and to work with their counterparts in other countries to put pressure on their own governments to implement the deal. USAID is partnering with business representatives, as well as with five other donor countries, to organize a trade facilitation alliance to ensure a continued dialogue between governments and the private sector.\",\n",
       " 'Paraguay Circulates WTO Agricultural Market Access Proposal By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 5, 2015 March 4 — Paraguay proposed new tariff cuts aimed at fulfilling the Doha Round goal of expanding market access for agricultural products. The proposal, which circulated this week in Geneva, suggested that developed countries could apply, in six equal annual installments, a maximum average cut of 54 percent and minimum cut of 20 percent per tariff line. Under the proposal developing countries could apply, in 11 equal annual installments, maximum average tariff cuts of 54 percent and a minimum cut of 15 percent per tariff line. Small and vulnerable economies and new WTO members could offer a maximum average cut of 24 percent. Members of the WTO Agriculture Negotiating Committee will likely consider the proposal as part of their discussions at an informal meeting scheduled for March 6. Special Products Paraguay suggested that developed countries could apply a minimum 10 percent cut for no more than 5 percent of tariff lines considered to be sensitive products. Developing countries could under the proposal offer a minimum 10 percent cut for no more than 12 percent of tariff lines considered to be special products. The proposal  that members could not offer bound tariffs over a threshold of 100 percent for developed countries and 130 percent for developing countries. After the initial offers are submitted, members could enter a twomonth negotiation period whereby they may exchange requests on a bilateral or plurilateral basis. Members should take into account the provisions for tariff escalation in line with the 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4), the proposal . Modalities are formulas for various outcomes, including reducing tariffs and tradedistorting remedies, last revised in 2008. Helpful Proposal Geneva trade officials  that Paraguay proposal was helpful in getting members to focus on concrete ideas aimed at expanding agricultural market access terms, according to interviews with Bloomberg BNA. John Adank, chairman of the Agriculture Negotiating Committee, previously chided members for repeating old talking points and offering vague views regarding market access during the committee Jan. 28 meeting(40 WTO, 3/2/15).

The move was expected after Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders  a deal was pending on Friday, when the company announced full results in Munich. An Airbus spokesman  Wednesday that the company welcomes the agreement. The loan runs until 2031 and up to 1,500 deliveries, the ministry . Talks between Airbus and Berlin on the second loan broke down ahead of federal elections in Germany in 2013 amid acrimony between the company and the government over guaranteed work and jobs. According to the ministry spokeswoman, the two parties came to agreement late last , and Germany parliamentary budget committee approved the payment on Wednesday. Airbus, the commercial aerospace unit of Airbus GroupNV, has received billions of euros in preferential loans from European governments to support the development of new jetliner models over the past four decades. That included an initial EUR500 million loan from Germany for the A350. The process on agreeing a second loan, for EUR623 million, proved protracted because Airbus Group, formerly European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., balked at the terms demanded by the German government. The issue of loans for new planes has been controversial as the U.S. and Europe battle at the World Trade Organization over subsidies given to their respective plane makers. The WTO has  both Boeing Co. and Airbus have received subsidies not compliant with international trade agreements.',\n",

Resumption of the trilateral talks on the effect on the Russian economy of the EUUkraine association agreement and its trade chapter is part of the peace agreement concluded between Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine in Minsk on 12 February, ahead of the cessation of hostilities in the east of Ukraine. “I place great importance on our trade and investment relationship with Russia, and it is in our mutual interest to overcome the current difficulties. It is only via a solution to the Ukraine crisis that we can lay down the foundations for a renewed bilateral partnership”, the commissioner . The EU is expected very shortly to propose a date to Russia and Ukraine for the resumption of trilateral technical talks, prior to an early return to political discussions, a Community source close to this matter told us on Tuesday. Malmström also called on Russia, against whom the EU has now filed four cases with the WTO (see EUROPE 11264) to “respect its WTO commitments in full”. “Once conditions are met, we can start envisaging something more ambitious for our bilateral trade relationship” she stated. Following Tuesday meeting, the EU side was somewhat upbeat about positive developments in these issues. Russia gave positive signals and showed willing to find a solution to the cases brought by the EU at the WTO, a Community source told us. (Emmanuel Hagry)',\n",

       " \"Obama’s 2015 trade agenda focuses on middle class By Doug Palmer 3/4/15 3:46 PM EST POLITICO President Barack Obama’s annual trade agenda, released on Wednesday as labor groups and other critics of his trade policies held a rally on Capitol Hill, stresses the importance of trade agreements to middleclass jobs and promises stronger worker protections for an estimated 649 million workers covered by two proposed pacts with European and AsiaPacific countries. “President Obama’s trade policy seeks to promote growth, support more wellpaying jobs in the United States, and strengthen the middle class,” the opening line of the report reads. Fortysix pages later, after recapping progress on the proposed TransPacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreements and an array of other trade initiatives, the report concludes by strongly reiterating that point: “The Obama Administration’s trade policy is firmly anchored in Middle Class Economics.” The congressionally mandated report comes as the White House is striving to conclude the TPP agreement with Japan and 10 other countries in the AsiaPacific region and stepping up efforts to win approval of trade promotion authority, which would allow Obama to submit trade agreements to Congress for straight upordown votes, without amendments. Rather than lay out major new initiatives, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman’s office has used the report to lay out its best economic and national security arguments for trade agreements, including a heavy emphasis on their importance to America’s standing the world and the negative consequences of inaction on the pacts. It devotes a section to trade promotion authority, which some critics consider undemocratic and even unconstitutional, that traces the lineage of the legislation back to the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which authorized the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to negotiate tariff reductions. “Every American president has had trade negotiating authority since then, except Richard Nixon,” the report , a line that seems to have been included to counter consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, whose own literature describes Nixon as the mastermind behind TPA, also known as “fasttrack” trade legislation. “Since 1974, 16 of the most damaging U.S. trade pacts, including NAFTA and the WTO, were negotiated and passed using an extreme procedure called 'Fast Track,'” the group  on its website. “When Richard Nixon was president, he cooked up Fast Track to seize power from Congress.” While work on the 1974 Trade Act did begin before Nixon resigned in August of that , the legislation was signed into law by President Gerald Ford. Since then, it has been renewed a number of times under both Republican and Democratic administrations, most recently in 2002 under President George W. Bush. The report credits the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into force in 1994, and a string of agreements negotiated under President George W. Bush, with helping to boost exports and supporting wellpaying jobs connected to trade. “Over the past five , exports of U.S. goods to our free trade agreement partners increased over 64 percent, significantly outpacing the increase of around 45 percent to our nonFTA partners,” the report . “It’s in our interest to build on this progress, because the United States is already an open economy.” Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Commerce Department on Wednesday estimated a record 11.7 million U.S. jobs were supported by exports in 2014, or about 5,800 jobs for every $1 billion of exports. That’s down from more than 7,100 jobs for every $1 billion of exports in 2009 because of higher export prices and productivity gains, the department . Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, accused the administration of “recycling the usual platitudes and distorted data” to make its case. “The report tries to obscure that our trade deficit with Korea has risen 72 percent since passage of the administration’s one major trade deal [in 2011], the administration’s goal of doubling exports by 2014 fell short by 64 percent due to weak export growth, and we suffered a jobskilling $912 billion goods trade deficit last  thanks in large part to the past agreements on which this administration’s proposed deals are based,” Wallach . One criticism of trade agreements is that they depress wages by making it easier for companies to move jobs overseas. The report does not directly address that point, but argues that trade agreements boost the number of jobs connected to exports, “which pay up to 18 percent more than jobs not related to exports.” The Obama administration also is pushing for strong labor and environmental protections in both the AsiaPacific and European trade agreements that would be enforceable under the same mechanisms that apply to commercial provisions of the pacts, the report . “In TPP, we are negotiating to put in place the largest expansion of enforceable labor rights in history, renegotiating NAFTA and bringing hundreds of millions of additional people under enforceable International Labor Organization standards,” the report . Between TPP and the TTIP agreement, “an estimated 649,762,600 workers in the combined free trade areas could benefit from the strongest labor protections in any trade agreement in history,” the report .\",\n",
       " 'Advocates: Not so fast on aquaculture regs By Jenny Hopkinson | 10/29/13 5:03 AM EST POLITICO Farmraised fish is one of the few types of food not currently available at the grocery store with a USDA organic label on it, but the department shouldn’t be in too much of a rush to rectify that, a handful of organic and consumer advocacy groups warn. The National Organic Standards Board received more than 900 letters in relation to its request for comments regarding the use of certain synthetics by aquaculture operations hoping to secure future organic accreditation. In particular, the NOSB is looking for reaction to petitions submitted in relation to allowing the use of trace minerals and vitamins, chlorine to be used as a disinfectant and tocopherols to delay rancidity in fats. The comment period closed Oct. 1, though many of the comments were only made publicly available after the reopening of the government Oct. 17. The board was supposed to discuss the petitions at an Oct. 22 to 24 meeting, in Louisville, Ky., but the meeting was canceled because of the government shutdown and has yet to be rescheduled. However, the Center for Food Safety says it’s too early to provide meaningful comments on the materials anyway. “Evaluating substances within the context that they are used is key to the NOSB materials review process,” the advocacy group says in its letter. “Without final regulations to govern organic aquaculture, it is impossible to meaningfully assess the necessity or essentiality of” synthetic materials for use in the program. “If you don’t know which species of fish are being grown, where, or whether the system is open or closed, how can you possibly begin to determine their feed requirements?” NOSB, an advisory panel made up of 15 organic company representatives, scientists, advocates and others, is tasked with providing the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service’s National Organic Program with advice on setting standards for the products permitted to contain the USDA organic seal. After receiving and reviewing comments, the NOSB will then make recommendations to the NOP, which will in turn draft the proposed standards. As it is, organic standards do not exist for either wildcaught or farmraised fish. However, the NOP has been working to create standards for aquaculture since at least 2001 when it was recommended by an industry task force to help U.S. seafood producers compete with companies in other countries that certify their farmed fish as organic and those that use a different thirdparty accreditation. More than a dozen countries have standards for organic aquaculture, including Australia, Canada, Italy and Norway. In 2005, NOP and NOSB formed the Aquaculture Working Group — which comprises representatives from industry, academia and environmental groups — to offer guidance and recommendations on the formation of an organic aquaculture program. Progress seemed stalled for several , but in a May 16, 2012, memo, Miles McEvoy, deputy administrator of NOP, told the NOSB that his staff was working on a proposed rule for the certification of organic animal aquaculture products, with the intention of completing the rulemaking process over two . McEvoy asked NOSB to start reviewing several petitions for synthetic materials to be given exemptions in advance. An NOP spokesman says rulemaking efforts are ongoing, though there is no timeline for the release of a proposal. But CFS and other groups question whether aquaculture can be genuinely organic at all. While a farmer can control the inputs onto his land, ensuring that fertilizer and pest management and other products meet organic standards, that level of control isn’t really available in a natural body of water, Lisa Bunin, CFS’s organic policy coordinator, says. For example, pollutants move freely through water, making it almost impossible to ensure a fish raised organically is not exposed. Further, some fish, such as salmon, are migratory, and stopping that migration would be adverse to the spirit of organic, Bunin adds. “We are skeptical because we don’t know the system in which we are talking about allowing aquaculture to take place. Does there need to be a synthetic environment for where these fish are grown” in order to be able to fully control the environment and ensure the fish are fully organic, Bunin says. Requiring a synthetic environment for organic aquaculture production would be problematic, she adds. “You don’t try to change the system to fit the product. If the product doesn’t fit the system then it can’t be organic.” The Cornucopia Institute, Consumers Union, Beyond Pesticides and the National Organic Coalition also have called for NOSB to reject the synthetic material petitions due to the lack of standards. “We are especially concerned that the board is unable to adequately review these petitioned materials to OFPA criteria, since it is has not been determined which aquaculture systems will be allowed,” writes Consumers Union in an Oct. 1 letter. While a material may be appropriate for use in one type of organic aquaculture system, it may not be appropriate in all cases, the group writes. “It is also not possible for the board to determine the essentiality of a material until there are standards specifying which systems are allowed and which fish species will be raised under the organic standards. … Until the board and the public have a clear understanding which systems will be allowed in organic aquaculture, we believe it is not possible to make an informed decision.” Noticeably absent from the comments about the synthetic materials that should be permitted in organic aquaculture operations was a letter from the Organic Trade Association. Gwendolyn Wyard, OTA’s regulatory director for organic standards and food safety,  the issue was not raised by her group’s members. ”We do not have any aquaculture members, so it simply has not been an area of focus in the past few ,” she . “That being , we do support emerging sectors such as organic aquaculture and the development of standards that are consistent with the principles of OFPA.”',\n",
       " 'World Bank admits botched resettlement policy WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) The World Bank admitted on Wednesday that it had no idea how many people may have been forced off their land and lost their jobs due to its projects in developing countries, and whether these people were compensated fairly and on time. The admission comes as the global development lender seeks to ramp up investments in risky infrastructure projects that often lead to forced resettlement, including dams and highways, in an effort to eliminate extreme poverty. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim pledged that \"we must and will do better,\" on a call with reporters, and launched an action plan to address shortcomings. In a recent case, indigenous Anuak people in Ethiopia Gambella region  the World Bank contributed to the Ethiopian government \"villagization\" program that forced about 70,000 people off their land. The bank Inspection Panel found that the forced evictions and the use of intimidation were not linked to the bank project, but that the World Bank did not fully assess and mitigate the risks. Similar issues have arisen in many of the bank projects that involve resettlement, according to internal reviews released on Wednesday, which found the lender did a \"poor job\" monitoring and reporting on the status of affected people. \"The sizeable gaps in information point to significant potential failures in the bank system for dealing with resettlement,\" according to an internal review from last June. By the bank limited data, about half a million people have been affected by resettlement out of a sample of 218 active projects. The World Bank  it did not have a clear idea of how many of those did not receive compensation or new land. The reviews also found that many countries may not be able to resettle people according to the bank own standards or set up proper grievance mechanisms. The findings could be problematic as the World Bank is considering putting more governments in charge of policing its aid projects, a move that watchdog groups worry could undermine social and environmental safeguards the lender currently has in place.

       " \"Developing Nations Blast WTO Agriculture Subsidies Report By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 6, 2015 March 5 — A recent World Trade Organization paper incited a vigorous debate about how poor and rich nations stand to benefit from increased agricultural subsidies during this week Agriculture Committee meeting in Geneva. WTO members sparred over a recently circulated Cairns Group paper that examined the domestic support data from 2001 to 2013 for the top 10 global traders of agriculture products—namely, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia and the U.S. The data showed that the rates of domestic support accelerated faster in developing nations than in developed nations over the past 10 . Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines, Bolivia, India, China and Brazil called the paper “unbalanced” because it played down the differences in the scale of support, which remains much higher in developed countries, according to a WTO official at the briefing. The difference in perspective lies at the heart of the ongoing disagreements that have stymied efforts to modernize WTO agriculture rules in line with the goals of the Doha Development Agenda. Developing Member Rates In absolute terms, the total support of all 10 members increased between 2001 and 2012, the paper . Domestic support levels increased faster in the four developing countries—China, Brazil, India and Indonesia—where the starting base was much lower, it . When compared to the value of production, support in developed countries was stable while in developing countries the proportion increased, the paper . Developed countries' support was proportionately higher towards the end of the evaluation period—at 19.3 percent of the value of production, versus 12.4 percent for developing countries. The most distorting type of domestic support—also known as amber box or aggregate measurement of support (AMS)—declined significantly in most of the developed countries, the paper . In contrast, amber box support for developing countries like India and China increased steadily over the past decade, the paper . Developing countries kept their amber box support below the “de minimis” level of up to 10 percent of the value of production, and 8.5 percent for China. ‘Unbalanced’ Paper India and China  support in developed countries is for large scale commercial farming while in their countries it is for millions of poor farmers,  a WTO official at the agriculture committee meetings. India recalculated the data of the Cairns report to show that support figures per person produce a different picture, the WTO official . In developing countries the support amounted to hundreds of dollars per person per  and up to thousands or tens of thousands per person per  in the developed nations. Australia called India per capita figures interesting and  it was concerned about the impact of support in India, which recently overtook Australia as the seventh largest trader. Developed Perspective The U.S. presented some separate data graphs showing how tradedistorting subsidies increased among developing members versus developed members, according to a WTO official at the meetings. Brazil  the U.S. presentation failed to reflect the same scale in order to show the difference between amounts of support given by richer and poorer countries. The EU  the data reflect the reforms it has undertaken to move support out of the distorting amber box to the minimally distorting green box, the WTO official . Argentina  it believed the scale of green box subsidies in developed countries is so large that it is causing trade distortion. The EU and New Zealand noted that some notifications were not current and could harm transparency efforts. China had only reported its domestic support notifications up to 2008; Russia had not filed its domestic support notifications since 2009; and India and Australia had not filed notifications since 2010.\",\n",

The Palestinian Authority has submitted a request in October 2009 and again in April 2010 to obtain a WTO observer status, trying to help its weak economy, which was badly affected by the restrictions imposed by Israel after it occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in 1967. However, observers say membership of the WTO would be useless since most of the commercial crossings of Palestine are under full Israeli control.',\n",
       " 'WTO Dispute Panel to Issue COOL Appeal Decision by May 18 By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 6, 2015 March 5 — A World Trade Organization panel overseeing the review of U.S. Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) rules  it would issue its appeal report by May 18. According to a March 3 notice, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) appellate panel  its report would be delayed because of its current workload, the number and complexity of the issues raised in the appeal proceedings, and the demands that this places on the WTO secretariat translation services. The case centers on the legality of amended U.S. COOL regulations—which require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered. Mexico and Canada have repeatedly claimed that U.S. COOL rules harm their pork and beef industries by imposing undue burdens and costs exceeding $1 billion per . During a pair of lengthy appellate body hearings held last month, U.S. trade officials  the rules do not unfairly discriminate against or burden other export countries and serve a legitimate purpose by helping consumers understand where their meat comes from (32 WTO, 2/18/15). Retaliatory Tariffs Loom The U.S. has already lost one WTO appeal of its COOL rules and was forced to amend the regulations in 2013. Last , a WTO DSB panel determined the amended rules imposed a greater “detrimental impact” on competition for Mexican and Canadian livestock than the original rules. If the WTO again finds the U.S. rules to be in noncompliance with international standards it may permit Mexico and Canada to seek billions of dollars in retaliatory trade measures until the U.S. rules adhere to the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. When the U.S. notified the DSB on Nov. 28 that it would appeal the earlier panel decision, participants requested an extension of the DSB requirement to issue an appellate report within 90 days of the initial notification.',\n",
       " 'Envoy: South Africa Working To Resolve Poultry Fight Before AGOA Renewal Inside U.S. Trade 03/06/2015 South Africa newly appointed envoy on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) this week  his country is urgently working to settle a dispute over antidumping (AD) duties on U.S. poultry that the U.S. industry charges has cut off its access to that market before Congress considers the renewal of the preference program this spring. Faizel Ismail in a March 4 press conference also indicated that a South African ban on U.S. poultry imports following the discovery of highpathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in noncommercial and commercial flocks in the Western United States could be limited so that only U.S. poultry from certain regions of the United States would be banned. The U.S. poultry industry has been pushing for such a regionalization, which would ensure that exports from Georgia and Delaware could still enter South Africa, an industry source . \"We have not wanted to allow any impediment to be on the way of the extension of AGOA,\" he . For this reason, South Africa has made an \"enormous effort\" to reach out to the poultry industry of the United States. He  South Africa is working to meet the deadline of an AGOA bill release, which he  he understands is \"imminent.\" \"We are in the process of finding a way of reaching a compromise, so that U.S. poultry exporters could find some relief in the South African market and share the market with us, recognizing that we too have concerns we have industry, we have a lot of unemployment, we too want to retain a poultry industry in South Africa,\" he . Ismail, who was his country ambassador to the World Trade Organization until last , indicated that the fight over U.S. poultry exports should be the only issue that must be resolved to ensure that his country will retain its benefits when Congress attempts to renew AGOA this spring. Other U.S. complaints about how South African sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are impeding its exports of beef and pork should be dealt with as ongoing bilateral trade issues, he . Among those issues are South Africa interests are access for its avocados to the U.S. market, he  in advance of a March 5 meeting with USDA and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. South Africa is in the process of applying for the necessary certification from USDA to ship avocados, but has not met all of the requirements. He  that the process is complicated, which is why there is a need for \"political goodwill to unblock\" the bureaucratic process. An industry source  that USDA is currently in the beginning stages of evaluating the possibility of allowing avocado imports from South Africa following a request from the government in Pretoria, and speculated that a proposed rule might not come out for another . The March 5 meeting will likely be postponed by a day because the federal government is closed due to snow. Citrus is also on the agenda of that meeting, where the two sides will likely discuss South Africa interest in shipping more oranges to the United States. That effort has faced pushback from California citrus growers who charge this could import black spot disease, prevalent in South Africa, to the United States (Inside U.S. Trade, Nov. 14, 2014). Ismail  these SPS issues involve continuing efforts by both countries, and in the case of diseases like the avian flu, countries have to make decisions in accordance with their health requirements. He  that based on meetings earlier this week and the scheduled session with USTR and USDA, the South African delegation is \"quite hopeful that further progress will be made\" on poultry and other issues and there should not be impediments \"for the continuation of the process of extending AGOA.\" South Africa AD duties on U.S. poultry were the subject of a March 4 meeting between Ismail and the visiting South African delegation and Sens. Chris Coons (DDE) and Johnny Isakson (RGA), the cochairs of the Senate Chicken Caucus. Both senators have publicly and repeatedly threatened that they would work to cut off South Africa AGOA benefits if it fails to drop the AD duties. Ismail  the South African delegation was \"reasonably convinced\" it had made progress through the meetings and through the industryto industry dialogue. He also signaled that South Africa is urging U.S. officials to push their domestic industry groups to reach a compromise as hard as he believes South Africa is pushing their own domestic industry association. \"We have urged them to also contribute on their side to helping their industry to move closer to our industry,\" he . \"We on our side have continued to encourage our industry to participate in these discussions with a view to finally compromise, so we are pretty certain that we will find compromise pretty soon.\" Following the meeting, a spokesman for Coons  that the discussion was \"very pleasant, candid, and constructive,\" and signaled that Coons was pleased with the progress of the negotiations. \"Sen. Coons was encouraged by the South African government determination to reach an equitable agreement before Congress considers the reauthorization of AGOA this spring,\" the spokesman  about the meeting. \"Sen. Coons is hopeful that the combined pressure being applied by the U.S. Senate and other American officials, as well as that of the South African government, will result in the South African and American poultry industries reaching an agreement.\" Ismail  his main message on this trip, in addition to the discussions on poultry, is that AGOA should be extended for 15  or more. He  that this is also an opinion shared by the African Union officials with whom he met at the organization mission in Washington. A representative from the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) accompanying the delegation discussed the chicken fight this week with a representative from the National Chicken Council (NCC) in a meeting that government officials did not attend, a South African official told Inside U.S. Trade. Representatives from the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) were unable to attend the meeting in Washington for logistical reasons, a poultry industry source . However, SAPA CEO, Kevin Lovell, is scheduled to fly to Atlanta for a March 6 meeting with USAPEEC representatives at their headquarters. This source  the meeting with Lovell will be mostly informal and does not signal that the two sides are approaching a conclusion to the talks or any legal agreement. However, this source  that the two sides are \"on the same page discussing the pertinent issues.\" Ismail confirmed that the two countries\\' respective industries are negotiating a tariffrate quota through which U.S. producers would be able to ship their product to South Africa under a mostfavored nation duty, and would pay the AD duty after filling that tonnage (Inside U.S. Trade, Feb. 20). The envoy also  that Southern African countries that share a customs union with South Africa, such as Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia, are also interested in the poultry talks because of the \"spillover\" effect that could occur with any significant change to the market dynamic in the union. He  that the national poultry industry groups for these countries have consulted with SAPA on the talks, but did not elaborate what their positions are. On poultry, the main SPS issue relates to a blanket South African ban on U.S. poultry imports after HPAI outbreaks were detected in both commercial and noncommercial flocks in states including Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho. The U.S. industry and USDA take the position that this type of measure, which has also been instituted in South Korea and China, is unfair to poultry producers in regions of the United States like Delaware and Georgia that are not affected by the outbreaks and geographically distant from the affected states. Ismail signaled at the briefing that South Africa is considering regionalization, but noted that countries must do what they consider necessary to protect animal and plant health. Ismail highlighted that South Africa was hoping for \"further progress\" on poultry and other issues at those meetings, but  that a number of the discussions on other issues, like investment, will not happen in the context of AGOA renewal but instead simply as talks related to ongoing bilateral issues. In addition to the agricultural issues, Ismail  that areas such as investment and U.S. complaints about the differential in tariffs that South Africa applies to European Union exports under a preferential trade deal compared to U.S. exports are less pressing in the context of AGOA renewal. \"The only way in which we can reduce those tariffs, also for the United States, is if there is a fullyfledged, comprehensive trade agreement between the two countries, Ismail . He  this is a longterm prospect, but that South Africa is \"certainly willing to consider a dialogue on how we could address those concerns with the United States.\" The U.S. and South Africa, along with other members of the Southern African Customs Union broke off negotiations for an FTA in 2006 (Inside U.S. Trade, April 21, 2006).',\n",
       " 'Ecuador economy: Country faces balanceofpayments dilemma 5 March 2015 Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire Ecuador new foreigntrade minister, Diego Aulestia, announced in February that the government would soon introduce a new set of safeguard tariffs in an effort to protect dollarised Ecuador balanceofpayments position. The tariffsto be applied to imports at a rate of 20%will seek to compensate for the steep decline in global oil prices, which is weighing on oil export revenue, and the stronger US dollar, which is damaging the external competitiveness of the nonoil export sector. Critics question the potential effectiveness of the measure. The government hopes to introduce the new safeguards immediately. In early January the country imposed safeguard tariffsof 21% and 7% respectivelyon two of its Comunidad Andina (CAN, Andean Community) partners, Colombia and Peru, as remedial action against the depreciation of the Colombian peso and the Peruvian nuevo sol against the US dollar. These tariffs were due to be lifted on February 27th, but it now appears that they may remain until the substitute measures are in place. This could prompt additional complaints by Colombia and Peru before the CAN general secretariat, which has already ruled that the measures are illegal and must be lifted, with due compensation paid to Colombia and Peru. Familiar ground for local manufacturers Mr Aulestia has  that the new safeguards will be implemented for a one period, with a review every three months. According to the industry minister, Ramiro González, the 20% tariff will be levied on finished goods and luxury items. It will not be levied on imports of capital goods and raw materials required for domestic manufacturing, with the exception of capital and primary inputs already produced in the country. Mr González has been keen to emphasise that the local private sector was consulted in advance, and that the objective is to avoid pushing up local manufacturing costs, including for exportoriented producers already struggling with a stronger dollar. However, local companies are nervous; preexisting import restrictions implemented as part of the government importsubstitution policies have not had the desired effect. The president, Rafael Correa, insists that global safeguards are contemplated under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and as such will be WTOcompliant. However, as part of the approvals procedure, the IMF must first examine Ecuador balanceofpayments position for signs of stress, which it is obliged to do within three days of receiving Ecuador proposal. It will then report its findings back to the WTO, which will make a decision over whether to allow the measures to be implemented. Crunch time for the balance of payments Ecuador balanceofpayments position is heavily dependent on the trade account. Elsewhere in the current account, the country typically runs a deficit on the services and income side, while in the capital account, foreign direct investment inflows are insufficient to bridge the financing gap. As such, the balance of payments is vulnerable this , with oil export revenues expected to fall by some 50%. Although the overall trade balance posted only a marginal deficit last  (US$727m), owing to previously imposed import restrictions and subdued domestic demand, there was a nonoil trade deficit of US$7.6bn, up by 17.5%  on . Mr Correa has raised concerns about the risks emanating from a threat to the balance of payments, which by extension, could endanger Ecuador fifteenold use of the US dollar. In his weekly broadcast on February 2nd, he noted \"structural problems\" in the balance of payments, relating to the fact that the public sectorthrough its control of the dominant oil sectorbrings in the most foreign revenue, while the private sector typically posts a net foreigncurrency outflow (it posted a small overall net surplus of about US$1.8bn in 2014). Mr Correa noted that, with fewer oil export revenues feeding into the economy in 2015, domestic financial intermediation will fall, which could be strongly recessionary, as it would impact both private investment and consumption, putting the brakes on domestic economic activity (as well as reducing the government budgeted strong increase in the tax take this ). In a worstcase scenario, Ecuador could find itself lacking liquidity to pay for imports and, in parallel, suffer from a domestic liquidity crisis. Notably, total foreign reserves held at the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the Central Bank) amounted to US$3.8bn (equivalent to less than two months of import cover) as at February 20th. Thus, import restrictions, above all, aim to reduce cash outflows. However, critics of the government argue that the measures are distortive and may have the unintended effect of holding down domestic economic activity (Ecuador remains highly importdependent), laying bare the highspending government failure to put money by for a rainy day during the commodity price bonanza of the past decade. Still banking on China Following a trip to Beijing in early January, Mr Correa announced US$7.5bn in new lending from China, of which the government says US$4bn will become available this . However, the actual disbursement schedule has not been made public and much of the funding is likely to be tied to specific projects, and as such will not necessarily appear in BCE reserves. Although the government also says that it has access to US$800m in multilateral lending this , Ecuador may yet have to return to international capital markets for a second sovereign bond issue, notwithstanding the prospect of higher US interest rates.',\n",

The US carriers together with workers\\' groups issued a 55 page report detailing how \"unfair\" subsidies given to Gulf rivals Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have allowed them to wrest market share from the US industry. They called on the US government to raise the issue with the governments and urged changes to the bilateral commercial aviation agreements with them. \"The multibillion dollar subsidies... have allowed Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates to rapidly expand their fleets and international routes, distorting the commercial marketplace to the severe detriment of US employment, the US economy and the US airline industry,\" the US group .

The report  that, with the backing of state support, the Gulf airlines are targeting more international traffic to the United States on the back of the US \"Open Skies\" aviation agreements with Qatar and UAE. It noted their huge share of orders for widebody aircraft, representing about onequarter of the entire global fleet of widebody aircraft. \"Because the Gulf carriers are adding this new capacity at rates that substantially exceed global GDP growth which drives growth in demand for air transport services the only way to accomplish this feat is to continue taking passengers from other countries\\' carriers,\" they . They called on the US government to open new talks over the air agreements to address what they  are violations of those pacts, and pressed for changes. \"The Open Skies agreements conferred enormous benefits on Qatar and the UAE by opening the most lucrative market in the world to their airlines,\" the group accused.

       " 'US sugar industry attacks ‘misleading’ WHO guidelines Scheherazade Daneshkhu, Consumer Industries Editor Financial Times March 4, 2015 8:53 pm The US sugar industry has slammed “misleading” new recommendations from the World Health Organisation that people should halve their daily intake. The UNaffiliated body issued guidelines on Wednesday saying adults and children should limit the amount of sugar they consume to less than 10 per cent of their daily energy intake — which for an adult male would be the equivalent of less than two cans of CocaCola. Halving that to 5 per cent, equivalent to six teaspoons of sugar a day, would provide “additional health benefits,” according to Francesco Branca, director of the WHO’s nutrition department. “We have solid evidence that keeping intake of [added] sugars to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake reduces the risks of overweight, obesity and tooth decay,” he . The guidelines, which were little changed from WHO draft recommendations last  — were welcomed by health groups. Graham MacGregor, chairman of Action on Sugar, a UK lobby group, : “We have known about the health risks of sugar for  and yet no effective action has been taken. “The WHO has indicated that we should drastically lower our sugar intake — it is time for the UK government, and governments around the world, to take action.” But the Sugar Association, the US industry group, : “This guideline misleads consumers by its use of poorquality, weak and inconsistent data to link a level of sugars intake with reduced disease risk.” The food and drink industry is at the sharp end of an increasingly charged debate about the role of sugar and fat in causing health problems — especially among children who tend to eat more sugar as a proportion of their diet than adults. Manufacturers are under pressure from consumer groups and governments to reduce sugar and fat in processed foods because of rising obesity rates and increases in type two diabetes and some cancers. Governments are considering measures, including taxes on sugary fizzy drinks. Mexico has introduced such a taxin an effort to curb consumption in the face of growing health costs. The WHO : “There is increasing concern that intake of free sugars [sugar added to food], particularly in the form of sugarsweetened beverages, increases overall energy intake and may reduce the intake of foods containing more nutritionally adequate calories, leading to an unhealthy diet and weight gain.” But the food and drink industry insists that obesity is a lifestyle problem based on eating too much and exercising too little. Barbara Gallani, a director at the UK’s Food and Drink Federation, a lobby group, criticised “hysterical food and nutrition messages we are increasingly seeing peddled by a range of stakeholders often focus on individual nutrients and [are] rarely backed by robust or uptodate science”. The recommendations come after the US dietary guidelines advisory committee, urged Washington to consider taxing carbonated drinks “to confront the nation’s obesity epidemic and its devastating metabolic consequences”. The WHO  the 10 per cent limit was “a strong recommendation” based on scientific evidence while the 5 per cent level was “conditional”, indicating a weaker scientific link. In Europe as a whole, adults take 78 per cent of their daily intake as free sugar but that rises to 1617 per cent in Spain and the UK. Nita Forouhi, a public health physician at the University of Cambridge,  the WHO had sent “a clear message that less is better” when it comes to sugar intake.',\n",

Korea, Japan: minister 7 mars 2015 Yonhap English News BEIJING, March 7 (Yonhap) Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng  Saturday that Beijing will \"accelerate\" negotiations this  with South Korea and Japan aimed at forging a threeway free trade agreement. Speaking at an annual press conference, Gao also reiterated that South Korea and China will spare no effort to formally sign a bilateral free trade agreement with South Korea. \"Based on the conclusion and signing of the ChinaKorea FTA this , we will also move forward and accelerate ChinaJapanKorea FTA negotiations,\" Gao . After effectively concluding free trade negotiations last November, South Korea and China completed the \"initialing\" of the deal last month, marking one step closer to the official signing. Both sides voiced their hope to sign the deal within the first half of this . Gao described the free trade deal with South Korea as a \"highstandard,\" saying it will significantly boost bilateral trade between the two nations. In late 2012, South Korea, China and Japan launched threeway free trade talks aimed at slashing tariffs and other barriers among the three leading economies in Asia, but the negotiations have reported little progress. If successful, a deal would create one of the world biggest economic blocs with a combined gross domestic product of US$15 trillion. Diplomatic tension between China and Japan run deep because of competing claims over islands in the East China Sea. Relations between Seoul and Tokyo also remain frayed over Japan unrepentant attitude over its wartime atrocities, including the sexual enslavement of women by the Japanese military during World War II. Besides the threeway free trade talks with South Korea and Japan, China is promoting a broader regional trade bloc in Asia, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The socalled RCEP talks involve the 10 member ASEAN countries plus six others South Korea, China, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand. Gao  China hopes to wrap up negotiations for an \"updated version of the free trade area between China and ASEAN countries, as well as talks for the RCEP by the end of 2015.\" Beset by weak global demand, China has lowered its growth target in trade to \"around 6 percent\" this .

Mr Monjur Ahmed, an adviser to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI),  that the local producers and manufacturers had almost no knowledge about the trade remedial measures. \"Businesspeople have no clear idea about safeguard or antidumping duties,\" he told the FE. \"The procedures are also very technical and complex. Moreover, all these involve a timeconsuming process.\" Take the case of a leading toiletry company of Bangladesh. Once, the company urged the BTC to impose antidumping duty on a certain product on the plea that the product was being imported at a lower price than the domestic price. The tariff commission, however, found that the problem was related to a raw material used for a certain finished toiletry product and nothing like dumping. In fact, the antidumping duty can be imposed only on proper investigation and on finding a causal linkage of dumping with the damage to local manufacturers. To be precise, dumping means selling a product to one country at a price less than that prevailing in the country of origin. Mr Ahmed also pointed out that there was no legal protection to keep the information, furnished by the producers for investigation, secret. \"If tax authority or any other government agency has got the information from the tariff commission, they may harass the firm or industry concerned,\" he added. \"A legal provision must be there to keep any information, acquired for investigation, secret and nontransferable to any other authority.\" In this regard, BTC chairman Dr Rahman told the FE that they were working on revising the tariff commission act and such a legal provision would be included there. As it takes six to nine months for investigating damage caused by abnormal import hike, dumping or subsidised import, local firms and companies find it easier to lobby with the NBR for imposing or increasing regulatory and supplementary duties on the products. \"But, neither supplementary nor regulatory duty can be a longterm protection for local industries,\"  Mr Ahmed. \"On the other hand, no trade remedial measure will be effective as long as mispricing and fraudulence in imports are there.\" According to WTO statistics, some 2,966 antidumping measures have taken by 98 member countries as of June 30, 2014 China, Japan, South Korea, USA, Indonesia and India are the major countries take these measures.',\n",

The \"new normal,\" a phrase to describe China current economic situation, \"includes the successful rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards a consumer and service economy,\" noted Hendrischke, a fluent Mandarin speaker who once worked in China as a diplomat for many . With consumption now contributing 51 percent to economic growth and the valueadded of the service sector accounting for 48 percent of GDP, \"these measures are several percentage points above the original targets for 2015,\" he continued. These achievements, together with those in poverty reduction and social inclusion, \"show that the government has been able to overfulfill on its commitments,\"  the professor. The \"new normal,\" he added, also includes an acute sense of the risks of the middle income trap facing China industrial structure, as \"Li Keqiang acknowledged that the traditional lowcost manufacturing basis of the Chinese economy is no longer sustainable. \"The new normal is a stronger service orientation and highend manufacturing in areas where China will have to create its own markets by extending its domestic economies of scale, for example in infrastructure and transport, into global markets.\" Operating in these markets requires institutional reforms, which Hendrischke referred to as another element of the new normal. Reforms on public finances and the stateowned sector \"have now moved onto the government agenda as successful experiments, preparing the ground for their wider adoption during the 13th FiveYear Plan,\" which will be rolled out in early 2016, noted the observer. Internationally, the \"new normal\" is more complex than the \"old normal\" of business, Hendrischke , adding that \"the world economy is undergoing profound adjustment, its recovery lacks drive, (and) the influence of geopolitics is increasing.\" The Chinese premier is anticipating growing economic difficulties, and his response is a more proactive foreign economic policy that integrates foreign trade and investment into China regional and global strategies, he . \"The overall strategy is to make China an international trade and manufacturing hub with its own value chains extending globally, parallel to the North American and European hubs.\" Hendrischke noticed that Australia was mentioned twice in Li report, once in relation to the development of free trade zones and once in regard to the free trade agreement between the two countries. \"This shows that Australia is an  player in China regional strategy,\" he . \"Australia stands to benefit from the new normal as a contributor to Chinese value chains, in particular those in services, including education, agribusiness, highend manufacturing and other focal areas in current policies and the next five plan.\"',\n",

In trade negotiations, even one own country is troublesome, as the catfish conundrum illustrates. And the degree of difficulty in achieving a freetrade pact is proportional to the number of Democrats in Congress. As U.S. trade representative, Froman goal is completion and ratification of the TransPacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 AsiaPacific nations, from Chile to South Korea, that generate 37 percent of the world economic product. The TPP aims not just to liberalize trade but also to reform some of these nations\\' domestic policies, particularly concerning labor and environmental issues, partly to entice certain Democratic constituencies to soften their opposition to free trade. Some developing nations, such as Vietnam, welcome some compulsory rationality eing required by trading rules to limit subsidies to sclerotic stateowned enterprises. But beware of ostensibly altruistic protectionism rotectionism with moral pretensions. Sometimes poorer nations want higher standards forced on them. Other times rich nations use higher standards to raise production costs in, and thereby lower the competitiveness of, poorer countries. Negotiation and ratification of the TPP will be easier if Congress gives Obama what prior presidents have received fasttrack\" authority guaranteeing an upordown vote on the agreement without amendments. But Obama aggressive aggrandizement of executive power through unilateral actions (regarding the Affordable Care Act, immigration, etc.) has been unprecedented in its sweep and undisguised in its disdain for Congress. This has produced the muchpraised but elusive joy of bipartisanship: Conservative Republicans, eager to express separationofpowers rectitude, are joining liberal Democrats, eager to derail any agreement, in opposing fast track. Immersed in this political equivalent of threedimensional chess, the administration is serenely confident that enough Democratic votes will join with large majorities of Republicans to ratify what is negotiated, even without fast track. Even if Republicans representing Southern catfish farmers must be mollified by restricting imports of Asian catfish that are processed in American plants in blue states. The two largest achievements during Bill Clinton presidency occurred in spite of Democrats. Welfare reform was forced upon him by a Republicancontrolled Congress (he vetoed it twice before relenting), and the North American Free Trade Agreement was ratified in spite of congressional Democrats (a majority of whom voted against it). Now, the TPP otentially the best result of the Obama  epends on Republicans. Democrats are plucking up the protectionist banner unfurled by 19thcentury Republicans, who were tireless defenders of the strong (manufacturers) against consumers.HYPERLINK \"calendar:T5:Today\" Today, many Democrats agree with Rep. Rosa DeLauro (DConn.), who says that the United States \"has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.\" Notice the slippery language (\"since NAFTA\"), and remember the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy: The rooster crows and then the sun rises, therefore the crowing caused the sunrise. Manufacturing jobs have been declining as a share of total employment since 1950 and in actual number since 1979. But because of productivity improvements, manufacturing production and exports are near alltime highs. Granted, Froman says, some imports substitute for domestic products. But many imports are \"intermediate goods\" that go into the production of domestic goods, some of which are exported. And, he says, 50 percent of imports from Canada and Mexico, our first and thirdlargest trading partners, are used as inputs in the manufacturing of American products. Furthermore, Froman says, free trade is progressive in the sense that lowerincome Americans spend a larger portion of their disposable income than more affluent Americans spend on such imports such as food and clothing. You who are reading this column probably have a chronic, indeed incurable trade deficit with your barber or hair dresser. You regularly buy what he or she sells, yet he or she never buys anything from you. But things somehow work out. As they do between nations, because as the late Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page, once wrote, \"International transactions are always in balance, by definition.\" \"Protectionism,\"  Clinton during the NAFTA debate, \"is just a fancy word for giving up; we want to compete and win.\" But now, even more than then, Democrats are the party of a United States in a defensive crouch, flinching from globalization challenges.

       " 'Here comes China 2.0 7 mars 2015 The Australian Financial Review Economy Beijing is putting its industrialdriven past behind it, creating victims and victors along the way, write Angus Grigg and Lisa Murray. A Maserati Quattroporte drove into Jianxi Province last summer just as China credit crunch started to bite. Its destination was the central city of Xiyu, where a loan shark waited. The driver, like many of his contemporaries running trading companies, was in a tight spot. He needed cash, and quickly. Such haste meant the deepblue, fourdoor sedan with its black grill and silver trident was exchanged for 800,000 yuan ($166,000), or half its purchase price just three months earlier. The terms were simple. The driver had four months to repay the loan at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or forfeit the Italian sports car. For the driver, it was a bet on the Chinese economy a highstakes wager the country would return to its supercharged growth of the past two decades as it had so many times before. The optimistic assumption was based on a belief the government would provide more credit to banks and those trading steel, cement and other finished goods would be flush once again. The economy would be reinflated and the game would begin anew. But that bounceback never did come and the driver lost his prized Maserati, allowing the loan shark, who asked not to be named, to turn an easy profit of 400,000 yuan, he told AFR Weekend. \"Business is pretty good,\" he says. That anyone, even the most leveraged trader could fall over in an economy that grew at 7.4 per cent last  would seem perverse. But it not the actual number that is . It about where it has come from. In China case, that number was 10.4 per cent just four  ago and on Thursday, China Premier Li Keqiang,  it would be about 7 per cent this  the slowest growth rate in 24  and the country so called \"new normal\". The question, therefore, must be: what does 7 per cent growth look like for the world second biggest economy and its major trading partners? In coal towns and steel cities across central and northern China the outlook is grim. \"My main clients are in the steel, mining and the property sector these days,\" says the loan shark, who notes there has been a spike in the number of clients forfeiting their property recently after failing to repay loans. They are victims of what is being labelled \"peak China\" or perhaps a better description is \"old China\". That was a China reliant on the construction of apartments, roads and rail lines for its growth a growth that required ever greater amounts of the coking coal and iron ore. But surging corporate and government debt, chronic overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and an estimated 40 million empty apartments forced policymakers to change gears. They are reducing China reliance on investmentled growth, while attempting to shut down inefficient steel mills and highpolluting factories. As a result of this new found discipline and a push towards a greener China, iron ore and coking coal prices have halved over the past . No one is brave enough to forecast a rebound and after the Chinese Premier delivered his annual speech to Parliament, iron ore futures dropped 3 per cent to below $US60 a tonne on the weak outlook for growth. But this is the \"old China\" a China the government is looking to put behind it. In the wealthier coastal provinces and some parts of the country fastgrowing west, China 2.0 is emerging. Here the people are richer than ever. Like Australia three  ago, China is now experiencing a twospeed economy. While steel demand barely grew last , consumerled real consumption grew at 10.9 per cent. \"China is still the world best consumption story,\" says Andy Rothman, a longtime China bull and economist with fund manager Matthews Asia. A look at the raw numbers shows the wealth effect from two decades of rapid growth. Over the past decade, real urban and rural incomes have more than doubled. That in turn has created big opportunities for countries like Australia to sell beef, milk and holidays to China growing number of middleclass consumers. While China growth rate is most certainly slowing, it is still becoming a much bigger economy with a bigger footprint in the global market. According to Danny Quah, a professor at the London School of Economics, a growth rate of 7 per cent this  will result in additional economic output 2.6 times greater than that produced by 12 per cent growth 10  ago. In dollar terms, Quah says, 7 per cent growth should see China add $US790 billion in output over the next 12 months, in nominal terms at market exchange rates. That compares with $US274 billion of extra output produced by 12 per cent growth in 2005. To put these figures into context, China additional output this  is bigger than the entire Turkish economy. \"If China growth slows from having switched to greater reliance on domestic consumption, then export opportunities for the rest of the world will be correspondingly larger,\" Quah wrote in a paper published by the Brookings Institute. That , challenges do exist to China consumer story. As Premier Li noted in his speech, \"the number of new areas of strong consumer activity is limited\". This appears to be a reference to the bottom 40 per cent of Chinese households accounting for just 17.5 per cent of spending, a figure that has barely changed over the past 14 . The rosy outlook for Chinese consumption is also contingent on the country continuing to muddle through, without a systemic crisis brought on by the twin evils of a credit bubble and oversupply in the housing market. Muddling through is no sure thing, especially after a senior government official likened the current economic conditions in China to the months before the 1998 Asian financial crisis. The counterpoint to this argument is the government $US3.8 trillion ($4.8 trillion) in foreign currency reserves, which are more than adequate to ward off a sharp devaluation of the yuan as capital leaves the country. Barring a major external shock, this should ensure the government rhetoric around the economy being \"stable\" remains the case. That means the likes of Shanghai tennis coach Henry Chen will continue to consume, take overseas holidays and enjoy a life that only one generation ago was beyond comprehension. Driving through the city old French Concession, in his new Hyundai Sonata, the 34old is hardly troubled by China slowing economy. His gold iPhone 6 is on the charger and there an IKEA catalogue on the dashboard. He talking about his trip to Australia during last month Chinese New Year holiday. Chen, his wife and fiveold daughter spent $15,000 travelling to Cairns, the Gold Coast and Sydney. They ate out every night, took a helicopter ride over Fitzroy Island, stayed in fivestar hotels and couldn\\'t believe how cheap a steak was an observation few Australians would make. \"We\\'ve now been to Japan, Korea, Singapore and Thailand,\" he says. Chen parents, however, have never been outside greater China. \"My wife love bags,\" he says between tennis lessons. \"She buys too many bags. Coach, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Prada.\" Not that she added to her collection in Australia, as all their excess baggage was taken up with 20 kilograms of milk powder for their daughter. By Chinese standards, the Chens, with an annual family income of about $100,000, are beyond middle class. While Chen sharpens the ground strokes of wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs and expatriates on the tennis court, his wife manages a clothing factory for a Spanish fashion label. As a result, they earn more than a group McKinsey and Company defines as upper middle class. In 2012, this group earning between $22,000 and $48,000 a , numbered just 14 per cent of urban households. But the consulting firm estimates the segment will grow to 54 per cent of urban households by 2020. That around 350 million people, more than the entire population of the United States. These are the people that buy imported food, might join a gym and can afford the occasional overseas holiday. It is this group Australians are increasingly seeing at major sights around the country. According to federal government figures, 124,000 tourist visas for Chinese nationals were processed in the six weeks leading up to the Lunar New Year holiday, a 23 per cent increase from the previous . For Australia, this meant full hotels and crowded restaurants, but this group coming to Australia made up just 2.4 per cent of an estimated 5 million Chinese people who travelled overseas during the holiday. The problem for Australia is the lift this gives to tourism and other sectors such as education and food will never make up for the economic dent of falling coal and iron ore prices. The trade statistics make this point. In the  to HYPERLINK \"calendar:T2:June 30, 2014\" June 30, 2014 iron ore was Australia top export, valued at $57 billion followed by coal at $9.3 billion. Educationrelated travel ranked fourth at $4.1 billion, followed by personal travel at $1.9 billion. Agriculture was worth $8.7 billion. The issue is that Australia can\\'t feed, educate and provide holidays to China in the same way as the country delivered raw materials to build its infrastructure, due to capacity constraints. There simply not enough hotel rooms, agricultural land or university places. It means as China moves beyond its infrastructure building phase to an economy more reliant on consumption, Australia is not well equipped make the same shift. The government own fact sheet on last  China freetrade agreement unintentionally made this point. It killed off the idea of Australian being the \"food bowl of Asia\" saying the \"delicatessen of Asia\" was a better label. Australia place was to provide \"niche sales in premium markets\", the government . While this is a more realistic approach, niche markets will not balance the federal budget or raise overall living standards. Australia, for all its prosperity over the past decade, was tapped into the old Chinese economy. And few Australians may realise just how much this old China is hurting, as the days of growth at any cost to the environment and the longterm health of the banking system quickly fade. It far broader than simply a trader who lost his Maserati. For the province of Inner Mongolia, coal production declined by 41 per cent in January compared with a  earlier, according to the local government. Overall, China coal production and consumption fell for the first time in 14  in 2014, due to the slowing economy and a switch to cleaner fuel sources. \"The question is not whether peak coal is going to happen,\" says Li Shuo, a senior climate analyst with Greenpeace East Asia. \"It whether peak coal has already happened. The Premier hinted at this in his speech, saying China would \"strive for zerogrowth in the consumption of coal in key areas of the country\" this . In iron ore, the chief information officer at MySteel, Xu Xiangchun,  the lower growth target would see China iron ore consumption decline between 2 per cent and 3 per cent this . This compares with a rise of 1 per cent last . Australia lowcost producers will be largely immune from this fall in overall demand, as they grab market share from highcost Chinese miners. But they will still feel the pain of lower prices, with the World Bank saying during the week the current supply glut was likely to last for the next two . It leads to an acute, if painful observation, from one Australian who has been a longtime observer of China. \"Australia is more leveraged to the old China than most Chinese people,\" he says. Henry Chen, hitting tennis balls and joking about his wife obsession with handbags, certainly gives this impression.',\n",

       " \"U.S., China Row Over Changes to WTO Agricultural Subsidy Rules By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 9, 2015 March 6 — Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke and Chinese Ambassador Yu Jianhua had a sharp exchange over the issue of domestic support for agriculture during a March 6 meeting in Geneva. Yu rebuffed Punke question as to how emerging economies could adjust their levels of tradedistorting domestic support in addition to the provisions of the 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4), according to officials who attended the meeting. The discussion then devolved into finger pointing about the impact of the U.S. and China respective agricultural subsidies on global markets. The meeting of the World Trade Organization Agriculture Committee in Special Session ended without a clear resolution to the debate. If the policy division between the U.S. and China continues unabated, it could threaten the WTO aspirations of wrapping up the 2001 Doha Round. Difficult Conversation Friday debate focused on a section of the Rev. 4 text that provides flexibilities to recently acceded members—such as China—with regard to their obligations to reduce overall tradedistorting domestic support policies. The U.S. suggested that recently acceded members could forego an exemption of their de minimis entitlements under paragraph 12 of the Rev. 4 text. Yu  that China “would make no contribution toward new disciplines on domestic support,”  one official who was present at the meeting. The U.S. then pointed to new research “highlighting the tens of billions spent by China and India on domestic support programs, and pointed to the impact of those subsidies on poor farmers in other developing countries,” the official told Bloomberg BNA Yu  that on a per capita basis, Chinese farmers receive a much smaller fraction of agricultural subsidies when compared to the subsidies the U.S. provides to its farmers. “The debate became particularly heated when Punke referenced figures from the independent International Cotton Advisory Committee showing that China cotton subsidies are ten times higher than any other cotton subsidizer in the world,” the official . Creative Ideas The U.S. approach is to place the onus on emerging economies to explain their positions without offering any concessions in return, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA in separate interviews. Indeed, the U.S. has not yet signaled to WTO members how it would modify its current agricultural policies to advance the goals of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Some Geneva trade officials  that the U.S. is reluctant to volunteer any concessions until Congress passes legislation to grant trade promotion authority to the president. “We are at the table, ready to explore whether there are creative ideas to address disciplines on trade distorting subsidies that cover all major subsidizers, including emerging economies,” a U.S. trade official told Bloomberg BNA via email. The Chinese mission did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 2015 Timeline The work of the agricultural negotiating committee is considered a crucial component of the WTO effort to advance a detailed work program by July 31, with the goal of concluding the Doha round. Geneva trade officials  that any ambition in the nonagricultural market access and services negotiations would be linked to the achievements, or lack thereof, in the agricultural negotiations committee. Though the discussions between China and the U.S. exhibit an increased level of engagement on particularly thorny elements of the DDA, some members are beginning to question the viability of the July 31 goal. It is more likely, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA, that the WTO work program negotiations will extend to the Dec. 15–18 Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. This week, European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem  that the goal of the WTO December ministerial meeting is to reach a political agreement on the Doha round. “I think it is possible. I'm not saying that it will be easy. But it a little bit now or never,” Malmstroem  at a March 5 speech in Brussels. “If we manage to conclude the Doha round, with of course the emphasis for the developing world, we can regain a little bit the credibility of [the] WTO, and we can start thinking about the postDoha agenda”\",\n",

The DSB will consider a European Union request to examine Russian duties on imports of paper, palm oil and refrigerators. Last month the EU  that Russia duties were higher than the levels Russia had agreed to when it joined the WTO in 2012 (39 WTO, 2/27/15). The DSB will consider a Korean request to study U.S. tariffs on steel products used for oil drilling called oil country tubular goods (OCTG). The U.S. Commerce Department imposed dumping margins of nearly 16 percent on Korean OCTG in violation of the WTO 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and AntiDumping Agreement, according to the Korean complaint (37 WTO, 2/25/15). The DSB will consider Canada request for a panel investigation of China antidumping duties on imports of Canadian cellulose pulp. The body will also look at Taiwan request for an investigation into Canada antidumping measures related to imports of certain carbon steel welded pipe originating from Taiwan. Market Access, Trade Review On March 9 WTO members will convene for an informal meeting of the Market Access Committee. The committee, which monitors tariff commitments among WTO members, last met in May 2014. On March 9–10 the WTO will hold its biennial trade policy review of Japan. The WTO found that Japan average tariffs on imports increased by 0.5 percent during the country last trade policy review in 2013 (34 WTO, 2/20/13). The WTO also noted that the Japanese government provided “substantial” support to its protected farm sector between 2011 and 2013. Azevedo in Berlin WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo will attend a March 11 meeting of international organizations hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. On March 13 the WTO Working Group on Trade and Transfer of Technology will meet in Geneva. The panel role is to examine the trade and transfer of technology between developed and developing members. WTO members will consider the status of negotiations aimed at eliminating tariffs and trade barriers on environmental goods and services at a March 13 meeting of the Committee on Trade and Environment in Special Session. Tobacco Plain Packaging Australia is expected to provide its first written submissions in the WTO dispute over its rules regarding plain packaging of tobacco products. Five WTO members—the Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Honduras, Indonesia and Cuba—are challenging Australia 2011 Tobacco Plain Packaging Act, which mandates colors and text for tobacco packaging. The countries argue that such laws impose unfair restrictions on the use of trademarks, geographical indications and other markings in violation of the TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body is not expected to issue its final decision on the complaint against Australia tobacco labeling rules until the first half of 2016.',\n",
       " 'Compulsory licensing soon for export of generic drugs by India NAYANIMA BASU New Delhi 9 March 2015 Business Standard The India pharmaceutical industry is expected to receive a massive boost if a recent attempt by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to amend its TRIPS (TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement on the access to essential medicines goes through. If it happens, it will enable India to export generic versions of some costly lifesaving drugs made under compulsory licensing to third world countries, especially in Africa, which do not have the production capacity for such medicines. In a meeting of the General Council on February 20 at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo  for the ratification to go through, it still requires 27 membercountries to approve. If so, the amendment can come into force by December, a top official told Business Standard. “It is an effective means of keeping prices of such drugs down because patent holders loathe seeing production licensed to other companies. India has ratified it. In fact, because of its production capacity, India has been seen as one of the countries that might be a thirdcountry producer,” the official added. The 2001 Doha Ministerial Conference had decided to amend the TRIPS Agreement by allowing generic copies made under compulsory licences to be exported to countries lacking production capacity, if certain conditions and procedures are followed. Generally, a country issues a compulsory license to produce generic versions of a patented drug for domestic consumption. However, in 2003 it was agreed that such a provision could be expanded for export purposes, for the benefit of least developed countries and those lacking manufacturing capacity. This was agreed in 2003 and implemented in 2005 but the ratification process could never be completed. What it says is the countries that lack the capacity to produce generic, lifesaving drugs can import these from third countries under compulsory licensing provisions in the TRIPS agreement. Presently, countries that require generics produced under compulsory licensing to be imported have used the waiver mechanism under the TRIPS pact. However, this isn’t enough. Countries with the wherewithal to export have to also change their domestic laws. So far, this has been only done by India, Norway, Canada and the European Union.',\n",

       " 'Canada Assesses Provisional Duties on Solar Panel Imports from China By Peter Menyasz WTO Reporter, March 9, 2015 March 6 — The Canada Border Services Agency has assessed provisional duties of up to 286.1 percent against solar energy equipment from China on the basis of a preliminary determination that the goods are being exported to Canada at dumped and subsidized prices. Imposition of the duties was accompanied by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal launch of its injury inquiry on the Chinese exports, as well as publication of the tribunal reasons for a preliminary finding that the dumped and subsidized Chinese goods were causing harm to domestic producers. The tribunal found increased imports in part related to the impact of a World Trade Organization ruling against an Ontario program to support the renewable energy sector (112 WTO, 6/11/14). The provisional duties apply to certain photovoltaic modules and laminates originating or exported from China that are usually classified under Harmonized System number 8541.40.00.22, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)  March 5 in a statement. A statement of reasons outlining the basis for its preliminary determination of dumping and subsidy is to be issued by March 20, 2015. Duties applied to nine exporters who responded to questionnaires issued by the CBSA ranged from 9.14 percent to 202.5 percent, while duties applied to all other Chinese exporters were set at 286.1 percent, based on an estimated margin of dumping of 202.0 percent and an estimated subsidy amount of 84.1 percent. The duties were levied under Section 38(1) of Canada Special Import Measures Act. Evidence filed with the CBSA estimated that the share of Canadian imports held by Chinese manufacturers jumped to 85.1 percent between October 2013 and September 2014 from 55.5 percent in 2012, and the agency indicated that its internal data confirmed those estimates. Provisional duties applied to specific Chinese exporters are (estimated margin of dumping and subsidy amount, respectively, in brackets): Wuxi Suntech Power Co Ltd., 202.5 percent (202, 0.5); Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Changshu) Inc., 174.2 percent (90.1, 84.1); Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. Ltd., 126.5 percent (125.7, 0.8); Zhejang Jinko Solar Co. Ltd., 115.9 percent (114.2, 1.7); Jinko Solar Co. Ltd., 111.8 percent (110.7, 1.1); Hanwha SolarOne (Qidong) Co. Ltd., 103.3 percent (103, 0.3); Hefei JA Solar Technology Co. Ltd., 50.6 percent (47.5, 3.1); Wuxi Taichen Machinery & Equipment Co. Ltd., 27.7 percent (25.9, 1.8); Renesola Jiangsu Ltd., 9.14 percent (9.1, 0.04). The duties apply to photovoltaic modules and laminates consisting of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, including laminates shipped or packaged with other components of photovoltaic modules and thinkfilm photovoltaic products produced from amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride or copper indium gallium selenide. Exempted are modules, laminates or thinfilm products with a power output of less than 100 watts, as well as those incorporated into electrical goods not used for power generation or that consume the electricity generated by the photovoltaic product. The CBSA launched in December 2014 an investigation into imports of the Chinese products, based on a complaint filed by four Ontario manufacturers—Torontobased Eclipsall Energy Corp., Sault St. Mariebased Heliene Inc., Mississaugabased Silfab Ontario Ltd. and Woodbridgebased Solgate Inc. Tribunal Launches Injury Inquiry The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT), meanwhile, launched March 5 its formal injury inquiry into whether the dumping or subsidization of the Chinese solar panels was causing injury or threatening to injure Canadian production of like products. The inquiry will include a public hearing to be held in Ottawa starting June 1, with a final determination to be issued by July 3. The CITT also issued March 5 a statement of reasons for its Feb. 3 preliminary finding of injury against the dumped or subsidized Chinese products, which concluded that there was a “reasonable indication” that the Chinese goods were harming or threatening to harm domestic production . Evidence submitted by the Canadian producers who filed the complaint indicated that, until recently, the domestic solar panel industry was shielded from the full impact of the dumped and subsidized goods by a domestic content requirement imposed by the Ontario government under its FeedIn Tariff (FIT) Program, the statement of reasons . The FIT Program provided renewable energy producers with a guaranteed, preferential rate on electricity produced using domestically made equipment, it . However, the program domestic content requirements were relaxed in response to a ruling by the World Trade Organization Appellate Body that concluded that violated WTO rules, it . “The circumstances in a key part of the domestic market have changed significantly to allow suppliers of foreign goods, including the subject goods, to compete directly with like goods,” it . “The Tribunal does not consider that the elimination of the domestic content requirement, in and of itself, is threatening to cause injury to the domestic industry. Rather, the threat of injury to the domestic industry arises from the presence of the dumped and subsidized goods in the new market environment.” The Chinese exports, which now compete directly with Canadianmade products, are entering the market in prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic production and are likely to increase demand for further imports, it . The volume of imports from China increased by 26 percent during the first half of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and accounted for an increasingly dominant share of the import market, it . In addition, Chinese producers of solar modules have significant excess capacity and significant inventories, with additional capacity expected to come online soon as two major Chinese manufacturers are expanding their facilities, it . The CITT also noted the imposition of antidumping and/or countervailing duties imposed in other jurisdictions, including the U.S., European Union and India. “It seems plausible, in the circumstances, that increasing volumes of the subject goods will find their way to Canada,” it .',\n",

Exports leapt 48.3 percent on to $169.2 billion while imports fell 20.5 percent to $108.6 billion, Customs  on its website. The country trade surplus, long a source of tensions with its trading partners, rose above a previous alltime monthly high of $60.0 billion recorded in January. The growth in exports last month was well ahead of the median estimate for a 14 percent jump in a Bloomberg survey of economists. But analysts were pessimistic about the outlook for exports and blamed the weak imports reading on falling commodity prices, with stringent bank financing for traders also a factor. China is a key driver of global growth but its economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, its weakest for almost a quarter of a century, and recent indicators show signs the slowdown is continuing. Customs attributed the surge in exports to a rise in outbound shipments ahead of the Lunar New Year, which fell on February 19 this . \"Affected by the Spring Festival factors, export companies in the country again rushed to export ahead of the holiday and only resumed working after it,\" the statement . The Lunar New Year fell on January 31 in 2014, followed by a weeklong national holiday, leading to a low comparison base for this February. For the first two months of the , China trade surplus totalled $120.7 billion,  the statement. The figure stood at $8.9 billion in the same period last , Customs data showed. \"We still see strong headwinds facing China exports this ,\" ANZ economists Liu Ligang and Zhou Hao  in a research note, pointing to a continuing contraction streak in export orders. The high increase in February exports was partly led by a low base in the same month last , when authorities also cracked down on overinvoicing by traders seeking to disguise capital flows, they added. Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday announced a lowered growth target of \"approximately seven percent\" for 2015, and underscoring concern the central People Bank of China last weekend cut benchmark interest rates for the second time in three months. Li also cut China trade growth target for this  to \"around six percent\", after trade expanded 3.4 percent last , below the 7.5 percent goal and the third consecutive  it had been missed amid softened domestic and foreign demand. China huge trade surpluses were long a source of friction with the United States as the workshop of the world pumped out manufactured goods and US debt mounted, but the issue has receded in more recent . In the JanuaryFebruary period, China exports to the European Union, the United States and the 10member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the top three trade partners of the country, increased by 13 percent, 21.2 percent and 38.4 percent respectively. But imports from all three regions declined, falling 10.3 percent with the EU, 16.7 percent with the US and 18.2 percent with the ASEAN countries, indicating domestic demand in China remained weak. China exports to Japan, with which it is embroiled in bitter disputes over maritime territory and wartime history, fell 4.1 percent in the twomonth period, while imports from the neighbour decreased by 13.8 percent.',\n",
       " 'Swiss Voters Reject Initiative to Replace VAT System With Carbon Tax By Neil MacLucas 8 March 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News ZURICHSwiss voters Sunday overwhelmingly rejected an initiative that would have scrapped the Alpine country valueaddedtax system and replaced it with a carbon tax, a move that would have made gasoline, heating oil and other forms of power more expensive for consumers. Roughly 92% of voters opposed the initiative, known as \"Energy Rather than VAT,\" while 8% supported the measure, according to preliminary results from 13 of the country 26 cantons. The initiative would have encouraged Swiss households to use renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, which would have been exempt from taxes. The initiative, which was introduced by the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland, was designed to help lower carbon emissions and reduce global warming. The Swiss cabinet had recommended voters reject the proposal because it would likely have caused a falloff in revenue for the federal government. The current VAT tax, which ranges from 2.5% to 8%, generated income of 22.6 billion Swiss francs ($22.92 billion) for the federal government in 2013, according to government data. The initiative was backed by the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland and supported by the Green Party of Switzerland, the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace Switzerland. Swiss voters also followed the government and parliament recommendation and rejected an initiative calling for the dropping of taxes on government subsidies to families with children. At present families receive at least 200 francs a month for each child under 16 , and 250 francs a month for children between 16  and 25  still undergoing education. Popular initiatives form a key part of Switzerland system of direct democracy, and are triggered when at least 100,000 signatures are collected to seek changes to the country constitution.',\n",
       " 'Gains and gaps in women fight for gender equality since 1995 – report By Lisa Anderson NEW YORK, March 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) In the past 20  the world women and girls have made significant progress in health, education and legal rights but wide gender gaps remain in economic participation, political leadership and security, according to research released Monday. An aggregation and analysis of global data drawn from a host of international agencies, including the World Bank, the World Health Organization, various U.N. agencies and polls, the research identifies gains and gaps in women progress towards gender equality since 1995. That  189 nations at the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women signed the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action calling for the \"full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life.\" The \"No Ceilings Full Participation Report\" is the result of a long global project led by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the No Ceilings initiative of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Its launch coincided with the start of the 59th session of the United Nations\\' Commission on the Status of Women. \"This report shows that progress is possibleand that more work remains,\" former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  in a statement launching the report. The data provide evidence that when women and girls participate fully, the positive effects create a ripple effect that increases wellbeing in communities, growth in economies and security in nations, the report . Among the most positive findings were those in health, edcuation and legal rights. Due to improvements in access to health care services, girls born today can expect to live an average of almost 73 , about four more  than in 1995, the report . The rate of global maternal mortality dropped by 42 percent in 20 ; the mortality rate for infant girls decreased by half and adolescent births fell by almost a third. More work needs to be done, however, in reducing HIV infections in women, which are nearly double the number in 1995, particularly among adolescent and young women. Also, more than 220 million women around the world want to use modern contraception but often lack access. In education, the report found that the global gender gap among primary schoolage children has \"virtually closed.\" But in secondary school, considered an  factor in girls\\' ability to avoid child marriage and contribute to their families and communities, the gender gap has narrowed but is still there; it is particularly wide in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of legal rights, more than 95 percent of the 56 national constitutions adopted after 1995 guarantee gender equality, compared with 79 percent in 1995. By 2013, 76 of 100 countries had passed laws against domestic violence, compared with 13 in 1995. Security is an area of great concern for women. Violence against women \"remains a global epidemic.\" Implementation and enforcement of laws protecting women are often lacking and laws restricting women rights still exist, the report found. Lack of progress is also worrying in women economic participation, which has virtually stagnated since 1995, with 55 percent of women in the workforce compared with 82 percent of men. Often working in the informal economy, women still earn less than men in almost every country. More than 150 countries lack laws guaranteeing equal access to capital and property ownership while nine nations legally restrict women freedom of movement. Although twice as many women hold political office now as in 1995, their political participation has grown relatively slowly. Women hold 22 percent of seats in national legislatures, an increase from 12 percent 20  ago. They also still are significantly rare in formal peace processes, where only 10 percent of peace negotiators are women. \"Data is knowledge and knowledge is powerin this case, the power to help women and girls build a better future,\" Melinda Gates, cofounder of the Gates Foundation,  in the preface to the report.

       " 'WTO Report Calls Abenomics Still Insufficient London, March 9 (Jiji Press)The expansionary monetary and fiscal policies under Abenomics, the economic policy package of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have been insufficient, the World Trade Organization  Monday. Referring to the first two arrows of Abenomics, the WTO  in a biennial trade policy review report for Japan that the monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and timely fiscal spending by the Japanese government \"have supported Japan economy but have been insufficient to achieve strong economic growth.\" While noting that Japanese authorities recognize that \"farreaching\" reforms are necessary to address longstanding structural problems and achieve sustainable growth in the future, the report , \"More is needed including further trade and investment liberalization measures so as to encourage private investment, increase productivity, and enhance competitiveness.\" The WTO discussed Abenomics in the report for the first time. Structural reforms are a centerpiece of the Japanese government growth strategy, the third arrow of Abenomics. \"Support and protection given to agriculture in Japan remains high compared to other countries,\" the latest report noted, adding that Japan is distorting production and trade, and boosting costs by using price support. \"Addressing many of these impediments to growth is the target of the third arrow of the current reform program and necessary if growth is to accelerate to a higher and sustainable level,\" the WTO added. Japan is aiming to press ahead with regulatory reforms, but measures taken so far are for dealing with \"relatively minor issues such as the elimination of the limits on floor area ratios,\" the report observed. The WTO urged Japan to pursue drastic regulatory reforms by using special zones in Tokyo and elsewhere.',\n",
       " \"Japanese Structural Reforms Require Greater Emphasis on Trade Liberalization By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 10, 2015 March 9 — Japan should do more to liberalize its trade and investment policies in addition to recent efforts to strengthen the country longterm structural issues, according to the World Trade Organization biennial trade policy review. “Overall, despite a long period of relatively weak economic performance and some severe shocks to the economy over the past few , Japan remains an open transparent economy—although support and protection in some areas, particularly agriculture, remain high,”  a summary of the WTO report. “Japan has many unique characteristics, some of which have helped it become the third richest country in the world, but others add to the cost of importing, exporting, investing, and doing business,” the WTO report . “Addressing many of these impediments to growth is the target of the third arrow of the current reform program and necessary if growth is to accelerate to a higher and sustainable level.” The twoday biennial review of Japan trade policies will continue on March 11. Modernization Efforts The WTO noted the significant efforts undertaken by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to “overcome deflation and revitalize its economy after more than a decade of sluggish performance.” Abe “three arrows strategy” consists of: monetary easing with the goal of achieving 2 percent inflation; fiscal stimulus of nearly $100 billion in January 2013 and an extra $53 billion in December 2013; and structural reforms in areas such as agriculture, energy and healthcare. U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Punke commended Abe modernization programs in a separate statement. “Meaningful structural reforms in Japan will lead to increased productivity, provide a renewed engine for economic growth, and help ameliorate global trade imbalances,” Punke wrote. The U.S. urged Japan to “remove nontariff barriers that impede foreign automotive manufacturers' ability to compete on a level playing field with their Japanese competitors; take actions to ensure Japan information technologies and communications market is open and promotes fair competition; ensure transparent and fair opportunities for foreign companies to compete for government procurement contracts; and ensure equivalent access for foreign companies to qualify for governmentfunded fiscal and incentive programs offered in specific sectors,” according to Punke statement. Overall Tariffs Decline Japan overall average tariffs on imports—the country main border protection measure—declined from 6.3 percent in fiscal  2012 to 5.8 in fiscal  2014. The 2014 decrease was “due to higher unit prices for many agricultural products which reduced the ad valorem equivalents” or duties not fixed as a percentage of a product import value, but rather in reference to the number or volume of the imported goods, the WTO . Japan average applied tariff for agricultural imports is 14.9 percent, down from 17.5 percent in fiscal  2012 and 3.7 percent for nonagricultural products, which was the same as in fiscal  2012. Persistent Trade Deficit Since 2011, Japan has had a persistent trade deficit—the longest since comparable records began, according to the WTO summary. In 2013, Japan had its biggest annual trade deficit, $118 billion, although exports increased in U.S. dollar terms while imports grew to their highestever level. Increased imports of fossil fuels were a major factor in the rise in imports as they replaced energy from nuclear power following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011 and the subsequent shutdown of other nuclear power plants, the report . The U.S.  it hopes to see more market access in Japanese policies regarding renewable energy products and services. Agricultural Policies Despite changes to Japan agricultural programs in recent , its agricultural support and protection policies remain high compared to other countries, the WTO summary . “While the government has continued to move toward income support, market price support is the main component and it, along with other transfers based on output and inputs, is potentially one of the most production and tradedistorting forms of support,” the review found. The U.S. commended Abe efforts to modernize the Japanese agriculture sector among other structural reforms aimed at boosting domestic growth. “The reforms of agriculture cooperatives that he has proposed are historic—if successfully implemented, they will be the first in six decades,” Punke . Information Technology Agreement Punke lauded Japan efforts to advance the Information Technology Agreement, a plurilateral deal to eliminate import tariffs on some 200 hightech products. The deal 54 members sought to conclude the deal last  following a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China to include a new list of products like GPS devices, medical equipment and multicomponent semiconductors. The deal ultimately collapsed when China rejected South Korea demands to eliminate duties on flatpanel displays, among other disagreements. The U.S.  Japan shares the view that the negotiations “should be finalized as soon as possible, so that we can move on to the  work of implementing an agreement and gaining its benefits.”\",\n",

       " 'India manages to defend raw sugar export subsidies at WTO, for now AMITI SEN TOMOJIT BASU Hindu BusinessLine Trade tangle The Food Ministry was recently sanctioned the first tranche of subsidy payment to sugar exporters Food Ministry expected to start disbursing ₹200 crore subsidies this month New Delhi, March 9: India has managed to ward off criticism at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for its raw sugar export subsidies by once again claiming that it has not made any payments under the programme. However, the country’s defence is unlikely to work for long as subsidy payments are slated to kickoff soon. The Food and Public Distribution Ministry was recently sanctioned the first tranche of subsidy payment due to exporters for last , a Food Ministry official told BusinessLine. “While no export subsidy payments have yet been made for the period between February (when the incentive scheme had been announced) and September 2014, the Ministry has now been sanctioned ₹200 crore (around $32 million) to be paid out to raw sugar exporters for the period,” the official . The subsidy payments, claimed by 80 sugar mills from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, is likely to be paid out from March 15, according to industry officials. Several WTO members, including the European Union, Australia and Colombia, were critical of India for announcing export subsidies for raw sugar in February last , accusing India of going against the understanding reached at the WTO’s Bali Ministerial meeting in December 2013, which  all export subsidies would be reduced and gradually eliminated. Since India is a major producer of sugar and also exports from timetotime, these countries claim that such export subsidies distort the world market. In the WTO committee of agriculture meeting last week, many countries questioned India about the recent announcement of increasing raw sugar export subsidy to ₹4,000/tonne in 2015 from ₹2,2773,371/tonne between February and September 2014. India’s representative reiterated the argument made in the last meeting that it was not answerable on the subsidies, as no payments had been made yet. On the EU’s question about its intention to give payments in the future, the India representative  it was only providing facts. India had earlier defended its raw sugar export subsidy programme on the grounds of encouraging sugar producers to diversify from refined to raw sugar. “This is a valid justification for our subsidy programme and we will reiterate it if our small subsidy payments are questioned,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine. Cane arrears Last , the Centre had announced a subsidy for exports of raw sugar up to 4 million tonnes to help the cashstarved industry clear cane arrears to farmers that have crossed ₹14,500 crore. The India Sugar Mills Association estimates production at 26 million tonnes in the current marketing , against last ’s 24.3 million tonnes.

As the United States, which leads the framework, will enter fullfledged campaign mode later this  for the 2016 presidential election, May is seen as an effective deadline for concluding the fiveold TransPacific Partnership talks. But gaps still remain over contentious issues, including intellectual property and establishing unified rules for fair business competition. The prospect is uncertain also due to little progress made during recent bilateral negotiations between Japan and the United States two largest economies in the TPP as well as the delay in debating a bill to grant President Barack Obama fasttrack authority to sign trade deals. Koji Tsuruoka, Japan chief TPP negotiator, told reporters before departing for Hawaii last week that prolonged U.S. debate on the socalled Trade Promotion Authority \"cannot help but affect the overall negotiations,\" suggesting progress may be limited during the Hawaii meeting. If the U.S. president is given TPA, the government will only need to ask Congress whether it backs a deal in its entirety without revision, meaning trade partners can be assured U.S. lawmakers will not demand amendments to the agreement contents. The other TPP countries are keeping an eye on what happens with the TPA bill before making major concessions on their sensitive issues, negotiation sources say. During a weeklong session in Hawaii, the chief negotiators will also engage in bilateral talks on remaining issues, including tariffs, on the sidelines of the plenary session. Japan and the United States are expected to resume workinglevel talks on market access for agricultural products, the most contentious issue between the two.

The chapters already closed are: competitiveness and business facilitation, cooperation and capacity building, crossborder trade in services, customs, development, regulatory coherence, small and medium enterprises, telecommunications and temporary entry, Australian chief negotiator Elizabeth Ward told an Australian Senate panel on Feb. 26. “At this stage that list is still current,” she . “A large number of other chapters are close to conclusion.” Ward did not respond directly when pressed by Senator Penny Wong of the opposition Labour Party to identify which chapters were close to conclusion. The list of completed chapters as cited by Ward shows that TPP countries have been able to close two – customs and crossborder trade in services – since the spring of last . At that time, Direcon, the Chilean trade agency, identified the other seven chapters Ward cited as the only ones that were already closed. The fact that the customs chapter is closed raises the question of whether and how TPP countries have resolved the controversial issue of the de minimis levels that each country will apply to express shipments. The U.S. had long pressed for TPP countries to establish a de minimis level of $200 for express shipments under which such shipments are exempt from duties, taxes and formal customs procedures – but other countries including Mexico had resisted that demand. The de minimis level is a key issue for express delivery companies like UPS and FedEx, both of which are closely monitoring the TPP negotiations. TPP countries have already begun the legal scrubbing of the chapters that have been closed. Sources have  this unusual step is intended to minimize the delay between the conclusion of the negotiations and the signing of the agreement, thereby allowing a speedier ratification by signatories. In addition, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman last month urged the International Trade Commission to begin work on the economic analysis of the TPP now and do it quicker than its previous chairman has  would be possible. Jan Adams, deputy secretary at Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, seemed to err on the side of caution in outlining the timeline for wrapping up the talks when testifying before the same Senate panel. “We think the TPP is close to conclusion,” she . “I think all of the 12 parties are working very intensely at the moment to aim to conclude in the next few months.” She  TPP countries are “working towards” the goal of concluding the negotiations at a ministerial meeting slated to take place in midApril. The meeting was earlier set for midMarch, but was pushed back by one month. One informed source  last week that there are already signs the ministerial could be delayed again, possibly to later in April or potentially May. On the intellectual property (IP) chapter, Adams reiterated that Australia current negotiating position is to not take on any commitments that would require it to change its current domestic law, including with respect to copyrights and the pharmaceutical benefits system (PBS), which subsidizes medicines for Australians. But she did not provide an ironclad commitment that the TPP would leave the PBS unchanged, despite being pressed by Wong to do so. Instead, Adams reiterated the Australian government position that it “will not accept adverse outcomes for the health system, PBS and the price of medicines.” At the same time, she acknowledged that other TPP parties had tabled IP proposals that would require changes to Australian law, and  the government had made “cost impacts” of those proposals. Among the Australian agencies involved in that effort are the departments of Health and Treasury, and IP Australia, she . Asked how the TPP would coexist with existing free trade agreements between parties, Adams  that generally the “higher” obligation would prevail. But in the event the two agreements conflict, TPP countries would have to work out how to address the issue in each specific case, she .',\n",
       " 'Colombia coffee growers demand financial help as prices slide By Peter Murphy BOGOTA, March 9 (Reuters) Colombia coffee growers are requesting government cash to help cover rising costs after a recent sharp fall in the price of arabica beans, a growers\\' representative  on Monday, as discontent resurfaces across Colombia farm sector. The Dignidad Cafetera movement, which led protests by coffee growers in 2013, wants the government to pay out 850 billion pesos ($327 million) of subsidies not disbursed last  after arabica prices shot above an agreed subsidy cutoff rate. Coffee growers met with two congressmen on Monday to discuss their financial difficulties after a 17 percent slide in arabica prices and to demand leftover subsidy cash be channeled into a fund that would top up farmer incomes when prices fall low enough. \"We are demanding that these 850 billion pesos are returned to create a stabilization fund to compensate for production costs,\"  Alonso Suarez, Dignidad Cafetera spokesman for Antioquia, one of Colombia biggest coffee regions. Suarez  the movement would also seek a meeting with Agriculture Minister Aurelio Iragorri to discuss their demands and  a repeat of protests in 2013, in which farmers blocked roads and refused to sell beans, was a \"last option.\" Colombia is the world top producer of mild, washed arabicas. The government is unlikely to be as receptive to requests for funds as it was two  ago. Its coffers have been shrunken by last  plunge in oil prices last  that prompted a hasty tax reform to ensure it could still pay bills. The dip in international prices for coffee has been offset by a weaker peso, which has lost more than a fifth of its value versus the dollar in a  and hit its weakest level since 2006 on Monday. But that also raises the cost of imports like fertilizer. The farmerfunded National Coffee Growers\\' Federation was not involved in Monday meeting, which included representatives from other agriculture sectors including cocoa, rice and plantain, who are also seeking government intervention. Arabica prices have plunged after fears subsided that world top coffee grower Brazil would face a shrunken, weatherhit crop for a second  in a row after rains recently ended a harsh dry spell and due to the weakening of the Brazilian currency.

       " 'Rich economies question faith in power of lower exchange rates Ferdinando Giugliano in London 9 March 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) The race to the bottom has begun. Confronted with disappointing growth rates, policy makers in some of the world largest economies are turning to currency devaluation in the hope this will trigger an exportled recovery. First came Japan, with the yen falling by just over 20 per cent against the dollar since the central bank launched a turbocharged programme of asset purchases in April 2013. Then it was the turn of the eurozone. The euro has slumped by a similar amount over the past  on the back of the European Central Bank own easing moves. Even Beijing may have now quietly decided to weaken the renminbi, after letting it appreciate against the dollar in the second half of last . The rationale behind these moves is that a lower exchange rate should help to boost the fortunes of domestic producers in two ways. First, a devaluation will make imports more expensive, leading consumers to ditch foreign goods for products made at home. Second, a depreciation should cheapen the relative price of exports, helping companies to find new customers abroad. \"The net impact on the economy is an improvement in economic growth,\" says Poonam Gupta, an economist at the World Bank. \"This is borne out strongly in the empirical work\" in economics, she adds. The faith in the power of lower exchange rates clashes, however, with the experience of a number of rich economies. During the financial crisis, sterling depreciated by over 25 per cent against a basket of currencies. Yet, even this has failed to spur any improvement in Britain current account. Similarly, the sharp reduction in the value of the yen has done little to boost the performance of Japanese goods abroad. One common explanation is that both the UK and Japan were unlucky in the timing of their devaluation. Britain saw sterling plunge just as the eurozone, its main export market, entered a long recession which nearly threatened its existence. Similarly, Japan has weakened its currency at a time of slowing demand in Asia. Without a steep depreciation so the argument goes the performance of British and Japanese exports would have been even worse. However, there is an alternative and possibly more dispiriting narrative: as exporting companies become more productive and move into higherquality segments of the market, their willingness to use a lower exchange rate to increase their market share abroad diminishes. Rather than seeking new customers by cutting their prices, entrepreneurs may hence prefer to keep them unchanged, pocketing higher profits. The evidence comes from a range of academic studies, looking at the pricing behaviour of companies across Belgium, France and Argentina. Mary Amiti, an economist at the Federal Reserve of New York, and her colleagues have shown that the multinational corporations that dominate international trade are less likely to adjust their prices in response to swings in the exchange rate. This evidence is backed up by another study by Philippe Martin, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris, and others which looks at French exporters. \"Larger and more productive companies do not decrease their prices by much in response to a devaluation,\" Mr Martin . \"They will increase their markups rather than their volumes,\" he added. Natalie Chen, a professor of economics at Warwick University, and Luciana Juvenal from the International Monetary Fund, show that companies producing highquality goods are also reluctant to cut prices abroad in the wake of devaluation. \"If exchangerate movements are more strongly absorbed into the export prices of higher quality goods, . . . exchangerate fluctuations have a less than proportional impact on aggregate trade prices and volumes,\" they wrote in a joint column for Vox.eu, a specialist website. These factors are not sufficient to wipe out the positive effects of a lower exchange rate. But they imply that countries that specialise in labourintensive, lowerquality goods such as China may have more to gain from cheapening their currency. For everyone else, the prize could well be smaller. END ________________________________',\n",
       " 'WTO to help settle Canadian trade rows with China, Taiwan 10 March 2015 Agence France Presse The World Trade Organization agreed Tuesday to create two expert panels to help settle Canadian rows with Taiwan and China over tariffs on steel pipes and cellulose pulp. In the first case, Taiwan had launched a complaint against Canada over duties on carbon steel welded pipes that Ottawa claims are being dumped on its market. Canada had blocked Taiwan initial request for WTO Dispute Settlement Body to create a panel to rule on the dispute, but with its second request, the panel was automatically set up in accordance with WTO rules. The WTO, which polices global trade accords in an effort to ensure a level playing field for its member economies, also automatically accepted Canada second request to create a panel to settle a dispute with China. Canada maintains that China is breaking WTO rules by imposing punitive tariffs on bleached wood pulp. Wood pulp, also called dissolving pulp, is typically spun into textile fibres or films. Last month, Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast announced the country first panel request, slamming \"China imposition of discriminatory antidumping measures on Canadian dissolving pulp.\" He insisted that an investigation by China to determine whether Canada sells the forestry product at slashed prices was flawed, and that the Asian giant bid to restrict Canadian imports was therefore unwarranted. Once created, WTO panels of independent trade and legal experts usually take several months to render their decisions. They can authorise retaliatory trade measures if they rule in favour of a plaintiff.',\n",

The two sides previously held formal WTO consultations over the matter in November, 2014 but the dispute remained unresolved. Russia expressed regret over the EU decision to convene a panel, as Moscow was ready to find a solution within the framework of ongoing consultations, the source added. The second request, which can be filed by the European Union on March 25, cannot be rejected. Russia joined the WTO in August 2012. Brussels has repeatedly accused Moscow of not meeting the commitments it undertook since becoming a WTO member. In total, at least four disputes have been initiated by the European Union against Russia, its third largest trading partner, within WTO frameworks, according to the organization website. For its part, Russia has initiated two disputes with the WTO against the European Union. The first, filed in late 2013, concerns antidumping measures imposed by the European Union on several products imported from Russia, including ammonium nitrate and steel products. The second, initiated in April 2014 is over measures applied by the EU relating to the socalled Third Energy Package.',\n",
       " \"WTO Delays Decision in EUU.S. Aircraft Case to Mid2016, Citing Complexity of Dispute By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 11, 2015 March 10 — The World Trade Organization needs additional time—until mid2016—to issue a decision in a longrunning European Union dispute over U.S. tax subsidies for Boeing Co. aircraft, according to a March 10 notice. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is investigating whether the U.S. complied with a panel 2012 recommendation that the U.S. amend its tax incentives to maintain compliance with WTO agreements (57 WTO, 3/26/12). The EU claimed that the U.S. continued to offer billions of dollars in tax subsidies for Boeing to manufacture its aircraft domestically despite the conclusions of the 2012 WTO panel decision. Last , the panel  it did not expect to complete its work before mid2015. The scale and complexity of the dispute required the panel to extend its timeline in reviewing the case another , according to the March 10 notice. Dispute Continues The announcement extends by one  the next milestone in the ongoing WTO investigations of the two members' respective aircraft manufacturing tax regimes. The cases stem from the dissolution of a 1992 bilateral EUU.S. agreement on trade in large civil aircraft that permitted each party to provide a certain level of support to their domestic aircraft industries. After the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2004, it filed and won a WTO dispute in which it claimed that EU member states offered illegal government subsidies to European aircraft consortium, Airbus Group NV. The EU then challenged the U.S. government subsidies for Boeing. The U.S. subsequently sought a compliance panel to determine whether the EU had failed to comply with the 2011 WTO decision. The EU  it had secured repayment of some $2.3 billion in launchaid loans and had terminated the loan agreements in question. A decision in that case is not expected until the end of 2015. 2015 Inquiry Begins The DSB in February granted a new inquiry into whether the U.S. again violated international trade obligations in 2013 by offering subsidies to Boeing. The EU alleged the U.S. offered $8.7 billion in tax subsidies to encourage Boeing to manufacture its 777X commercial aircraft in Washington state. The U.S. rejected an EU request to incorporate the most recent panel investigation into the pending dispute regarding U.S. compliance with the 2012 decision. The settlement body plans to issue a report within 90 days of the panel composition.\",\n",
       " \"WTO Agriculture Talks Resume March 20 on Market Access, Subsidies, Stockholding By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 11, 2015 March 10 — World Trade Organization members will convene later this month to discuss the status of their agricultural negotiations, according to Geneva trade officials. John Adank, the chairman of the WTO Agriculture Negotiating Committee in Special Session, scheduled two informal meetings to be held on March 20. The meetings are part of an ongoing effort to improve members' policies regarding market access and reduce tradedistorting domestic support in line with the goals of the Doha Development Agenda. Members will also discuss ways to find a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes. The work of the agricultural negotiating committee is considered a crucial component of the WTO effort to advance a detailed work program by July 31, with the goal of concluding the Doha round of negotiations. Adank has urged delegations to concentrate on practical possibilities for achieving the July 2015 target. Domestic Support In the first meeting, Adank will brief members on the latest negotiations regarding market access and domestic support policies. Although members have actively engaged on the domestic support issue, sharp disagreements between some developed and developing nations have emerged in recent weeks. Specifically, the U.S., India and China have failed to find consensus on the viability of the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4). The draft modalities are formulas for reducing tradedistorting measures, last revised in 2008. During an informal consultation March 6, China rejected a U.S. proposal for emerging economies to adjust their levels of tradedistorting domestic support in addition to the provisions outlined in Rev. 4 (45 WTO, 3/9/15). Chinese Ambassador Yu Jianhua  his government “would make no contribution toward new disciplines on domestic support,” according to officials at the meeting. Yu  on a per capita basis, Chinese farmers receive a much smaller fraction of agricultural subsidies when compared to the subsidies the U.S. provides to its farmers. Market Access Proposals Adank will likely brief members about a trio of proposals from Paraguay, Argentina and the European Union aimed at achieving agricultural tariff cuts. Paraguay proposal, which circulated last week in Geneva, suggested that developed countries could apply, in six equal annual installments, a maximum average cut of 54 percent and minimum cut of 20 percent per tariff line (43 WTO, 3/5/15). Under the proposal, developing countries could apply, in 11 equal annual installments, maximum average tariff cuts of 54 percent and a minimum cut of 15 percent per tariff line. Small and vulnerable economies and new WTO members could offer a maximum average cut of 24 percent. Argentina has circulated a proposal to consider offers and requests by individual members instead of a tariffreduction formula, and the European Union has called for a simplified approach based on average and minimum cuts. Food Stockpiling In a second meeting on March 20, Adank will urge members to find a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes. The U.S., EU, Brazil, Canada and Australia continue to oppose a proposal from the Group of 33 (G33) developing countries to categorize price support in the “green box” of nontrade distorting subsidies. Some developed countries believe that such a proposal would sanction trade distortion, in conflict with the terms of the Agreement on Agriculture. Under existing WTO rules, developing countries with stockholding programs for food security purposes must count any difference between the prices paid to farmers and external reference prices (dating from 198688) as tradedistorting subsidies. WTO members are prohibited from spending above a certain percentage of the value of their domestic agricultural production (de minimis limits) for these subsidies. Developing members like India are concerned that their public stockholding programs could be subject to WTO challenges because members have not updated the 198688 WTO pricing benchmark used to calculate tradedistorting measures related to agricultural subsidies. Disagreement over an interim agreement forged at the 2013 Bali Ministerial led India to oppose the Trade Facilitation Agreement last July (148 WTO, 8/1/14). In December, members agreed to extend indefinitely a socalled “peace clause” on developing countries' stockholding programs and set a Dec. 31, 2015, target to arrive at a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue (230 WTO, 12/1/14).\",\n",
       " 'India opposes move to reduce farm subsidies D. Ravi Kanth 11 March 2015 Mint Geneva, March 11 As tempers fray among key members at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in talks to cut farm subsidies, India has hit out at what it has called the \"dangerous suggestion\" being advanced by some powerful countries that China and India must reduce the minimum agricultural support they are currently allowed. India says the disciplines for reducing farm subsidies in the agriculture negotiations cannot be changed just because some memberssuch as the US and Canadafind it hard to scrap their current tradedistorting domestic farm subsidies. At a closeddoor meeting of a select group of trade envoys held last Friday at the WTO in Geneva, India criticized demands for reduction of socalled \"de minimis\"minimal amount of domestic supportfrom countries that had not given commitments to reduce their own subsidies. The chair for the socalled Doha agriculture negotiations, John Adank, called the meeting with trade envoys from the US, the European Union, China, India, Brazil, Japan, Canada, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, Indonesia, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico to prepare the blueprint for reducing tradedistorting domestic subsidies. During the meeting, the US and China also crossed swords, accusing each other of distorting global farm prices, particularly in cotton, a western trade envoy  on condition of anonymity. The US says China, with its one trillion dollarfarm economy, can now provide subsidies to the tune of $170 billion based on the current minimum entitlement of 17%. In turn, China told the US that it is willing to cap its farm subsidies at the same per capita level that is provided by Washington to its rich farmers$57,000. WTO allows de minimis support of 5% of the value of agricultural production (VoP) for developed countries and 10% for developing countries. The issue here is whether developing countries like India which assist their farm producers through de minimis support programmes must also reduce the level of support from the 10% they are currently allowed. The 10% limit enables developing countries to provide productspecific support for each agriculture item up to 10% of the VoP as well as nonproduct specific items to the tune of 10%. The current Doha Round of trade talks, which began in 2001, are a successor to the Uruguay Round and are aimed at setting the rules of world trade. They have been stalled over the issue of agricultural subsidies among others. India and China are not required to reduce their de minimis in the Doha Round as per a 2008 agreement. But the US is now demanding that China and India undertake appropriate commitments. The US has repeatedly argued that China and India, with their rising subsidies, are distorting global farm markets,  a trade envoy familiar with the meeting. Against this backdrop, India has called for disciplining the bound levels of aggregate measurement of support (AMS) because of its tradedistorting impact, while rejecting calls for reducing de minimis support for developing countries that did not undertake AMS commitments in the previous Uruguay Roundcountries like India and China. \"Some members are trying to divert attention from OTDS (overall trade distorting domestic support) concept because with their existing subsidies they will be breaching the new limits\" that will come into force with new revised draft modalities for agriculture, India has stated in its nonpaper. Such members include the US and Canada. \"Implicit in this argument is a dangerous suggestionfuture negotiations on domestic support should focus on cutting de minimis and not inter alia on reducing AMS limits,\" New Delhi has argued. India has carried out simulations based on the AMS and de minimis thresholds in the 2008 revised draft modalities in which industrialized countries are required to reduce their de minimis support to 2.5% from 5%. \"The imbalance in the existing AoA (agreement on agriculture) where only some members have access to bound AMS (such as the industrialized countries) allows them much more policy space visavis other members who have only de minimis,\" India has pointed out.',\n",
       " 'Big iron miners ‘self destructing’ The Australian 11 March 2015 theAustralian.com.au AUSTRALIA’S big iron ore miners are on a path towards “self destruction” and could find themselves with a case to answer in front of the WTO. Lourenco Goncalves, the chief executive of US iron ore miner Cliffs Natural Resources, told the Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast conference in Perth today the ongoing output growth by the likes of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and Brazil’s Vale was flawed. He noted the price plunge over the past 13 months — the result of a surge of iron ore supply from the majors — had wiped around $US50 billion of EBITDA from the world’s biggest iron ore miners. That $US50 billion could have been used to buy and shutdown Australian producers such as Fortescue, he argued, allowing prices to remain higher. “Because that was not done and the strategy was to drive prices down, Fortescue is still out there. They will have to keep these prices down forever, because even if everybody else in Australia goes broke, it doesn’t means that the assets won’t be bought by someone later and restarted,” Mr Goncalves . “The only way to keep these things down is by keeping prices down forever. I respectfully disagree with the strategy.” Since taking control of Cliffs through a board spill last , Mr Goncalves has set about exiting Cliffs from the seaborne iron ore business dominated by BHP, Rio and Vale and is instead concentrating on the domestic US market. Cliffs is trying to sell its Koolyanobbing iron ore mine in Western Australia, and has flagged the closure of the mine in four to five  should it fail to find a buyer. Mr Goncalves  the apparent strategy of the miners to drive out highercost producers in China and other nations could be “a difficult point if Australia had to defend that in the WTO”. “We are not against fair trade. We are just against unfair trade. We are against muscling out companies, pushing countries out of industries,” he . “Imagine if it were Russia trying to drive Japanese businesses out of business. It would not be that cool. In a world that’s flat, you’ve got to do to others only what someone else would do to you.”',\n",

AFLCIO President Richard Trumka  unions would keep a tally of how lawmakers voted on upcoming legislation allowing Congress to set negotiating objectives for trade deals in exchange for a yesorno vote, without amendments. The labor federation is also keeping an eye on voting on the 12nation TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. \"Every time there a loss of jobs because of an agreement like that, we will let people know who voted for and who voted against it,\" Trumka told reporters. All House of Representatives seats and onethird of the Senate are up for grabs in 2016, when Americans will also elect a new president. Trumka  the AFLCIO would include a question on trade in a questionnaire to be sent to presidential candidates. The TransPacific Partnership would only pass muster with unions if it contained rules against currency manipulation, did not have special protections for foreign investors and went further than the current norms in safeguarding workers\\' rights, he . Union pressure to vote against trade bills is at odds with lobbying from the administration in support of the trade agenda, which officials say will boost opportunities for U.S. producers and workers and lead to stronger worker protections among trading partners.

The heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other agencies welcomed \"ongoing efforts by many euro area countries to enhance their productivity, to raise employment and to improve fiscal positions,\" they  in a joint statement with Merkel. Further efforts are \"urgently needed across euro area member states\" to address youth employment, social inclusion and structural reforms, the statement . The statement follows the latest round of eurozone crisis talks last month, after a new Greek government sought an end to austerity measures imposed as part of the country international bailout. Germany, as 2015 leader of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, hosted the meeting, which was attended by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, as well as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary General Angel Gurria, World Trade Organization chief Roberto Azevedo and International Labour Organization DirectorGeneral Guy Ryder.

       " \"Argentina Proposes Solutions to WTO to Conclude Conflicts on Doha Round By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 12, 2015 March 11 — Argentina has proposed resolving ongoing conflicts at the World Trade Organization on the 2001 Doha round by permitting members to consider a negotiation approach to bilaterally, plurilaterally or multilaterally strike deals to reduce tariffs restrictions on goods and services. According to Argentina proposal, circulated among WTO members this week, such deals then could be extended on a most favored nation (MFN) basis. The proposal seeks to “overcome the main obstacles that have blocked progress” in WTO members' efforts to achieve the goals of the Doha Development Agenda and address the “fundamental shortcomings” with formulabased market access negotiations, Argentina . The proposal ultimately will help membership “build and keep an ongoing balance country by country with concrete demanddriven results,” Argentina . ‘Innovative Ideas.’ Argentina proposal would set a defined time period by which members may submit an initial request for specific trade terms. Each member may reply to each initial request by accepting, declining or offering a counter proposal. The process of requests and offers would continue until bilateral agreements are reached or desisted, the proposal . The terms of any bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral agreements would be submitted in written form to the WTO secretariat. Once agreed by consensus, the result of the negotiations would be bound in members' schedules of concessions in goods and services, the proposal . The final proposed result of the negotiating process would be consolidated by the secretariat in a single draft legal instrument containing the draft schedules of concessions of the Doha Round and, in line with the MFN principle, extended to the whole membership, according to the proposal. ‘WinWin Approach.’ A request and offer approach would permit all members “to tailor their requests on the basis of the specific and often limited list of products they export—or intend to export—while those members who want to negotiate bilaterally using any formula would be able to do it bilaterally without any ex ante requirement...to make cuts based on any formula,” the proposal . Under such an approach no member would be required to give market access if it is not satisfied with the market access to other members' markets offered in exchange, Argentina . Argentina  the proposal would simplify the negotiation process “since no exceptional provisions are required to address a request and offer negotiation at all.” A request and offer structure would enable each member to “negotiate with certainty” because they will be directly involved in bilateral negotiations that permit them to ask for and offer what they need and can deliver, the proposal . The proposal also would enable members to address nontariff import restrictions such as technical import barriers that cannot be dealt with under a formula approach, Argentina . Scope Parameters The scope of Argentina proposal includes goods negotiations of agricultural and nonagricultural products and services negotiations. Request and offer goods negotiations would include: bound tariffs, and/or bound tariff rate quotas, and/or MFN tariff rate quotas, and/or unbound tariffs. Request and offer services negotiations would include: commitments of sectors not bound in members' schedules, removal of existing limitations or reduction in the level of restrictiveness of modes so far unbound, undertaking additional commitments under Article XVIII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and termination of MFN exemptions. Request and offer negotiations “shall neither be subject to any parameters or benchmarks of any kind, nor create new import restrictions,” the proposal . Special and Differential Treatment Argentina proposal would incorporate special and differential treatment for developing countries including less than full reciprocity, the proposal . Leastdeveloping countries will be “neither required nor expected to undertake commitments in market access negotiation whereas these countries will have the opportunity of greater market access results through their requests and the MFN treatment,” the proposal .

Ravi Kanth 12 March 2015 Mint Geneva, March 12 Even as India and Japan are forging strong trade and economic ties, India pharmaceutical companies and information technology (IT) services providers continue to face \"specific\" hurdles to enter the Japanese market because of its \"stringent\" and time consuming regulatory requirements. India raised specific concerns faced by its companies in the Japanese market at the World Trade Organization (WTO) during the 12th trade policy review (TPR) of Japan which concluded on Wednesday. The TPR process enables members to review the macroeconomic and trade policies of a country under review. It also allows WTO members to raise their immediate trade policy concerns in the country whose trade policies are being examined. Around 700 questions were raised by some 40 countries about the specific problems faced by their traders and companies in the Japanese market. \"In the pharmaceutical sector, India companies are unable to access the Japanese market due to stringent and time consuming regulatory requirements, including requirement for an India company to have joint venture with a Japanese company and the need for commercial presence for applying to Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency,\" an India official  at the meeting. India drew attention to the \"the stringent maximum residue levels for chemical products, including agrochemicals, additives for food products act as market entry barriers for our exporters\". India IT firms, according to the India official, face several hurdles in the Japanese IT services market due to the \"Keiretsu\" model that prohibits India IT entities from directly approaching customers in Japan. \"As a result, they often end up as tertiary service providers despite their competitive strengths in this sector,\" India complained. Several other countries spoke against Japan tradedistorting agriculture policies, particularly high subsidies and tariffs, and nontariff barriers. A senior Japanese trade official assured members that Tokyo is \"committed\" to further trade liberalization. Japan is currently engaged in negotiations to conclude a total of 16 investment agreements. Ahead of the review, the WTO secretariat issued a comprehensive report on the country under review. The WTO has praised Japan for pursuing bold economic policies to reverse deflation and revitalize its economy. The report spoke positively about the \"three arrows\" strategyinvolving bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, and growth strategiesbeing pursued by the Japanese government.',\n",
       " 'Unfazed by US objections, Centre to go ahead with buylocal rule for solar M Ramesh 12 March 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) 3,000 MW of solar photo voltaic capacity up for grabs in Batch II of Phase II Undeterred by the ongoing battle at the WTO over the mandatory buylocal rule for solar power projects, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has decided to go ahead with similar provisions for the award of the next set of solar power projects. Coming up next is PhaseII, BatchII of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, where 3,000 MW of solar photo voltaic capacity will be up for grabs through a bidding process. The chunk will be divided into lots and allocated to various States, and projects of at least 10 MW in size will be awarded to those bidders who offer to sell the power cheapest to the Stateowned power trading company, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN). The guidelines for Phase II Batch II, released by the Ministry on Tuesday,  the Ministry will prescribe the “domestic content requirement” (DCR) for each State. As in the case of the previous round of bidding, (Phase II Batch I, where 750 MW of capacity was distributed to winners), bidders may bid for ‘DCR’ or ‘open’. India’s DCR rule has particularly irked the US, leading it to complain to the WTO. The case is underway, but the Centre is unfazed. India’s defence stands on two legs — that the quantum of projects required to buy local cells and modules is very small, and that in any case it is only a Stateowned company that is buying the power, and the WTO allows buylocal rules when applied to government procurement. The guidelines  that for plants using crystalline silicon, the cells and the modules (modules are made with cells) should be produced in India. For ‘thin film’, the entire module must be made in India, though import of the substrate is permitted. Narender Surana, Managing Director of module manufacturer Surana Solar, felt the guidelines should have been further refined. A part of projects to be awarded under the ‘DCR route’ should be permitted to use modules made in India using imported cells, he . CUF cap A noteworthy feature of the guidelines is the Capacity Utilisation Factor (CUF) cap. The Ministry will prescribe a CUF ceiling, which practically means a cap on the number of kWhr of electricity generated. Generation beyond the limit will be paid only Rs. 3 a kWhr, though the plant owner can sell surplus power to third parties. Experts such as Raveesh Budania of Headway Solar, a Delhibased solar consultancy, have welcomed the move, noting that such a ‘cap’ will discourage the practice of developers building plants that actually have higher capacity than awarded, so that they generate more and earn more. After all, it is impossible for the Ministry to monitor the capacity of every plant. Hence it is saying, if you overgenerate, we will pay you only Rs. 3. It is good for the developers too because they may add to the capacity at any time and sell the surplus power directly to consumers, noted Budania. The guidelines also fix a limit on the tariff — it shall not exceed that prescribed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The winners will have 210 days from the date of signing the power purchase agreement to construct the project. India’s DCR rule has particularly irked the US, leading it to complain to the WTO.',\n",

The U.S. formally requested consultations on Feb. 11 in what the administration touted as a major enforcement announcement. Under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM), a party can request a panel if a dispute over prohibited subsidies is not resolved within 30 days of the consultation request.

Lawmakers in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, on March 11 voted 367 to 113 in favor of the legislation, which would also apply to handrolled tobacco. The legislation also requires approval from the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, which is due to vote on Monday. The vote is a blow to the $780 billion tobacco industry, which is grappling with declining smoking rates and growing use of ecigarettes. The legality of removing brand imagery is still in question, with challenges moving through the World Trade Organization (38 WTO, 2/26/15). “Plain packs are the single biggest regulatory threat out there because it threatens the pricing power that has made this industry so profitable for so long,” Philip Gorham, an Amsterdambased analyst at Morningstar Inc.,  in an email. Prime Minister David Cameron government announced its intention in January to push through the legislation before the May 7 general election. If passed, the new rules will take effect in May 2016, bringing the country into line with Australia and Ireland. The proposed rules will require cigarettes and tobacco to be sold in dull brown packets with white interiors, with specified text only, such as the brand. The packs would continue to carry health warnings. Legal Action Bristol, Englandbased Imperial Tobacco, the largest U.K. cigarette maker, whose brands include Davidoff,  in an email that while the legislation still needs the goahead from the Lords, the company would “defend our legal rights in court.” Japan Tobacco Inc., maker of Camel cigarettes, and BAT also will challenge the policy through legal channels, the companies both . “This legislation is a case of the UK Government taking property from a UK business without paying for it,” Jerome Abelman, BAT Corporate and Regulatory Affairs Director,  in a statement. Plain packaging puts the brand identity of tobacco companies—and their corresponding ability to charge more for some brands than others—at risk, Morningstar Gorham . Smokers in Australia have traded down since plain packaging legislation was introduced in the country, he . The French and New Zealand governments have  that they want similar legislation, but most countries are holding off on passing new laws in anticipation of a ruling on the matter by the WTO, which isn't expected until the second half of 2016.

       " 'Russia considers softening food import ban, minister says 11 March 2015 MTI EcoNews Budapest, March 11, 2015 (MTIEconews) RussianAgriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov  his ministry was considering softening its ban on food imports from a series of European Union countries, first of all from Greece, Hungary and Cyprus, and the move was close to implementation, Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday. The embargo was introduced last August in response to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis. Moscow is \"in intense discussions on different possibilities to answer the question of whether we can find a positive answer to liberalize shipments of products to our market. There are options, which we are discussing, there are two or three options, which are close to possible implementation,\" the minister , adding that Russia wants to find a solution which would not alienate the EU. \"We are actively investigating to see what civilised opportunities there are to their proposals,\" Mr Fyodorov told journalists in Moscow. \"If we help them, we would not want to create problems for them in their relations with Brussels,\" Interfax quoted the minister as saying. Russia intention to soften the food embargo was first aired by Minister of Economic Development Alexey Ulyukayev two weeks ago. Russia will explore ways of softening the food embargo for Hungary and Greece consistent with WTO norms, Russian news agencies TASS and RIA Novosty quoted Mr Ulyukayev on March 3. Mr Ulyukayev emphasised the Russian government was looking into the matter after these countries asked it to revoke the ban. \"We need to find a decision consistent with WTO norms. It is impossible to simply make exceptions for particular countries,\" the Russian minister , but added that \"I cannot rule out we can even partly resort to unilateral measures if our partners properly perceive them.\" Solutions are explored making possible for goods from these nations to enter the Russian market through processing or tolling mechanisms, Mr Ulyukayev . The Hungarian economy has suffered losses of nearly EUR 300,000 a day as a result of the Russian food embargo, Hungary minister for foreign affairs and trade  in an interview with Slovak business daily Hospodarske Noviny published in October last .

Das NEW DELHI, March 11 (Reuters) India trade ministry has recommended antidumping duties ranging from $180 to $306 per tonne for some industrialgrade stainless steel imported from China, Malaysia and South Korea in a bid to protect local industry. After a long investigation based on complaints from Jindal Stainless Ltd, the trade ministry  it found that the domestic industry was suffering \"material injury due to such dumped imports\" and that a definitive measure was required to stop it. (http://bit.ly/18AnkfU [http://bit.ly/18AnkfU]) The recommendations, made public on Wednesday, are expected to be implemented by the finance ministry within three weeks and will stem the flow of surging imports, N.C. Mathur, president of the India Stainless Steel Development Association, . Mathur  the grades subject to the dumping duty can cost $1,270$2,070 per tonne and are used mainly to make equipment for industries like dairy, oil refinery and railways. India consumes about 1 million tonne of this type of stainless steel and more than 40 percent of that is imported, mainly from China, a trade which is growing at up to 15 percent a . China annual stainless steel surplus is more than 4 million tonnes, compared with India annual demand of about 2.6 million tonnes and which leads to cheap supplies coming in from China, Mathur . Steelmakers from Asia to Europe are facing increasing pressure from a rise in cheap imports as Russia and Ukraine, armed with weaker currencies, join China in pushing surplus output on to world markets. Many steel companies in India, such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Kalyani Steels, have seen profits come under pressure. Jindal Stainless shares ended up 10 percent at 40.50 rupees on Wednesday on the duty recommendations, their highest closing price in 2.5 months. Mathur  the steel industry also welcomed the government decision to provide for an increase in the import duty on steel to 15 percent without any major procedural delays. Earlier, the government had set a limit of 10 percent while the actual duties are below that. The provision will allow the government to raise the duty whenever it wants just with a notification, Mathur . (Editing by Jane Merriman)',\n",

China steel exports rose 50.5 percent last  to a record 94 million tonnes, or about a quarter of world exports. The increase has sparked a chorus of calls around the globe for action to protect local steel industries. This  alone, measures taken to protect steelmakers have been taken in the European Union, Indonesia, India, Turkey, and now Iran. \"A steel import tax has been imposed ... to protect local steel mills against dumping of China, Russia and Turkey,\"  Keyvan Ja\\'fari Tehrani, head of international affairs at the Iranian Iron Ore Producers and Exporters Association (IRIOPEX). There was no reply from Iran Ministry of Mine, Trade and Industry to Reuters emails. Metal Expert, an information agency, showed Reuters a copy of the Iranian customs decree. The duties, which will apply to products such as billet, hot rolled coil, wire rod and rebar, are in line with Iran ambitious 2025 vision plan to quadruple its steel output. They are also in line with a bid to diversify the country economy away from oil, make it more selfsufficient, and shield it better from Western sanctions over Tehran disputed nuclear programme. \"Some believe that duties of 20 percent on rebar and 10 percent on billets cannot stop the tide of subsidized Chinese steel exports, and higher tariffs are required,\"  Bahador Ahramian, a board member of IRIOPEX and the Iran Steel Producers Association. Tehran is anxious to protect its steel and iron ore sector. It is seen as strategic in that it supplies dozens of related industries, including construction and oil. In addition to raising steel import duties, Iran has banned importers from buying foreign currency at the official exchange rate, usually about 20 percent below the market rate.

       " \"U.S. Negotiates IP Side Letters To Gain Support For TPP Pharmaceutical Demands World Trade Online Posted: March 11, 2015 Waikoloa, HAWAII – The United States is in the process of bilaterally negotiating secret side letters with several TransPacific Partnership (TPP) countries, including Chile, that would provide them with favorable clarifications on key intellectual property (IP) issues in return for their cooperation in setting stringent IP rules in a final deal, according to informed sources. Some sources  this side letter effort appears to be part of a “divide and conquer” strategy by U.S. negotiators intended to splinter what was once a united front of TPP countries opposed to U.S. demands on IP, particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals. On Tuesday (March 10), U.S. IP negotiators held bilateral meetings here with their counterparts from several TPP countries, including Australia and Canada. One informed source  the side letters the U.S. is negotiating with other TPP countries may cover areas other than IP. This source emphasized that it is  for U.S. lawmakers to know the content of these side letters in order to evaluate the TPP agreement in its entirety. In the case of Chile, the side letter under negotiation relates to patent linkage, which is a longstanding issue of contention between the two countries stemming from their 2004 bilateral free trade agreement. The letter would clarify that, for Chile, the obligations on patent linkage in the bilateral FTA would take precedence over those included in a final TPP agreement, sources . This effectively means that Chile would be exempted from the TPP provisions on patent linkage. The TPP language on patent linkage is largely similar to the Chile FTA, but the side letter has the apparent benefit for Chile of allowing it to avoid pressure from the U.S. to make changes to its patent linkage system as a prerequisite for bringing the TPP into force. The U.S. government and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of American (PhRMA) have long argued that Chile has not complied with the patent linkage provisions in the bilateral FTA, a position that the Chilean government has rejected in the past. The planned side letter would not resolve that dispute over Chile compliance with the FTA, according to one informed source. Patent linkage generally refers to a system in which a country health regulator holds off on granting marketing approval for a generic drug until the patent for the related brandname drug expires or is found to be invalid through litigation. Typically, the decision on marketing approval is stayed until the completion of litigation between the generic and brandname producers over whether the patent is being infringed upon. Other TPP countries such as Mexico are also seeking favorable clarifications from the U.S. on specific IP issues, according to informed sources. They  it was conceivable these could be done in the form of side letters. For instance, Mexico has sought a clarification that its current patent linkage system would comply with the TPP obligations and therefore would not have to be changed. The main bone of contention with the Mexican linkage system relates to its scope of coverage. When Mexico initially implemented patent linkage via decree in 2003, it only applied to patents for new chemical entities, not to patents for new formulations or new uses. Following a 2010 ruling by its Supreme Court, Mexico expanded the scope of its linkage system to apply to patents for new formulations. But Mexican health regulator COFEPRIS still retains flexibility not to apply linkage to patents for new uses. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has not called for improvements in Mexico patent linkage system in its annual Special 301 report on foreign countries' IP practices since 2012. However, PhRMA has pressed for Mexico to expand the scope of its patent linkage system to cover patents for new uses, and included this demand in its February submission to USTR for the upcoming 2015 Special 301 report. “PhRMA members encourage Mexican authorities to establish uniform criteria consistent with Court precedents ordering the listing of use patents in the Official Gazette,” the group . Such a listing is required for patents to be subject to the linkage system. Another area that could be subject to demands for clarification by TPP countries is a proposed requirement that parties provide an additional three  of data exclusivity for “new clinical information” that is submitted in connection with an application for a new marketing approval based on a previously approved drug. This is on top of the five exclusivity period that countries would be required to provide for test data initially submitted by a brandname drug company to prove the safety and efficacy of its drug. Some critics of this provision fear that brandname drug companies would repeatedly submit new clinical information in an effort to extend their period of data exclusivity indefinitely – a form of socalled “evergreening.” One way to ease these fears would be for the U.S. to clarify that this additional three period could only be invoked one time, meaning that the maximum term of data exclusivity for small molecule drugs would be eight , according to an informed source. The main dispute surrounding Chile compliance with the FTA obligation on patent linkage is that the Chilean system does not allow the health regulator to stay marketing approval of a generic drug unless there has been an injunction issued by a court. According to an industry source, brandname drug makers do not have legal standing to seek such an injunction in Chilean courts until the generic drug enters the market. As a result, PhRMA argues, Chile system fails to meet the main goal of patent linkage, which is to provide brandname drug makers recourse to challenge generic drugs as infringing before they enter the market. Protecting Chile against U.S. demands on patent linkage in the context of TPP implementation would be helpful because the implementing legislation for the most recent U.S. free trade deals states that the agreement will not enter into force for a country until the U.S. president has certified the trading partner has complied with all its provisions. The Chilean government, Chilean lawmakers and stakeholders in the country have objected to this socalled “certification requirement” as giving the U.S. the ultimate authority in determining whether other trading partners' legislation brings them in line with the terms of the agreement and the leverage to demand changes to those laws by withholding entry into force.\",\n",

Western sanctions introduced against Russia come in violation of international law and the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the speaker of Russias lower house of parliament, the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin  on Thursday. The sanctions policy is in fact a price the national business has to pay for foreign policy mistakes and miscalculations of the Western states governments, Naryshkin . These mistakes and miscalculations include both the dreaming of ones about hegemony and a unipolar world and the inability to resist such dreaming by the others, who forget about national interests of their own business, he explained. I believe that the antiRussian approach is wrong and it is completely illegal and violates the norms of the international law and the norms of the WTO, Naryshkin . The lower house speaker noted that sanctions have both undermined trust and violated a number of intergovernmental agreements and broken the system of international law as a whole. They have already inflicted certain damage on both the business and the citizens of our countries, he added. The sanctions, which the Western countries have introduced against Russia in order to punish Moscow for its stance on Ukraine, have only bolstered the socalled party of war in Kiev, he . Russian officials and companies came under the first batch of Western sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, after Russia incorporated Crimea in midMarch 2014 after the February 2014 coup. The West announced new, sectoral, restrictions against Russia in late July 2014, in particular, for what the West claimed was Moscows alleged involvement in protests in Ukraines southeast. In response, Russia imposed on August 6, 2014 a one ban on imports of beef, pork, poultry, fish, cheeses, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United States and Norway.

A new dispute could further harm trade ties frayed by an EU case against Brazil over duties on industrial imports and stalled freetrade talks with the regional trade bloc, Mercosur. Fernando Sampaio, the executive director of Brazils meat exporters association, ABIEC,  unnecessary sanitary requirements have reduced Brazils beef exports to the EU by three quarters to 100,000 tonnes a . From the sanitary point of view it makes no sense, they are just creating bureaucratic barriers to leave our producers out of the market, Sampaio . We are studying opening a WTO panel against the EU because of all these barriers. The Brazilian government, known for its trade protectionism, is turning the heat up on commercial disputes in a bid to open more markets for its exports after the commodities powerhouse posted its first trade deficit in 14  in 2014. In October, the worlds largest beef exporter launched a WTO dispute against Indonesia over barriers to its poultry meat exports. The government is preparing another case against Jakarta over beef exports. Brazilian beef exporters need the green light from the government for the country to launch a case against the EU. Presidents Dilma Rousseff administration has not ruled out launching the dispute, but will first exhaust all negotiation options, two government officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. Our main objective is to remove those barriers through bilateral negotiations, but if that fails we do not rule out opening a case,  one official who asked not to be named to speak freely. Brazils Agriculture Ministry declined to comment. The Foreign Affairs Ministry  it has not received a formal request from exporters to open a case. Brazilian producers complain the EU refuses to allow beef exports from states that have been free of foot and mouth disease for over a decade. Resistance to the entry of Brazilian agricultural products has been one of the main obstacles in regional free trade talks with the EU, which have dragged on for two decades. Brasilias refusal to open its industrial market is another impediment. The EU opened a WTO case in 2013 over Brazilian taxes on imports from cars to computers. (Editing by Bernadette Baum)',\n",
       " 'Ireland warned over packaging and political instability; The Foreign Trade Council president advises Ireland to hold off until the WTO case against Australia is settled By Charlie Taylor, The Irish Times 13 mars 2015, Ireland will continue to be a leading beneficiary of US foreign direct investment (FDI) but risks alienating investors by backing plain packaging for cigarettes and through possible political instability. That is according to William Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council and a former undersecretary of commerce for export administration under President Bill Clinton. After addressing a conference in Dublin discussing the strength of the Irish economy, Mr Reinsch  Government backing for plain packaging could be seen in a negative light by companies considering investing here. The Irish Government is capable of either weakening or strengthening its appeal to investors and arguably the plain packaging issue is something that is an example of it doing the former, he . From an American perspective, this is not about health policy but about intellectual property protection. IP is a companys crown jewels and the feeling is that the plainpackaging issue is not just about cigarettes. Tobacco is seen as the first tranche but there are other tranches planned and so it is seen as something of a slippery slope because, if youre going to say we believe in IP protection but that there are some instances where we dont believe in it quite so much, then that really raises the question of where you draw the line. Were trying to advise countries around the world to hold off fully implementing a ban on packaging until the WTO case against Australia is settled. New Zealand has done that and other countries are also considering it and it would be good if Ireland also waited, he added. Admitting that the body he represented included a tobacco company as members, Mr Reinsch  the issue of plain packaging went beyond those firms who had most to lose from the its introduction. We believe trade rules should trump health and other policies and generally this is the kind of thing that makes people raise an eyebrow and find worrisome. Mr Reinsch  Ireland remained an attractive destination for FDI but that this could be threatened by the decision by individual states in the US to introduce new reforms that penalise companies operating in socalled tax havens. There are many states introducing new legislation that include a list of countries deemed havens and then taxes companies operating in those jurisdictions. So far, Ireland has managed to stay off those lists but it has been proposed a number of times. I believe from discussions with the Minister for Finance that the Government recently persuaded the state of Maine to remove the country from a list on its draft legislation, but it has to continue to keep on top of this, he . Ireland has a good argument to say it is not a haven and my sense is the Government is on top of the issue, but there are 50 states [in the US] so it needs to make sure it keeps up to date on new legislation being proposed. Mr Reinsch  investors had been impressed by the consistency shown by successive governments in Ireland but warned that political instability could lead investors to reconsidering investing here. Im not an expert on Irish politics and it seems to me that there are other countries in which it is more of a pressing issue, but nonetheless, political instability is something thats offputting to investors. One of the best things that Ireland has done over the  is to stay the course and be consistent. It has held firm on the issue of its corporate tax rate and has shown a remarkable degree of consistency regardless of election results. I think that even if the election brings about substantial change, investors wont do anything dramatic because theres such a good track record but, at the same time, there are lots of places to put capital and youre only as good as what you  five minutes ago in this game, he .',\n",

The sectors that have been selected include electric products & electronics, textiles & leather, food and agriculture products, building & construction and chemicals & petrochemicals, Chandan Bahl from the Bureau of India Standards told BusinessLine .

Quality barriers SAARC includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Difference in quality norms in importing countries have been identified by exporters as a significant nontariff barrier that restricts free flow of goods in the region. The harmonisation of standards is being carried out by the South Asian Regional Standards Organisation (SARSO), a SAARC specialised body, which became operational in Dhaka from April 2014. It often takes time for inspections to take place when goods are being exported from one country to the other. Harmonising standards could take care of the problem to a great extent, Bahl . Pakistan, for instance, has been complaining about not being able to export cement to India freely as India inspectors dont come to the country to examine their consignments on time. This happens sometimes because we have problems in getting travel approvals from the Ministry of External Affairs, another official pointed out.

It (environmental standards) could be a big nontariff trade barrier, Cristobal told reporters at a forum on Greening the Philippine Manufacturing Industry Roadmap, noting that a deal on environment is being pushed already at the World Trade Organization (WTO) although there is no official talk yet. EU and US and other developed countries are quite advanced in terms of their environmental standards. Trade blocs with high level ambitions like the Trans Pacific Partnership have also included environmental standards in their agreements. If we are not going to adapt these environmental standards we will have a hard time exporting some products especially to Europe, Cristobal  adding there is a bigger need to create awareness about these things. It is  we create awareness about these things, education then of course requires resources big upfront investments but in the long term youll see the savings in your investment, he  noting that the global trend is really going towards the implementation of environmental standards.

Australias biggestever bilateral trade deal is set to grow much bigger, with China agreeing to a special ratchet clause that will ensure that future benefits conferred to other countries will flow automatically to Australia. The muchcoveted most favoured nation provisions in the ChinaAustralia Free Trade Agreement have been kept under wraps at the request of Chinese negotiators, who were pursuing a parallel deal with South Korea. Trade Minister Andrew Robb confirmed the MFN provisions in an interview with Fairfax Media. This is huge, I think,  Mr Robb. It means that we will automatically receive the same treatment provided by China to any other country in the future including the EU and the United States. Australian negotiators, analysts and industry bodies were HYPERLINK \"http://www.smh.com.au/federalpolitics/politicalnews/tonyabbottsealsfreetradedealwithbeijing2014111611nsk9.html\"surprised at the range of liberalisation commitments that China committed to during President Xi Jinpings visit to Canberra in November. The full text, which will not be released until later this , will include unprecedented commitments over a range of service sectors, including education and financial services. Some China analysts speculated that Mr Xi may have been using the Australia trade deal as a lever to liberalise his own economy, which is starting to strain under the weight of bad debts and rash investments. The previously unreported MFN mechanisms take the deal to another level. Australian negotiators are most enthused by potential MFN gains on the investment side. The prize will be a special negative list feature that China looks set to provide the US under a bilateral investment treaty, which would greatly increase the range of Australian investment opportunities. Similarly, Australian fund managers could potentially gain majority ownership rights in Chinese counterpart firms, up from a ceiling of 49 per cent in the existing FTA, if the US manages to get what it is seeking. This MFN clause was something we had long sought but didnt really believe we could get,  Geoff Raby, the former ambassador to China who had been involved with negotiations for a decade before stepping down to take on corporate directorships and advisory roles. It is a big achievement by Robb and the team to have secured this. Mr Robb told Fairfax Media the MFN provisions would apply to investment and services chapters. He  a separate review mechanism had been built into the goods provisions, which would apply three  after the agreement entered into force and then every five  thereafter. On most fronts, if not all, those will be protected, locked in, in the future when China make concessions with other countries, Mr Robb . Overall this means we have substantially [greater] preferential arrangements than any other trading partner. Dr Raby, a director of Fortescue,  there had been considerable political resistance on both sides when he first floated the idea of a China trade deal to his ministers in 2003, when the Howard government was concluding a trade deal with the US. He  Chinese officials had been been anxious that they had paid too high a price for accession to the World Trade Organisation and Australians were unhappy at having to grant China market economy status even before negotiations had begun. It was the first time a developed country had engaged China on this idea, he . Dr Raby  the MFN provisions would be particularly  for investors because China was negotiating an ambitious bilateral investment agreement with the US. It is extremely valuable as it preserves our position as China negotiates other FTAs so the benefits which we have paid for in the negotiations cant be whittled away, Dr Raby . The chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott,  the MFN deal would keep Australia on a level playing field with key competitors for valuable trade with what is the growth engine of the world. This opens the door to deep access to Chinese markets and a greater capacity to further diversify the Australian economy, she . Former Austrade chief economist Tim Harcourt agreed that the China deal had surpassed expectations but also warned that great challenges lay ahead in the implementation. At the end of the day its the internal decisions you have to deal with in China, where so much is determined by administrative fiat,  Dr Harcourt, now a lecturer and researcher in the MBA program at the University of NSW. FTA or no FTA, you still have to have those connections to get your deal up, he . Youve got to have the [Chinese Communist Partys] blessing right down through the ranks.',\n",

Hosted by the US consulate general, Calcutta, the Center on American and Global Security (Indiaa University) and the Observer Research Foundation, the core objective of the twoday conference was to underscore the importance of intraregional connectivity for south and southeast Asia. He highlighted the agreement being processed between India and the US Agency for International Development to establish a publicprivate partnership with key US, India and international organisations to create an inclusive digital economy and stressed the need for India to step up. The country, he , ought to rely on its tradition of peaceful democratic change and constructive dissent to play a leadership role in the region, where domestic political sensitivities, corruption and bilateral irritants all present roadblocks for better regional connectivity. Mentioning the negligible volume of south Asias intraregional commerce, Verma suggested addressing the economic anomaly to create opportunities for the region. By some estimates, south Asia intraregional commerce comprises only 5 per cent of total global trade. India trades more with Europe, the US, and the Middle East than with its immediate south Asian neighbours. Addressing this economic anomaly will involve overcoming some challenges, but if we do it will also crate enormous opportunities for all involved,  Verma.',\n",
       " 'US government procurement: Pakistan obtains observer status By MUSHTAQ GHUMMAN, Business Recorder 13 mars 2015, United States (US) has allowed Pakistani companies to participate in government procurement with the approval of the US President as Pakistan has obtained observer status in government procurement group of the WTO. This was stated by Commerce Minister, Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan at a press conference that he addressed along with Secretary Commerce Shahzad Arbab, Additional Secretary, Rubina Athar and Economic Minister to the US. According to the Minister when Pakistan raised the issue that as trade concessions are not being extended to Pakistan then how trade relationship between Islamabad and Washington can move forward he was told that Pakistani companies were permitted to bid in US government procurement which is around $1.7 trillion. Pakistan was informed that to avail of this facility it must sign the Government Procurement Agreement of the WTO. Subsequently, Pakistan filed an application with the WTO after which it was accepted as an observer of the government procurement group. This is the first step towards availing of this facility which was achieved with the help of the US Department of Commerce. Now we enjoy some rights as an observer which is a positive development. We have been given rights to bid in US governments procurement. We will educate Pakistani companies on this so that they can participate in US government procurement contracts, he added. The commerce minister  that there is a vast opportunity for Pakistani companies to supply materials such as textile and shoes to the US. Pakistans Economic Minister to Washington told media persons that Pakistan cannot participate in regular procurement of the US but the US President has the power to give a waiver in any particular case. The commerce minister explained that working level discussions were held with the US officials on Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). He added that the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with the US will be signed only when it is deemed beneficial for Pakistan. He further maintained that Pakistan has gone through the standard template of the US on BIT, adding that if Pakistan implements the US template it will have several obligations. The Commerce Minister  that Pakistan is preparing its own template which will be shared with the US once it is readied. Replying to a question, the Commerce Minister  that Pakistan is in GSP with the US for the last 35  but never filed a petition but the present government is going to file a petition. Commerce Secretary Shahzad Arbab confirmed that Tauqeer Shah former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Punjab and an accused in the Model Town tragedy has been granted visa and is leaving for Geneva as ambassador to the WTO in a couple of days, as permanent representative to the WTO. In response to a volley of questions on the appointment of Dr Tauqeer Shah to represent Pakistan at WTO, the Commerce Minister defended the appointment saying that selection process was transparent. The Commerce Minister revealed that an approval from the WTO on his appointment has been received. Replying to a question, the Commerce Minister  Pakistan does not foresee any major change in trade trends with the US. The US has its own sensitivities on textile sector and keeping in mind that scenario Pakistan will file its petition of new items after GSP, as reauthorized by the Congress after remaining pending for the last 19 months. Pakistan is in the GSP for the last 35  but it never filed any petition. However, the incumbent government is going to file a petition as GSP is approved by the Congress. There are some textile items which have sensitivity. Presently, there is a flat line in Pakistans imports and exports. Thats why we are trying to find new avenues in trade towards value addition, he added. According to the Minister, as Pakistan is shifting to value addition in textile, footwear etc it will have a positive impact on Pakistans exports to the US. Pakistan is watching the movement of international market. Commerce Ministry has no control on currency but when it is affected, Pakistans exports face negative implications. The commerce minister  Pakistan has not sought investment on its own cost under the BIT. Pakistan wants to integrate itself with international market. In reply to a question, he , the Commerce Ministry is initiating a process for appointment of new trade officers for different countries, adding that utmost efforts will be made to select trade officers on merit. This time the focus will be on people who have ample market aptitude. The commerce minister further stated that some of the concerns raised in the US Pakistan Business Opportunities Conference deserve consideration, but some others were not justified. In reply to a question, he  that a dispute on Export Development Fund (EDF) with Textile Ministry has been resolved, adding that the fund is for export development and not for export reward. panies to excel in the sectors where they are strong.',\n",
       " 'EUs new GMO law leaves questions unanswered Euobserver, By HYPERLINK \"https://euobserver.com/search?q=Eric+Maurice\"Eric Maurice BRUSSELS, 12. Mar, 17:35 A new directive on cultivation of geneticallymodified crops (GMOs) in Europe breaks an old deadlock between the European Commission, member states, and producers. But it leaves open political and legal questions. Under the proposal, EU member states will be able to ban or restrict cultivation of GMOs on their territory, but they will not be able to block the authorisation process at EUlevel. The new rules give member states a twostep possibility for refusing GMO cultivation. First, during the EU authorisation process, they will be able to ajust the geographical scope of the cultivation. Second, if a crop is authorised by the commission, they will be able to restrict or prohibit cultivation on their territory. The directive gives member states the possibility to ban GMO cultivation on environmental grounds, but also for other reasons, such as socioeconomic impact or public policy. They will no longer need to provide new evidence of risk to health or the environment. The directive, which was approved on 2 March, rubberstamps a compromise voted by the European Parliament in January. It was signed into law on Wednesday (11 March) and should be effective in April or May. It is a positive step in aligning the legislation with citizens expectations while respecting the rights of all parties,  health commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis. The new rules give member states the freedom of choice,  Janis Duklavs, the minister of agriculture of Latvia, the country currently holding the EU presidency. But NGOs and GMO critics are sceptical about the new law, saying member states opposed to GM crops still dont have all the guarantees they need. This is no carte blanche for the European Commission to push through new GM crops at the EU level, wrote Mute Schimpf, from Friends of the Earth Europe, in an email to this website. [But] one major weakness is that it is uncertain whether countries would be able to ban crops due to negative environmental impacts at the regional level. Existing EU policy only assesses potential environmental harm at the level of the EU bloc. She also criticised the notion that sovereign states, acting in their role as risk managers, should ask permission from companies which profit from GM cultivation before restricting the cultivation of GM crops in their territory. For Green MEP and antiGMO activist Jose Bove, the new directive is simply bad legislation. Instead of EU legislation, we have multifaceted legislation between states. That can have two consequences: it weakens expertise and it is a legal danger, Bove told this website. He pointed at the possibility that GMOrefusing states could be sued by other states at the World Trade Organisation for distortion of competition, or sued by companies in an investorstate dispute mechanism that is likely to be introduced in a future freetrade agreement with the US. 1507 maize Meanwhile, the first crop to be authorised according to the new rules should be Pioneers 1507 maize. In September 2013, the commission was told by the European Court of Justice not to further delay a decision whether to authorise the product. The ruling came after legal action by Dupont Pioneer, the company that makes it. In February 2014, a large majority of member states voted against giving it a green light, but failed to definitively block the EUlevel decision. Maize 1507 should [now] be approved for cultivation without further delay,  DuPont Pioneer in a statement. We submitted the cultivation application of our 1507 GM maize product 14  ago. 1507 meets all EU regulatory requirements, has received seven positive safety opinions published by Efsa [the EUs food safety agency]. So far, only one crop has been authorized for cultivation in Europe, maize MON810, made by another American company, Monsanto. No rush Now the legislative deadlock has been broken, the EU commission  it will not rush to take a decision on maize 1507 or the eight other pending requests, which are still in the early stages of the approval process. An EU official told this website it will first wait for the review of the decisionmaking process that commission president JeanClaude Juncker  would be published six months after the beginning of the EU executives mandate. The report by Vytenis Andriukaitis is expected in April or May, just when the new directive on cultivation will come into force. The issue is not to run but to find a sustainable solution,  the official, who did not say if the new directive could be compromised by the review. Whereas the commission and Efsa have often been criticised for being too favorable of GMOs, Juncker is considered by some as more suspicious of genetically modified organisms. The official insisted that the commission will take into account the position of member states, but observed that there is some pressure from the agriculture sector and that the commission wants to avoid the risk of going to court again. Science and politics The review should be an opportunity to straighten expertise,  Jose Bove. The only expertise we have is done by Efsa on specific scientific aspects, he . There is no environmental, socioeconomic, agronomical aspects. We need a wider expertise, he added, contesting the commissions view that science and politics are two separate sides of the issue.',\n",
       " 'Chinese currency trade settlement gains popularity in Gulf region By Gerard alfil, Xinhuas China Economic Information Service 13 mars 2015 00:46, DUBAI, Mar. 12 (Xinhua) With Chinese currency the yuan, also known as the renminbi, enjoying rising acceptance, banks and enterprises in the Gulf Arab region are seeking ways to catalyze the growing demand for conducting trade with the currency. By the end of 2014, the yuan has become the worlds seventh largest payment currency and the ninth largest trading currency, Tian Jun, general manager of Abu Dhabi branch of Bank of China,  at a oneday seminar on Thursday. The yuan gradually becomes a new choice for some countries in reserve diversification,  the banker. Chinas yuan, once an almost unknown currency in the daily economic life in the Gulf Arab region, is enjoying rising acceptance across the area. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the biggest export market for Chinese goods in the region, and the leading local and foreign banks in the oilrich Gulf state, such as Dubais Emirates NBD and British lender HSBC, have recently started to expand their product portfolio to provide accounts or trade financing in the Chinese currency. Tian quoted a global clients survey as saying that over 50 percent of the interviewees believe the crossborder renminbi settlement will account for 20 to 30 percent in the next five , and 61 percent intend to use the renminbi in crossborder trade or increase the proportion of renminbi settlement. Kawal Singh Kohli, manager and board member at Dina Investment in Dubai,  his company plans to use the renminbi accounts within the next three months. We bring exporters in the UAE and importers in China together and organize trade financing. We also use bank services from Chinese banks in Dubai to conduct trade between the UAE firms and their trade partners in other countries in the region, the manager . Vincent Cheung, head of the global market trading division at Bank of China in Hong Kong,  the renminbi also receives tailwinds from Chinas domestic economy such as the launch of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in July 2014. Cheung  the Belt and Road Initiatives, Chinas ambitious transEurasia and acrossocean trade strategy, launched last , will also push the internationalization of the global renminbi trade. He also noted that there was a significant development in market liquidity illustrated by a notable spread compression in the exchange rates between the renminbi and other currencies. The liquidity is comparable to euro to U.S. dollar or Australian dollar to U.S. dollar. The average daily volume of interbank foreign exchange and money market transactions in offshore renminbi transaction equals 35 billion U.S. dollars, which is one of the most active currencies traded in Asian trading hours, Cheung . Nasser Saidi, former chief economist of the Dubai International Financial Center, also painted a bright future for the renminbi in an early exclusive interview with Xinhua. The growing internationalization of the renminbi, supported by bilateral currencyswap agreements and the recently announced BRICS development bank and contingency fund, is bound to be the forerunner of a new multicurrency world, thereby breaking the hegemony of the U.S. dollar and accentuating the dominance of China in the global landscape, he . Saidi  there will be a shift in soft power which will start in three main financial developments in the coming decade. A change in the governance of the international monetary and financial architecture, the growth of renminbisation and the emergence of Chinese capital markets to rival London and New York to serve the emerging economies. In 2013, the global payment transaction services institution SWIFT reported the renminbi would overtake the euro to become the second mostused currency in global trade finance,  Cheung. The big four Chinese bank leaders, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank, have opened branch offices in the Dubai banking freezone DIFC since 2008. In November 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of Chinas branches in Doha and Qatar became the first renminbi clearing bank in the Gulf Arab region and the Middle East. Several global financial centers, such as Hong Kong, London and Frankfurt, have also established renminbi offshore trading centers in recent . _____',\n",

Experts say that it would also give India more head room for bilateral negotiations. One major proposal that is likely to get a thrust is the ongoing EUIndia Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) negotiations. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" European Union (EU) has been demanding market access in the insurance and banking sectors along with retail, legal and accountancy. However, not much breakthrough was achieved since the last round of talks, which started in June 2007, was held in May 2013. Apart from these two sectors, the talks have been stalled owing to the 28nation blocs concerns about high tariffs on cars and wines, issues related to geographical indication, and public procurement while Indias concerns on services.

       " 'Why Obama key trade deal with Asia would actually be good for American workers ; China may not join the the TransPacific Partnership trade agreement, but the U.S. still stands to win Washington Post.com By David Autor;David Dorn;Gordon H. Hanson, 13 March 2015 Opponents of giving President Obama fasttrack authority to negotiate the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) the pending trade pact between the United States and 11 countries in Asia and the Americas cite the jobkilling impacts of globalization as a prime reason for their objection. The freetrade agreement would lower tariffs and remove other barriers to imports from member countries, which opponents fear would create steep competition for U.S. industries domestically. There is indeed substantial evidence that import competition from lowwage countries has contributed to the momentous decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in the last two decades. We even researched and published some of that empirical evidence. Still, we believe blocking the TPP on fears of globalization would be a mistake. There are several reasons to support the TPP despite globalization concerns. First, the TPP which seeks to govern exchange of not only traditional goods and services, but also intellectual property and foreign investment would promote trade in knowledgeintensive services in which U.S. companies exert a strong comparative advantage. Second, killing the TPP would do little to bring factory work back to America. Third, and perhaps most , although China is not part of the TPP, enacting the agreement would raise regulatory rules and standards for several of China key trading partners. That would pressure China to meet some of those standards and cease its attempts to game global trade to impede foreign multinational companies. Since 2000, America has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs. Regions that specialized in apparel, footwear, furniture, home electronics, toys and sports equipment industries in which China achieved explosive growth have seen factories close and wages for local workers flatten. Our research indicates that rising import competition from China accounted for 21 percent of the overall decline in U.S. employment in manufacturing industries during the 1990s and 2000s. The wave of automation that replaced middleclass jobs available to workers without a college education added to those losses. We sympathize with the regions and families that suffered, but halting TPP would not assist U.S. manufacturing or benefit U.S. workers. The reality is that the globalization of manufacturing is a fait accompli. Those manufacturing jobs are not coming back. Further, the TPP lower trade barriers would barely affect import competition faced by U.S. manufacturers. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Trade Organization counts 160 members, including every major economy and most ly China, which joined in 2001. According to the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Bank, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" WTO members can export manufacturing goods to the U.S. market at an average tariff of just 2 percent. Within the proposed TPP, the United States already has bilateral trade deals that have eliminated all manufacturing tariffs with five of the 11 members: Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore. Cutting already rockbottom U.S. manufacturing tariffs to zero for the remaining TPP countries would thus have negligible effects on U.S. producers. These countries already enjoy largely unfettered access to U.S. markets. The results of existing economic analyses on the responsiveness of global trade to manufacturing tariffs suggest that the consequences of the TPP for U.S. manufacturing employment likely would be slight. But if the TPP has little downside for the U.S., what the upside? Why bother with the deal at all? The reason is that the TPP is about much more than manufacturing. Most notably, it promises to liberalize trade in services and in agriculture, sectors in which the United States runs large trade surpluses, but which the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Trade Organization, despite 20  of trying, has failed to pry open internationally. Successfully exporting information and computer services, where the U.S. maintains substantial technological leadership, requires more than low tariffs. It also requires protecting patents against infringement and safeguarding business assets and revenues against expropriation by foreign governments. To the extent that Obama succeeds in enshrining these guarantees in the TPP, the agreement would give a substantial boost to U.S. trade. Americans have to take advantage of a new reality: Today, U.S. companies rely on global production networks for their success. When a trading partner exports a product to the U.S., the domestic economy gains because the U.S. often has exported the parts, components, or ideas for that product to that country. China manufacturing growth, for instance, would have been inconceivable without its import of U.S. technology from multinational companies, which generates income for the domestic economy and gainful employment for engineers, programmers and other skilled occupations. The phenomenal sales of the iPhone 6, which Apple designs in California, rests on the capability of Foxconn plants in China to assemble handsets at reasonable cost. Rising Chinese consumer affluence also generates a virtuous circle for U.S. firms. China is poised to surpass the U.S. as the largest consumer market for the iPhone. Apple experience is unusual, but not unparalleled. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that 24 percent of U.S. service exports are now accounted for by telecommunications, information technology, and royalties from licensing intellectual property. For the U.S. to derive maximum benefit from its advances in technologyintensive products, such as smartphones, U.S. companies need strong global protection of intellectual property. The TPP seeks to harmonize such protections across member countries. If passed, the TPP also would create a powerful template for future trade deals, including with China, which would move the U.S. closer to resolving conflicts the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" WTO has been unable to handle. Consider, for example, the case of HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Qualcomm, a highly successful San Diegobased maker of chipsets for wireless communications that earns half of its global revenues in China. The company substantial share of the Chinese chip market attracted the attention of the Chinese government, which proceeded to extract $1 billion in fines for alleged anticompetitive practices. In the U.S., where HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Qualcomm also sells its chipsets, the company has faced no such antitrust penalties. Under current trade law, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Qualcomm has little recourse to appeal its treatment by the Chinese government. Under a trade agreement with China like the TPP, however, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Qualcomm and other U.S. companies would have access to an investorstate dispute settlement mechanism. Contrary to criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (DMass.), this mechanism would protect U.S. firms against predatory regulatory interventions by member governments. Anticompetitive asymmetries in the world trade system disproportionately harm U.S. firms at present. Enactment of the TPP would establish protections against these asymmetries for U.S. companies. Expanding global trade has remade manufacturing, forcing workers, businesses, and entire regions to endure often painful adjustments. However, much as we might like to return to 1970 when manufacturing comprised a quarter of U.S. nonfarm employment, that impossible without massive protectionist barriers that would isolate the U.S. economy and lower U.S. living standards. Blocking the TPP because of justified unhappiness over manufacturing lost glory would amount to refighting the last trade war beggaring the future as retribution for the past. A responsible trade agenda should instead seek to provide the supporting policy structure protections for intellectual property and freedom from confiscatory regulations that allows U.S. companies to excel in the sectors where they are strong.',\n",

The five partner states are expected to ratify the WTO protocol before March 31 in order to show their commitment to the trade pact they recently signed with the US. It is expected that once the protocol is implemented, it will help reduce the cost of doing business between the EAC and other economies by almost 14.5 per cent, adding to trade reforms already underway in the region. READ: Africa to present unified stand on issues at WTO meeting in Kenya James Kiiru, an external trade officer at HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Kenyas Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,  final preparations are underway to ratify the protocol not only because of the deadline but also because Kenya will be hosting the WTO summit towards the end of the . A wellfunctioning trade facilitation regime will allow easier and faster flow of goods across borders. The EAC will be viewed as progressive and ready to attract investments and also promote intraregional trade,  Mr Kiiru. In the new deal, recently signed in the US, the two parties agreed to adopt the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement signed in Bali in 2013, which commits countries to ensure that trade issues, including Customs, documentation procedures along their transport corridors and ports are completely abolished to reduce the cost of doing business. The US has committed to supporting the member states to implement the WTO agreement and to team up with other governments and the private sector on trade issues,  Mr Kiiru. In November last , WTO members adopted a protocol to add the Trade Facilitation Agreement to the WTO deal opening the process up for individual WTO members to formally accept the agreement. So far, only China, Korea, Russia, Mauritius and the US have ratified the protocol. The WTO agreement will enter into force only when twothirds of WTOs members have completed their domestic legal procedures and submitted their instruments of acceptance. The focus of the USEAC trade agreement is on trade and investment,  Mr Kiiru, adding that US companies like HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" IBM, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Fedex and DHL are keen on investing in the region while the ones already here plan to expand. In the agreement, the US will provide access to its markets for East Africas agricultural produce and in return the region will cut tariffs on imported manufactured goods from the West. Currently, the EAC products access quotafree markets in the US through the the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which is expected to be renewed after the September expiry for another 15 . We are however not utilising this opportunity as the region is only able to export up to five products to the US,  Mr Kiiru, adding, The challenge the partner states have is on poor product standards, which hinder them from selling more products in the US. The two parties will work together to develop and advance trade facilitation initiatives on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures to meet international standards and guidelines. No later than 18 months after the coming into force of this agreement, each EAC partner state shall establish an effective process to ensure that it notifies all proposed SPS measures to WTO, read the EACUS trade agreement. The main exports from East Africa to the US are agricultural goods and textiles, while US exports have so far consisted of heavy machinery and aircraft. Jane Ngige, the CEO of the Kenya Flower Council,  the main challenge for horticultural products in accessing the US market is lack of direct flights. We currently have no direct flights and as a result of routing through Holland it takes longer for our fresh produce to get to the US market,  Ms Ngige, adding that the EAC partners need to also negotiate for direct flights. Andrew Luzze, executive director of the East African Business Council (EABC),  that by adopting the WTO trade agreement, the region will build on the reforms being pursued by the partner states, which have resulted in substantial reductions in the time and cost of moving goods across borders within the EAC. The US has had bilateral partnerships with individual EAC states since 2013 but this agreement marks the first of its kind with the regional trading bloc,  US trade representative Michael Froman. Trade between the US and the EAC countries in 2014 increased by 52 per cent to $2.7 billion. Imports from the US totalled $2 billion; Exports totalled $743 million. According to Eric Musau, a business analyst at Stanbic Investment Bank, the US wants to maintain its presence in Africa since China, India, and the EU have all increased their economic links and trade deals with African countries over the past decade. This will not have much impact on economic development in the region but will help with capacity building on the areas of transport and trade facilitation,  Mr Musau.',\n",
       " 'Activating NTM desks in South Asia for more trade Asjadul Kibria 15 March 2015 The Financial Express (Bangladesh) Bangladesh, March 15 The problems of nontariff barriers (NTBs) and nontariff measures (NTMs) in trading within South Asia are not new. Thus the effort to address the problems needs to be a continuous process as a part of smooth trade facilitation across the region. But identifying NTBs and NTMs is always a challenging task due to complexity of their nature. Without rightly identifying any NTB or NTM, it is not possible to take appropriate remedial steps. Against such a backdrop, the SAARC Trade Promotion Network (TPN) has come up with an initiative to establish a \\'NTM Desk\\' in leading trade bodies of all the SAARC countries two  ago. The initiative has followed a recommendation of a study titled \\'NTMs in South Asia: Assessment and Analysis\\' carried out by three trade experts of Bangladesh with the support of Dhakabased Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI). The SAARC TPN is a regional platform consisting of 28 public and private institutions from the eight membercountries of the regional bloc. While public sector members are national commerce or trade ministers or departments or promotion agencies, private sector members are leading trade bodies of the memberstates. So, the platform is a kind of privatepublic partnership. The core idea of NTM desks is to set a mechanism for regular monitoring and reporting nontariff measures being faced by respective countries in regional trade and to exchange information among them. Through this process, all the desks across the eight countries would be able to identify NTMs and also recommend ways to remove those. As trade bodies have a lot of functions, a dedicated desk for NTMs is more helpful for reducing or removing the problem. On a pilot basis, three NTM desks were established in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. In Bangladesh, the MCCI set up the desk in early 2014. In December 2013, similar desks were established in the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and later in the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI). Following the pilot initiative, all the membercountries have established such desks in their leading trade bodies. In Bangladesh, besides the MCCI, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) has also established a NTM desk. NTBS AND NTMS: There is a difference between NTBs and NTMs although it is not always easy to differentiate between the two. One NTM may be a NTB for a particular country, but not for the other although NTBs are recognised as a subset of NTMs. The SAARC membercountries are also divided in many cases over identification of NTMs. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" UNCTAD) has set a definition of NTMs which has now been accepted by HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" the International Trade Centre (ITC) and other international bodies. The definition identifies all the policy measures except customs tariffs as NTMs if those have adverse effects on international trade. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" WTO) has allowed the use of NTMs under certain circumstances. For instance, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and PhytoSanitary Measures (SPS) are two recognised NTMs permissible under certain conditions. For example, the India Plant Quarantine Order, 2003 (revised, 2011) regulates plant and plant products in India. Through this Order, the India authority wants to ensure that products imported for human consumption are free from pests and diseases and not harmful for India food security. Thus, implementation of regulations has forced the exporters to maintain strict standards. These standards have posed barriers for some exporting countries. African exporters have already alleged that they are facing huge difficulties on getting their certificates after complying with India requirements. Thus, their exports to India have faced obstacles. But, it is also very difficult to term India strict regulation as a trade barrier as no sensible country will allow low quality and infected food or plant items. According to the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" ITC, NTMs are sometimes used \\'as a means to circumvent free trade rules and favour domestic industries at the expense of foreign competition.\\' In such a case, they are known as NTBs. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" ITC, however, acknowledges that it is \\'very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish legitimate NTMs from protectionist NTMs, especially as the same measure may be used for several reasons.\" In case of export of food or beverage items to India, there are some lab testing and packaging requirements needed to be complied with. For example, dates of manufacturing and expiry have to be clearly mentioned on packets. This is an essential requirement for any kind of consumable item. But requirement of labelling the information on top or backside of packages some time appears as a NTB. A Bangladeshi beverage company has faced such type of NTB. India customs officials in land custom stations some time blocked consignments of beverage on the plea that manufacturing and expiry dates were not tagged in the upper portion of the packages. Again, they some time asked for tagging such dates on lower or back portion of the packages. Such a change in labelling requirement is clearly a NTB. Again, there is a requirement that imported jute hessian bags, generally used for transporting items like sugar and fertilisers, need to be labelled with the words \\'Made in (name of the country)\\' in significantly large fonts. As Bangladesh is the only country exporting these bags to India, it has to comply with this requirement. It is a NTM, not a NTB. NEW WING OF COOPERATION: Despite slow implementation of SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area) agreement, countries of the South Asia have to gradually eliminate their customs tariffs for other regional trading partners. Already India has allowed tarifffree market access to all the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) of the SAARC including Bangladesh. Elimination of tariff wall will definitely drive the countries to adopt NTMs for a certain period of time in the name of protecting local industries and restricting lowquality imports from other countries. The Consumer Unity and Trusts Society (CUTS), a Jaipurbased international research organisation, in a study three  back , \"NTMs including customs procedures and other procedural nontariff measures account for more than 80 per cent of cost of doing trade. In South Asia, if nontariff measures affecting the cost of doing trade are addressed properly, then gains to consumers from an enhanced intraregional trade regime would be much than static gains. Further gains can be achieved from gradual liberalisation of intraregional trade in services and investment.\" In this connection, NTM desks in SAARC countries need to work hard to clearly identify NTMs and NTBs. Exchange of information will also be helpful to narrow the differences over defining of NTMs and NTBs among the membercountries. Ultimately, it will help enhance regional trade which is still low compared to other regional trade blocks. Intraregional trade ratio in SAARC has actually declined to 4.63 per cent in 2013 from 5.84 per cent in 2005. At the same time, intraregional trade ratio in BIMSTEC is almost static at 5.3 per cent during the period under review. The CUTS also mentioned \\'a minimum consumer welfare gain of approximately US$2 billion a  by way of savings on aggregate consumer expenditure on imported products in selected categories.\\' The number is not small at all when intraregional trade stood at $44.93 billion in 2013. Thus, a small step like NTM desk can be a new wing of cooperation among the SAARC countries. Addressing NTBs and NTMs will reduce cost of trade across the region. Ultimately, consumers will be benefited.',\n",

       " 'Political stability to drive investment in Oman 14 March 2015 Times of Oman Muscat: In a bid to attract local and foreign investments, Oman has devised various measures to improve the investment climate in the Sultanate. The government commitment to providing infrastructure such as Sohar Industrial Port, industrial estates, freezones besides free transfer of commodities, services and capitals are some encouraging factors for potential investors. Oman joining many international organisations including HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" WTO) and free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States and amendments made to some laws in the country to meet the requirements of globalisation and integration in world economy are some of the other factors which make the country an attractive hub for investments. Banks operating in Oman also provide loans at low interest rates for different industrial projects and guarantees for exports. The government also provides planned industrial land plots that are provided with the required infrastructure to meet the needs of the industrial projects. International rating agencies have pointed out that political stability is one of attractive features in the Sultanate. They noted that political stability encourages a large number of foreign companies to invest in the different economic, production, service and business sectors. As part of the exportbased diversification plan, the Sultanate sought to ensure maximum utilisation of its resources, such as natural gas and to increase the benefit of these resources. To this end, the government intensified its promotion efforts, which resulted in signing of agreements to set up major industries with foreign capitals, such as fertiliser project in Sur, steel and iron factory, aluminum smelter and other projects. The government encourages foreign capital to invest in the untapped resources in the Sultanate, impart technology, benefit from the administrative capabilities and benefit from communication with multinational companies by opening new markets for Omani products. The country has been committed to opening the economic market as per the free competition rule. To this end, it has encouraged the private sector and provided it with facilities that help it play an active role in the growth of gross domestic product (GDP). It also provided a number of packages, incentives, guarantees, tax exemptions and simplified procedures. It promoted transparent management of investments. The Sultanate, which adopts ambitious privatisation policy, has integrated infrastructure and advanced communication and banking networks. It also implements policies that are investorfriendly in a bid to attract foreign investments. Oman has a wellregularised capital market that is provided with the latest systems and equipment. It also entered into agreements with some countries to encourage and protect investments. The Sultanate has also a stable monetary system that allows free exchange and transfer of capitals. A survey study conducted by the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI), in coordination with the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Central Bank of Oman (HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" CBO) on the foreign investment in the Sultanate during the seventh five plan (20072011), highlighted the remarkable growth in the foreign direct and indirect investments. As of the end of 2013, the value of foreign investments in the Sultanate stood at OMR12.7 billion. Foreign reports point out that the Sultanate has integrated package of incentives for foreign investments, the most  of which are the social and political stability, availability of production factors, such as free economic zones and industrial estates equipped with worldclass facilities and the strategic location on the world regional and international trade routes coupled with having many export ports. The Sultanate, which adopts free economy policy, promulgates new laws and legislations and updates its existing laws to ensure proper implementation of the free market policy.

       " 'Global manufacturing: Made in China? 14 March 2015 The Economist Asia dominance in manufacturing will endure. That will make development harder for others BY MAKING things and selling them to foreigners, China has transformed itselfand the world economy with it. In 1990 it produced less than 3% of global manufacturing output by value; its share now is nearly a quarter. China produces about 80% of the world airconditioners, 70% of its mobile phones and 60% of its shoes. The white heat of China ascent has forged supply chains that reach deep into SouthEast Asia. This \"Factory Asia\" now makes almost half the world goods. China has been following in the footsteps of Asian tigers such as South Korea and Taiwan. Many assumed that, in due course, the baton would pass to other parts of the world, enabling them in their turn to manufacture their way to prosperity. But far from being loosened by rising wages, China grip is tightening. Lowcost work that does leave China goes mainly to SouthEast Asia, only reinforcing Factory Asia dominance (see pages 7576). That raises questions for emerging markets outside China orbit. From India to Africa and South America, the tricky task of getting rich has become harder. Work to rule China economy is not as robust as it was. The property market is plagued by excess supply. Rising debt is a burden. Earlier this month the government  that it was aiming for growth of 7% this , which would be its lowest for more than two decadesdata this week suggest even this might be a struggle (see page 66). Despite this, China will continue to have three formidable advantages in manufacturing that will benefit the economy as a whole. First, it is clinging on to lowcost manufacturing, even as it goes upmarket to exploit highervalue activities. Its share of global clothing exports has actually risen, from 42.6% in 2011 to 43.1% in 2013. It is also making more of the things that go into its goods. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" World Bank has found that the share of imported components in China total exports has fallen from a peak of 60% in the mid1990s to around 35% today. This is partly because China boasts clusters of efficient suppliers that others will struggle to replicate. It has excellent, and improving, infrastructure: it plans to build ten airports a  until 2020 (see page 65). And its firms are using automation to raise productivity, offsetting some of the effect of higher wagesthe idea behind the government new \"Made in China 2025\" strategy. China second strength is Factory Asia itself. As wages rise, some lowcost activity is indeed leaving the country. Much of this is passing to large lowincome populations in SouthEast Asia. This process has a dark side. Last  an NGO found that almost 30% of workers in Malaysia electronics industry were forced labour (see page 67). But as HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Samsung, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Microsoft, Toyota and other multinational firms trim production in China and turn instead to places such as Myanmar and the Philippines, they reinforce a regional supply chain with China at the centre. The third advantage is that China is increasingly a linchpin of demand. As the spending and sophistication of Chinese consumers grows, Factory Asia is grabbing a bigger share of highermargin marketing and customer service. At the same time, Chinese demand is strengthening Asian supply chains all the more. When it comes to the Chinese market, local contractors have the edge over distant rivals. Deft policy could boost these advantages still further. The HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is capable of snapping up lowend manufacturing. China shareby volumeof the market for American shoe imports slipped from 87% in 2009 to 79% last . Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia picked up all the extra work. But ASEAN could do far more to create a single market for more complex goods and services. Regionalor, better, globaldeals would smooth the spread of manufacturing networks from China into nearby countries. The example of Thailand strength in vehicle production, which followed the scrapping of restrictions on foreign components, shows how the right policies can weld SouthEast Asian countries into China manufacturing machine. Unfortunately, other parts of the emerging world have less cause to rejoice. They lack a large economy that can act as the nucleus of a regional grouping. The North American FreeTrade Agreement has brought Mexican firms into supply chains that crisscross North America, but not Central and South American ones. High trade barriers mean western Europe will not help north Africa in the way that it has helped central and eastern Europe. And even when places like India or subSaharan Africa prise production from Factory Asia grasp, another problem remains. Manufacturing may no longer offer the employment or income gains that it once did. In the past exportled manufacturing offered a way for large numbers of unskilled workers to move from field to factory, transforming their productivity at a stroke. Now technological advances have led to fewer workers on factory floors. China and its neighbours may have been the last countries to be able to climb up the ladder of development simply by recruiting lots of unskilled people to make things cheaply. Exports still remain the surest path to success for emerging markets. Competing in global markets is the best way to boost productivity. But governments outside the gates of Factory Asia will have to rely on several engines of developmentnot just manufacturing, but agriculture and services, too. India ITservices sector shows what can be achieved, but it is highskilled and barely taps into the country ocean of labour. Put policy to work Such a model of development demands more of policymakers than competing on manufacturing labour costs ever did. A more liberal global regime for trade in services should be a priority for South America and Africa. Infrastructure spending has to focus on fibreoptic cables as well as ports and roads. Education is essential, because countries trying to break into global markets will need skilled workforces. These are tall orders for developing countries. But just waiting for higher Chinese wages to push jobs their way is a recipe for failure.',\n",
       " 'Make in India: Adding Man to Manufacturing 15 March 2015 Business Today The Modi government \"Make in India\" initiative is certainly overdue. Today, a large number of mass produced consumer goods, be it textiles, readymade garments, toys, handbags, luggage items, mobile phones, television sets, air conditioners or shoes, are mainly imported. They are made abroad, usually in China.In the last 15  we have forgotten that everything sold in India in the second part of the last century had to be made in India, and manufacturing was taken for granted. How is it that the tables have turned 180 degrees? A few  after independence we had a foreign exchange crisis and strict import controls were levied. The import of consumer goods was totally banned. In fact, in the 1960s and 1970s, even raw material was not allowed to be imported freely. Import licences had to be obtained and products like plastic raw material had an import duty of over 200 per cent.With the economic reforms in the early 1990s, imports became quite liberal, but only as recently as 2001, when under the rules of the HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" WTO agreement consumer goods were allowed to be imported. At the beginning of the century, we could import completely finished consumer goods for the first time after nearly 50 . At first, the import duty on such goods was 80 per cent but since about 2007, the peak rate of import duty is only 10 per cent with a few exceptions, notably automobiles, where imports have been made quite prohibitive. Earlier, we also had a regime where a lot of consumer products were allowed to be made only by the small scale sector. This resulted in inefficient manufacturing, and thrived to some extent on tax evasion. There was a disincentive to grow and achieve economies of scale.Meanwhile, countries like China had developed an extremely efficient, and lowcost manufacturing environment. China has become virtually the factory for the world for not only lowwage, labourintensive products, but also gradually the entire gamut of consumer products like televisions, mobiles, other electronic products and industrial machinery, moulds and dyes, etc.In India we have everything that China has: a huge young population which is largely uneducated, unskilled and unemployed. We also have a large manufacturing base and an entrepreneurial business culture. However, our labour policies offer such iron clad job security to the workers that it is virtually impossible to close down a factory employing more than 100 workmen under any circumstances. The only way such a factory closes down is if the company goes bankrupt. The consequence of such a labour policy is that the workers have no vested interest in the longterm success of the company, and there is a constant demand for increased wages.There are frequent disputes and disruptions and there is no emphasis on productivity. Highly productive and efficient units have become more the exception than the norm and in a free trade world regime, India factories cannot compete against other countries particularly China. As a result, with imports becoming so easy and so wellpriced, manufacturing of such goods in India has become fairly unviable. The irony is that largescale employment will come only from lowcost consumer goods.China has created a large manufacturing base by providing an entire ecosystem conducive to lowcost and high quality products. This results in a virtuous cycle, leading to further economies of scale. Countries like India find it difficult to compete with them.A lot of economists and political leaders make a defensive argument that India has become a service sectorintensive country, and we can also have knowledgeintensive industries like the IT sector. However, as long as we have largescale unemployment, we have to explore all avenues of the economy, and it is imperative that we promote that sector of industry which has the maximum potential for employment, namely manufacturing.(Dilip Piramal is Chairman, HYPERLINK \"https://mailcasht.cwr.wto.org/owa/UrlBlockedError.aspx\" VIP Industries) ________________________________',\n",

It is the E.U. claim over customs duties for palm oil, paper and refrigerators in the first place. It may also possible be the suit over LCVs, Ulyukayev pointed out. On March 9, Russia turned down the E.U. request to convene a panel of arbiters of the WTO to investigate the dispute over duties on imports of paper, cardboard, palm oil and fridges. The WTO will consider an E.U. request to establish a panel of arbiters to settle the dispute at a meeting on March 25, and Russia will not be able to turn down the panel for a second time. End',\n",

       " 'Indonesia complains over US duties imposed on coated paper 16 March 2015 The Jakarta Post Indonesia has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it says its coated paper shipped to the US has become a target of punitive duties at the hands of the US authorities. The US has imposed a 20.13 percent antidumping tariff and a 17.94 percent countervailing tariff on Indonesia coated paper, which is normally used for highquality print graphics. The duties, imposed since 2010, will this  be assessed to determine if they will be extended. Indonesia stated the measures violated the WTO rules, including AntiDumping Agreement and the Subsidies and Countervailing (SCM) Agreement, according to a statement issued by the WTO on Friday. Indonesia move was motivated, among others, by its allegation that the benchmark for pricing used by the US to determine the duties was based on prices in another country,  Trade Ministry trade defense director Oke Nurwan. \"We are adopting a precedent set by China, which has won an appeal in one of its trade disputes, as the reference for pricing in the case inquiry was based on prices in other countries,\" he told The Jakarta Post Sunday. Similar coated paper from China was also charged with antidumping and countervailing duties by the US authorities. In May 2012, China took the case to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and later appealed to the Appellate Body following an unfavorable result. The levies imposed on Indonesia coated paper have impacted major producers PT Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimia, PT Pindo Deli Pulp and Paper Mills and PT Indah Kiat Pulp and Paper, grouped under pulp and paper giant Asia Pulp and Paper. The duties imposed have effectively lowered the shipment of glossy paper, which is generally employed in printing multicolored graphics for catalogues, books, magazines, envelopes, labels, wrapping paper and greeting cards, from US$69.6 million before 2010 to $16.7 million at present, according to data from the Trade Ministry. Oke further  he expected the US would immediately respond to Indonesia request for consultations to settle the issue. The US must address the request within 60 days and if consultations fail to settle concerns, Indonesia can progress the case into a formal trade dispute. The Indonesian pulp and paper industry has dealt with repeated dumping and subsidy allegations, including from the US, due to its efficient production that allows competitive prices. Earlier this , based on petitions from its domestic stakeholders United Steelworkers (USW) and four paper manufacturers the US suspected that Indonesia, along with Australia, Brazil, China and Portugal, had dumped photocopy paper on the country. In addition, it also claimed that paper makers in Indonesia and China had received improper subsidies. Indonesia has consulted the US on the issue, but the follow up has not been forthcoming. Asia Pulp and Paper director Suhendra Wiriadinata did not respond to the Post request for comment. JP/Linda Yulisman',\n",
       " 'East African Partner states to implement WTO trade deal CHRISTABEL LIGAMI 14 March 2015 The East African partner states have taken the final step towards implementing the World Trade Organisation Trade Facilitation Agreement, which is expected to widen the market for the regions goods and services. The five partner states are expected to ratify the WTO protocol before March 31 in order to show their commitment to the trade pact they recently signed with the US. It is expected that once the protocol is implemented, it will help reduce the cost of doing business between the EAC and other economies by almost 14.5 per cent, adding to trade reforms already underway in the region. READ: Africa to present unified stand on issues at WTO meeting in Kenya James Kiiru, an external trade officer at Kenyas Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,  final preparations are underway to ratify the protocol not only because of the deadline but also because Kenya will be hosting the WTO summit towards the end of the . A wellfunctioning trade facilitation regime will allow easier and faster flow of goods across borders. The EAC will be viewed as progressive and ready to attract investments and also promote intraregional trade,  Mr Kiiru. In the new deal, recently signed in the US, the two parties agreed to adopt the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement signed in Bali in 2013, which commits countries to ensure that trade issues, including Customs, documentation procedures along their transport corridors and ports are completely abolished to reduce the cost of doing business. The US has committed to supporting the member states to implement the WTO agreement and to team up with other governments and the private sector on trade issues,  Mr Kiiru. In November last , WTO members adopted a protocol to add the Trade Facilitation Agreement to the WTO deal opening the process up for individual WTO members to formally accept the agreement. So far, only China, Korea, Russia, Mauritius and the US have ratified the protocol. The WTO agreement will enter into force only when twothirds of WTOs members have completed their domestic legal procedures and submitted their instruments of acceptance. The focus of the USEAC trade agreement is on trade and investment,  Mr Kiiru, adding that US companies like IBM, Fedex and DHL are keen on investing in the region while the ones already here plan to expand. In the agreement, the US will provide access to its markets for East Africas agricultural produce and in return the region will cut tariffs on imported manufactured goods from the West. Currently, the EAC products access quotafree markets in the US through the the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which is expected to be renewed after the September expiry for another 15 . We are however not utilising this opportunity as the region is only able to export up to five products to the US,  Mr Kiiru, adding, The challenge the partner states have is on poor product standards, which hinder them from selling more products in the US. The two parties will work together to develop and advance trade facilitation initiatives on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures to meet international standards and guidelines. No later than 18 months after the coming into force of this agreement, each EAC partner state shall establish an effective process to ensure that it notifies all proposed SPS measures to WTO, read the EACUS trade agreement. The main exports from East Africa to the US are agricultural goods and textiles, while US exports have so far consisted of heavy machinery and aircraft. Jane Ngige, the CEO of the Kenya Flower Council,  the main challenge for horticultural products in accessing the US market is lack of direct flights. We currently have no direct flights and as a result of routing through Holland it takes longer for our fresh produce to get to the US market,  Ms Ngige, adding that the EAC partners need to also negotiate for direct flights. Andrew Luzze, executive director of the East African Business Council (EABC),  that by adopting the WTO trade agreement, the region will build on the reforms being pursued by the partner states, which have resulted in substantial reductions in the time and cost of moving goods across borders within the EAC. The US has had bilateral partnerships with individual EAC states since 2013 but this agreement marks the first of its kind with the regional trading bloc,  US trade representative Michael Froman. Trade between the US and the EAC countries in 2014 increased by 52 per cent to $2.7 billion. Imports from the US totalled $2 billion; Exports totalled $743 million. According to Eric Musau, a business analyst at Stanbic Investment Bank, the US wants to maintain its presence in Africa since China, India, and the EU have all increased their economic links and trade deals with African countries over the past decade. This will not have much impact on economic development in the region but will help with capacity building on the areas of transport and trade facilitation,  Mr Musau. Nation Media Group Limited',\n",

India was represented by Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh . Agriculture Ministers of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa were also present in the meeting. \"In this joint declaration, public policies for food and nutrition security and the strengthening of family farming are highlighted in detail, the results of which are going to form a key part of the general strategy for ensuring access to food for the most vulnerable populations of BRICS and other developing countries,\" Singh  at the meeting. The joint declaration would certainly play a key role in taking forward our agricultural cooperation, he added. Following an agreement between India and the US, negotiations at the WTO made a headway after it was resolved that the \"peace clause\" would continue till a permanent solution to the public stockholding is found. Under the peace clause, a WTO member gets immunity against penalty for breaching the food subsidy cap. As per the WTO norms, a developing nation can provide food subsidy of up to 10 per cent of the total farm output Expressing concerns over grave distortion caused by agricultural export subsidies on international trade, BRICS nations also resolved to support WTO talks for eliminating the use of this policy instrument by countries as stated in the 2013 WTO ministerial conference declaration adopted in Bali. \"...Multilateral negotiations should prioritise efforts to create a level playing field by substantially improving market access, eliminating export subsidies and significantly reducing the level of trade distorting domestic support,\"  BRICS nations in the joint declaration.

       " \"U.S. Rejects Korea First WTO Panel Request In OCTG AD Dispute World Trade Online Posted: March 16, 2015 The United States has rejected South Korea first request for a dispute settlement panel challenging its antidumping (AD) duties on Korean imports of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) with the argument that the duties are consistent with World Trade Organization rules. Korea made its first request, which WTO members are allowed to block, at the March 10 meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body. The next DSB meeting, at which Korea could make a request is on March 25. It requested the panel on Feb. 23 following formal WTO consultations with the U.S. on Jan. 21. At the DSB meeting, Korea reiterated the details of its Feb. 23 panel request, which centers on Commerce methodology for determining which profit information to use in calculating the fair value of OCTG. However, Korea is also taking issue with other aspects of Commerce July 2014 final determination. After a preliminary finding of no dumping on Korean OCTG that provoked congressional objections, Commerce changed the profit information it used. That led to dumping margins of 9.89 percent and 15.75 percent for the mandatory respondents, with all other Korean companies getting a rate of 12.82 percent. In the panel request, Korea charged that Commerce decision violates Article 2.2.2 (iii) of the WTO AD Agreement. That provision requires that the profit margin used by the investigating authority “shall not exceed the profit normally realized by other exporters or producers on sales of products in the same general category in the domestic market of the country of origin.” Sources critical of Commerce final determination charged that it inappropriately used the profit information of a multinational steel company known as Tenaris to calculate the fair value. Because Tenaris sold OCTGs worldwide, but not in the Korean market, Commerce decision to use its profit information is in violation of Article 2.2.2(iii) according to those critics. The Tenaris profit data were used after Commerce rejected the use of profit information from thirdcountry sales of the mandatory respondents because they did not amount to 5 percent of what those companies sold in the U.S. market. Korea is charging that the way in which Commerce applied this 5 percent threshold, as well as the threshold itself, violates Article 2.2 of the AD Agreement, which spells out how to determine whether dumping is occurring. A privatesector lawyer acknowledged that a successful assuch challenge of Commerce threshold here could have systemic implications for the U.S., but he argued that it is not the same scale as prior decisions on such issues as zeroing and targeted dumping. Korea is also alleging a number of procedural violations occurred during the investigation, many of which relate to Commerce decision to use the Tenaris profit data during the investigation. Korea is also charging that the department incorrectly found that NEXTEEL one of the mandatory respondents was affiliated with its major input supplier and main customer. The U.S. domestic industry had charged that the Korean respondents' affiliations allowed them to hide the true cost of production of OCTG, effectively hiding any dumping that occurred. But this issue had lessened in importance as this affiliation issue was not a significant factor in setting dumping margins on Korean imports. Separately, Indonesia is seeking WTO consultations with the U.S. on the AD and CVD duties it imposed on coated paper, according to a March 13 WTO announcement. Indonesia is alleging that the U.S. is violating several provisions within the AD Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to the announcement.\",\n",
       " 'China Steel Glut Riles U.S., Europe Producers By Biman Mukherji in Hong Kong, John W. Miller in Pittsburgh and ChuinWei Yap in Beijing 17 March 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe China massive steelmaking engine, determined to keep humming as growth cools at home, is flooding the world with exports, spurring steel producers around the globe to seek government protection from falling prices. From the European Union to Korea and India, China excess metal supply is upending trade patterns and heating up turf battles among local steelmakers. In the U.S., the world secondbiggest steel consumer, a fresh wave of layoffs is fueling appeals for tariffs. U.S. steel producers such as U.S. Steel Corp. and Nucor Corp. are starting to seek political support for trade action. China steel exports rose 63% to 9.2 million tons in January from a  earlier, a rise that puts them on pace this  to beat the 82.1 million tons China exported last . That number increased 59% from 2013 and was the most steel ever exported by any country this century. China produces as much steel as the rest of the world combined more than four times the peak U.S. production in the 1970s. But as China growth slows, the excess steel that Chinese industry doesn\\'t need is washing up overseas. Steel use in China grew by just 1% in 2014 and growth will slow further to 0.8% in 2015, according to the World Steel Association, as the country realestate sector cools. China mills have yet to slow in lockstep. Their output is supported by a fall in the price of iron ore, the main ingredient in making steel. Mills\\' refusal to cut back despite slower demand growth is what irks steelmakers elsewhere in the world. The statebacked China Iron and Steel Association has in the past described efforts to roll back Chinese exports as \"protectionist.\" But it has also  that it recognizes the problem and has encouraged Chinese steelmakers to hold down exports. Chief executives of leading American steel producers  Thursday they would testify later this month at a Congressional Steel Caucus hearing, a move that trade lawyers  is a prelude to launching at least one antidumping complaint with the International Trade Commission. \"Dumping,\" or selling abroad below the cost of production to gain market share, is illegal under World Trade Organization law and is punishable with tariffs. Chinese exports to the U.S., which jumped 40% in January from a  earlier, have further depressed prices already hurt by an oildrilling slowdown and the resulting slump in demand for steel pipes and tube. The benchmark \"hotrolled coil\" index has dropped 18% to $492 a ton just since Jan. 1. European steel leaders met with European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom last week to make their case for more tariff protection,  Robrecht Himpe, executive vice president at ArcelorMittal Europe and head of the European steel lobbying group Eurofer. Both the U.S. and the EU already have tariffs in place on a handful of Chinese steel products, but steel companies call them insufficient. They say what they must do to demonstrate damage from Chinese exports is too difficult. \"We have to bleed before we get any relief,\"  Debbie Shon, U.S. Steel vice president for international trade. U.S. Steel last week began laying off 614 workers, in a process that will see some of its tubular plant in Lorain, Ohio, temporarily idled. U.S. Steel has idled six plants since 2014, and this  has laid off or issued layoff warnings to around 3,500 workers. The EU has six investigations that might lead to tariffs, covering various products such as fasteners and steel wire, an EU spokesman . Steel imports to the EU from China were 5 million tons in 2014, up 49% from 2013. In December, Korea Hyundai Steel and Dongkuk Steel filed a proposal for an antidumping duty of 18% to 33% on Chinese steel. Australia AntiDumping Commission is investigating about a dozen cases of alleged dumping of lowpriced steel products from Asian countries, including China. Industry minister Ian Macfarlane  the allegation is that steel mills in other countries have been making minor alterations to steel products or routing them through third countries to circumvent Australia antidumping laws. U.S. steelmakers allege a similar practice, saying that China often ships steel to South Korea for processing before it gets moved to the U.S. In India, where imports of some lowerpriced Chinese steel products have surged by close to 200% on between April 2014 and January 2015, some steelmakers are seeking trade measures including higher duties,  Jayant Acharya, commercial director at JSW Steel. \"There is some trade action definitely required,\"  Mr. Acharya. He  that for certain steel products priced at $550 a ton in October, prices of Chinese imports have fallen by as much as $150 a ton. China producers doubled their exports to India last , to 2.8 million tons, according to an ING Bank report. The global steel industry suffers from overcapacity in part because many countries make it a point of national pride to support a domestic steel industry. Some producers fear the worst is yet to come. Property and infrastructure construction demand in China is likely to remain under pressure following  of breakneck growth and despite a recent interest rate cut, analysts say. That would mean Chinese domestic demand for steel is unlikely to perk up soon. Many Chinese steelmakers are governmentowned or closely linked to local governments,  Jiming Zou, an analyst at Moody Investors Service. Given their  role as employers and providers of tax revenue, the mills are unlikely to close or cut production even if running losses, he . China steelmakers benefit from relatively lowcost labor and inputs such as coking coal. While there has been some tightening of new lending to Chinese industries that face overcapacity, Mr. Zou , major stateowned steel makers continue to have their loans rolled over or refinanced. Analysts pointed to the Chinese currency, as well. \"The weakening renminbi was also a factor in encouraging exports,\"  Xue Heping, an analyst who advises the China Iron and Steel Association. Chinese steelmakers could also get a boost from foreign investors. Steel will be among industries opened to foreign ownership, the country National Development & Reform Commission,  Friday.',\n",
       " 'Amina Asks Japan to Review Rules On Kenya Flowers by Correspondent 16 March 2015 All Africa Tokyo, Mar 16, 2015 (Capital FM/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has urged Japanese authorities to review the fumigation requirements imposed on flower exports from Kenya. Under the present arrangement, flowers exported to Japan are required to be inspected and fumigated at the port of entry. \"This requirement has imposed extra costs on exporters which have eroded their benefits,\" Mohamed  during bilateral talks with Akio Koizumi, VicePresident of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Tokyo. She conveyed the proposal by the Flower Council of Kenya for a review of this requirement to allow for fumigation of flowers in Kenya before exportation. Acknowledging the challenges this requirement has imposed on exporters, Koizumi called for wider consultations between all stakeholders on the way forward. \"We will consult with authorities responsible for standards and engage with the Kenya Bureau of Standards with a view to working out a way forward,\"  Koizumi. In a separate engagement, Mohamed urged Japan to consider assembling motor cycles in Kenya in order to help generate jobs and support growth of the economy. \"This will also enable Japan to meet the East African Community local content requirements and avoid the tariffs imposed on motor cycles,\"  the Cabinet Secretary. Speaking during bilateral talks with Daishio Yamagiwa, Japan State Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Cabinet Secretary  the continued suspension of tariffs on motor cycles could not be guaranteed. At the same time, Mohamed encouraged Japanese companies to participate in the development of a free port in Mombasa in order to expedite the process. The Cabinet secretary expressed appreciation for role JICA is playing in this regard in developing a master plan for the special economic zones in Mombasa. \"Currently, traders in the East and Central Africa region depend on the free port of Dubai for goods. This is expensive considering the distance and the travel and shipping costs involved,\"  Mohamed. \"A free Port in Mombasa will therefore go a long way in reducing costs and consequently enhance intraregional trade,\" added the CS. The Cabinet Secretary  the involvement of Japanese companies in development of the port will enable them access the huge COMESA market with a population of over 450 million people. On the World Trade Organization (WTO) Conference to be hosted in Nairobi this , the Cabinet Secretary reiterated the need for wide consultations in order to thrash out outstanding issues ahead of the conference in December. \"We intend to convene a mini ministerial conference ahead of the main conference to facilitate broad consensus on the deliverables of the MC10 in Nairobi. It is only in this way that we will ensure a successful Conference in December,\"  Mohamed. Urging Japan to participate in the mini ministerial, the CS  she was also reaching out to the European Union and USA whose participation is critical in reaching agreements.',\n",
       " 'Qatar Airways boss accuses Delta of flying \\'crap\\' planes David Harding 16 March 2015 Agence France Presse The chief of Qatar Airways on Monday denied his company receives subsidies and accused rivals Delta Air Lines of flying \"crap\" older planes, escalating hostilities between Gulf and American carriers. Speaking at an arts conference in Doha, Akbar alBaker  any money his airline receives from the state is in the form of \"legitimate\" equity and added his company fleet of aircraft were much cleaner for the environment in comparison to Delta. \"I think Mr Anderson (CEO of Delta, Richard Anderson) doesn\\'t know the difference between equity and subsidy. We never receive any subsidy,\" Baker . \"The state of Qatar is the owner of Qatar Airways and whatever funds are put into the airline is as equity, which is quite legitimate. \"The unfortunate thing is that because they are so inefficient they want to blame us whilst we are very efficient for their failures and drawbacks. \"The issue is that they cannot stand the progress the Gulf carriers are making.\" Baker was responding to claims made earlier this month by three US airlines Delta, American and United that Qatar, along with Etihad Airways and Emirates, received $42 billion in \"unfair\" subsidies to wrest business away from competitors. The US carriers issued a 55page report claiming this has allowed the Gulf airlines to wrest market share from the American airlines. These \"multibillion dollar subsidies\" had distorted the marketplace, \"to the severe detriment of US employment,\" the American carriers claimed. They called on Washington to raise the issue with the UAE and Qatari governments and urged changes to bilateral commercial aviation agreements with them. The UAE, where Etihad and Emirates are based, angrily denied the claims. UAE Economy Minister Sultan alMansouri was quoted as calling them \"false and unacceptable\" by the Emarat AlYoum newspaper. However, European carriers have also joined the argument. Last week, French and German transport ministers called on the European Commission to tackle the issue of subsidies to Gulf carriers. The French transport minister, Alain Vidalies,  the Gulf airlines were benefitting from \"unfair competitive practices\". Baker attack on Monday though was not merely limited to discussions over competition. He also defended Qatar Airway record when it comes to CO2 emissions and unflatteringly compared Delta aircraft to those of his company when asked about aviation pollution. \"I am delighted that Richard Anderson of Delta is not here. First of all, we don\\'t fly crap airplanes that are 35  old. The Qatar Airways average fleet (age) is only fours  and one month,\"  Baker. \"We have ultramodern airplanes. We have invested, my country has invested, huge amounts to make sure we are the lowest CO2 contributor in the aviation industry.\" And he was also damning of those who criticised the aviation industry record on environmental pollution. \"People who make lots of noise about CO2, people who make so much noise about greenhouse gases that are emitted from airplane engines, don\\'t realise that they are constantly travelling by airplane, so they should start walking or going on horseback if they really mean what they say.\"',\n",
       " 'Obama Task Force Outlines Actions to Combat Illegal Fishing, Seafood Fraud By Catherine Boudreau WTO Reporter, March 17, 2015 March 16 — A White House task force outlined what federal agencies will do to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and seafood fraud throughout the supply chain, including leveraging international trade agreements and enhancing traceability programs. The Presidential Task Force on Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Seafood Fraud on March 15 released its action plan based on recommendations the group issued in December. The task force is cochaired by the State and Commerce departments, along with 12 additional federal agencies. “By circumventing conservation and management measures and engaging in fraudulent practices, entities engaging in IUU fishing and seafood fraud undermine the sustainability of U.S. and global fish stocks and negatively impact general ecosystem health,” the report . “At the same time, IUU and fraudulent seafood products distort legal markets and unfairly compete with the catch and seafood products of law abiding fishers and seafood industries.” Global economic losses due to IUU fishing are estimated at as much as $23.5 billion annually, and roughly onethird of the wildcaught seafood imported to the U.S. is illegally caught, according to an April 2014 study published in the journal Marine Policy. The U.S. imports 90 percent of its seafood. The conservation group Oceana in 2013 found that 33 percent of seafood sold at the retail level in the U.S. was mislabeled. Only seven of the 120 samples of red snapper were actually red snapper, commonly swapped for rockfish and tilapia. Shrimp, the most consumed seafood in the U.S., also is misrepresented 30 percent of the time on grocery store labels and restaurant menus, the group reported in October 2014. International IUU Agreements The task force directed the U.S. trade representative to use the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations to combat illegal fishing practices, as countries involved in the talks together account for roughly onequarter of global marine catch and global seafood exports, according to the report. “When complete, TPP will promote long term conservation of marine resources, including sharks and other threatened species,” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman  in a statement. “Not only will these commitments enhance environmental protections, but they will also help safeguard communities and families whose livelihood is put at risk when illegal fishing and harmful fisheries subsidies deplete environmentally and economically fish stocks.” The group also plans to identify at least 14 countries that are supportive of a portstate measures agreement (PSMA) to prevent and eliminate IUU fishing. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and State Department will lead the effort toward ratification, ideally before the end of 2015. Twentyfive countries must ratify the agreement before it enters into force and 11 have so far, including the U.S. Standards in PSMA include designating which ports foreignflagged vessels may enter, restricting port access to vessels that engaged in IUU fishing, conducting dockside inspections and sharing the results when evidence of IUU fishing is found. Many of these procedures are already employed at U.S. ports, but the goal is to export them worldwide. BoattoPlate Traceability An integrated program among federal, state and industry stakeholders also will be developed to facilitate data collection, sharing and analysis to trace seafood and ensure that it is identified correctly. The task force initially will identify atrisk species, or seafood commonly defrauded or subjected to IUU fishing, and collect information such as who harvested or produced the fish, the species and where and when it was harvested and landed. Eventually the group plans to expand the program to all seafood. “The transition from a few high risk species to all needs to be fast,” Beth Lowell, Oceana campaign director, told Bloomberg BNA. “If not, that will just open more holes for illegal seafood to enter the U.S. market. It has to be expanded until we have a fullchain, transparent system from boat to plate.” The task force goal is to knit together information collected by the NOAA and its fishery management partners; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which identifies imported seafood products; and Customs and Border Protection, which enforces other U.S. agency requirements for imported seafood. John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute, a trade group, is concerned about overlapping government efforts and funding. “Calls for greater coordination to avoid duplication and waste of government resources should be heeded,” Connelly  in a statement. “For instance, the FDA has already identified commercial species at risk for fraud through its DNA testing program and NOAA has already identified regions, countries and companies at risk for IUU. Leaning on this already completed work will help avoid duplication.”',\n",
       " 'Asia Pacific Customs Discuss Customs Facilities Jakarta, Mar 16 (Antara) Highlevel customs officials from AsiaPacific countries are discussing the preparations for the implementation of customs facilities that can improve international trading values and volume, here, Monday. Director General of Customs at the Indonesian Ministry of Finance Agung Kuswandono noted that 26 countries in AsiaPacific have sent their representatives to discuss customs facilities. The implementation of these facilities can lower international trading costs by 10 to 15 percent. \"We will review the national system and learn good things from other countries regarding the regulations or facilities for trading,\" Agung remarked. According to Agung, the customs facilities included in the trade facility agreement that have been agreed within the Bali package resulted from the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in December 2014. Earlier, the trading facilities had emerged in the July package from the WTO meeting in 2004. The facilities have been discussed with the objective of creating favorable trading conditions and reducing international trading obstacles. One of the customs facility instruments is the Authorize Economic Operator (AEO), which is being implemented by Indonesia, Agung stated. \"With this system, the exported products from Indonesia will not be checked again in the destination country as long as the items have been certified by the Indonesian authorities,\" he remarked. In a short period of time, five companies will obtain AEO certificates. \"The flow of international trade will be remarkably fast as the checking process will be shortened,\" Agung . AEO is one example of customs instruments, which refers to the World Customs Organization (WCO). The WCO assists its member countries to implement the preparation of the WTO`s trading facilities, one of them through the Mercator Programme module. If the customs trading facility is fully implemented, it will boost global trade by US$1 trillion, create 21 million new jobs, and reduce international trading costs by up to 15 percent.',\n",

France, Germany and Italy have agreed to follow Britain lead and join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Financial Times reported, quoting European officials. The newspaper  the decision by the four countries to become members of the AIIB was a major diplomatic setback for Washington, which has questioned if the new bank will have high standards of governance and environmental and social safeguards. The bank is also seen as contributing to the spread of China \"soft power\" in the region, possibly at the expense of the United States. EU parliament president Martin Schulz  he welcomed the four European nations joining the AIIB, but added the bank must conform to internationally accepted standards. \"I find it good that they join,\" he told reporters while on a visit to Beijing. \"If more member states would join I would find it even better. \"There is one additional element. Such new organizations must answer to the requirements of international standards. That is quite .\" China stateowned Xinhua news agency  South Korea, Switzerland and Luxembourg were also considering joining. On Tuesday, Washington top diplomat for east Asia signalled that the concerns about the AIIB remained, but the decision on whether to join was up to individual nations. \"Our messaging to the Chinese consistently has been to welcome investment in infrastructure but to seek unmistakable evidence that this bank...takes as its starting point the high watermark of what other multilateral development banks have done in terms of governance,\" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel  in Seoul. \"Every government can make its own decision about whether the way to achieve that goal is by joining before the articles of agreement are clarified or by waiting to see what the evidence looks like as the bank starts to operate,\" he told reporters. The AIIB was launched in Beijing last  to spur investment in Asia in transportation, energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure.

       " 'US wants WTO to stamp out evasion of antidumping duties By Tom Miles GENEVA, March 17 (Reuters) The United States wants members of the World Trade Organization to support a crackdown on schemes which help companies evade \"antidumping duties\" punitive import tariffs levied on unfair foreign competition. \"Over the , the United States has witnessed a dramatic increase in activities expressly designed to evade the application of antidumping duties,\" the United States  in a communication to other WTO members. \"Websites marketing such services have been on the rise, and aggressive outreach is luring exporters and/or importers into a false sense of security by offering socalled \\'legitimate\\' services to evade the application of antidumping duties to subject merchandise.\" Dumping happens when producers in one country export into a competitor market at prices that are lower than in their own market. Dumping is often alleged in markets for low addedvalue goods and basic materials such as steel products, chemicals, textiles, fertiliser or farm produce, and accusations often arise when global oversupply threatens producers with losses. The United States has been the second biggest user of antidumping measures since the founding of the WTO in 1995. Only India has taken antidumping steps more often 715 times compared to the U.S. total of 521, up to the end of June 2014. The most frequent target of antidumping measures is China. But China is not only a target: like all big trading powers it is a frequent user of antidumping measures, with 215 instances over the same period. The U.S. communication did not mention which countries were involved, but  the evasion schemes involved shipping goods to an intermediary third country, where they would be reloaded into new containers and provided with false documents to disguise them as goods originating in that country. They could then be shipped to the final destination without incurring any penalty, it . \"This problem has been going on for many . However, it has become more pervasive and the parties have become more brazen in their activities.\" It did not put a value on the evasion but  it threatened to undermine the world trade rules and nullify the effect of antidumping duties. \"Silence or inactivity by the host country may also too easily be construed as tacit approval of, or complicity with, such illicit activities.\" (Editing by Dominic Evans)',\n",

The theme of the current round of negotiations focuses on environmental monitoring, analysis and assessment, resource efficiency and environmentally preferable products, according to an EU statement. The EGA is a plurilateral agreement that would eliminate import tariffs on a mostfavorednation basis, meaning that any dutyfree terms would be applied to all WTO members. Other parties to the negotiations include Australia, Canada, China, Costa Rica, the EU, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan and the U.S. ThreePart Format Discussions during the week of March 16 are to be divided into three sections, the EU . First, the negotiators will meet with experts from international organizations, national environmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, business associations, industry and academia to identify relevant products that could be considered in the negotiations. Second, the negotiators will nominate products related to the theme of the round, on which tariff duties should be eliminated, the EU . Products are nominated on the basis of their potential environmental benefits. Third, the negotiators will review their previous work and discuss further steps in the negotiating process, such as the involvement of new members, the EU . Members also will discuss how to draft a “living agreement” to ensure that the EGA can evolve with future developments in environmental technologies.',\n",

The conference which coming to Africa for the first time is set for Nairobi between December 15 and 18. According to the ministry of foreign affairs, the conference is expected to attract more than 5,000 trade stakeholders from 161 member states. Among top beneficiaries will be hotels, restaurants and transporters which include taxis. The head of economic affairs and international trade in the ministry of foreign affairs, Nelson Ndirangu yesterday  the conference would deliberate on pending issues carried over from the 2013 forum in Bali, Indonesia among other agreements, which have not been properly implemented. These include decisions aimed at streamlining trade, allowing developing countries more options for providing food security, boosting leastdeveloped countries\\' trade and helping development more generally. Ndirangu however  Kenya will push for policies focusing on agriculture, industrial products and development. Ndirangu was addressing journalists in Mombasa during the first technical preparation meeting by the national trade negotiating committee.

       " 'Ambassador: WTO Win For Australian Plain Packaging Could Lead to Alcohol Labeling World Trade Online Posted: March 17, 2015 Indonesia’s Ambassador to the World Trade Organization Iman Pambagyo last week signaled that a win for an Australian law requiring plain packaging of cigarettes as an antismoking measure could lead his country to introduce a similar measure for alcoholic beverages. If the Australian law survived Indonesia’s current challenge in the WTO, it would set a dangerous precedent for countries being able to implement measures that are more traderestrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate policy objective without providing supporting scientific evidence that they could achieve the intended goal, he  in an interview with Inside U.S. Trade. Pambagyo  there have been some officials talking about plain packaging for wine and alcoholic beverages on the ground that Indonesia has a large Muslim population. He  he would not like to see such an expansion of plain packaging in the future. No law on plain packaging for alcoholic products is currently being developed because of Indonesia challenge in the DSB, according to Pambagyo. But he  a WTO win for Australia on this issue would leave the door open for the Indonesian government to expand plain packaging to alcoholic products without needing to justify that the law would advance the legitimate objective of protecting against moral hazards. Indonesia would be able to base its law “on a moral high ground” because Indonesia is a largely Muslim country and many Muslims do not consume alcohol based on religious principles, Pambagyo . Pambagyo’s veiled, carefully worded warning about the possibility of retaliation is more explicit than a fourpage briefing paper on the WTO plain packaging fight that Indonesia prepared to journalists. It says that a win for plain packaging could mean it would spread to other products, such as palm oil or alcoholic beverages “for a religious reason of moral hazards.\" Plain packaging requires companies to use standard colors and typefaces instead of brand logos on package, usually with large health warnings. The law is the last in a series of systematic steps that Australia has undertaken over the  to curtail smoking among its population, in line with the international treaty on tobacco approved by members of the World Health Organization (WHO). Supporters of the law have long made the case that the expansion of plain packaging to products other than tobacco such as sugary drinks is highly unlikely since cigarettes are the only product that will kill people if it is used as intended. They also note that tobacco is the only product that is subject to a WHO treaty called the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which requires signatories to implement a series of policy recommendations that range from tobacco advertisement restrictions and graphic health warnings on packaging to protections from tobacco smoke exposure and the testing and regulating of the contents and emissions of tobacco products. Pambagyo also  Indonesia fears that other countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and Chile will follow Australia example by enacting plain packaging measures on tobacco products. For instance, Irish President Michael Higgins signed into law plain packaging measures on March 10, according to the president website. In its WTO challenge of Australia’s measure, Indonesia included a violation of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), which requires WTO signatories to refrain from imposing technical regulations that are more trade restrictive than necessary to achieve a legitimate policy objective in technical regulations, taking into account of the risks nonfulfillment. The TBT article contains an illustrative list of possible legitimate policy objectives, including the protection of human health or safety, but not the prevention of moral hazards. The risks of nonfulfillment can be assessed by relevant “scientific and technical information” among others, according to Article 2.2. Indonesia and the other complainants have charged that the Australian law was adopted without prior presentation of scientific analysis showing that its measures could meet the intended objective. Australia has claimed its law is backed by several studies showing that such a requirement will help reduce smoking if it is part of a comprehensive set of tobacco control measures. The law was recommended by Australia National Preventative Health Task Force, which  its findings were backed by 12 peerreviewed research papers and nine additional studies that are publicly available. Additionally, Indonesia’s briefing paper claims that an analysis conducted since the implementation of Australia law in 2013 has shown that law has had no effect on Australian smoking rates. According to the briefing paper, Indonesia does not oppose any effort to address the harmful effects of tobacco products and itself taken measures to discourage smoking. This includes a regulation that requires graphic health warnings on 40 percent of a cigarette pack compared to the 30 percent minimum required by the WHO framework. The briefing paper notes that some signatories of the framework have not implemented that minimum requirement. The brief also claims that some of Indonesia smoking regulations are stricter or as strict than those of major economies including the European Union. Indonesia considers that its graphic warning requirement is less trade restrictive than necessary because it does not deny the use of a trademark, as does the Australian law, Pambagyo . The objective of protecting public morals is a possible exception to otherwise prevailing trade obligations under Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Article XX allows members to impose measures necessary to protect public morals under the condition that they are not a disguised trade restriction and do not constitute an unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail. In the WTO case, Indonesia also charges a violation of Article 2.1 of the TBT, which states that members shall give imports treatment that is “no less favourable” than that of like products of national origin. It also charges that it is a violation of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), including the rights of trademark owners and rules on geographic indications (GIs). In the WTO fight, Indonesia has claimed that the Australian measures do not allow cigarettes to display trademarks, GIs, or “any other marking other than an alphanumeric code for product identification purposes.” It has charged that this constitutes violations of Articles 22.2(b) and 24.3 of TRIPS, which apply to GIs. Article 22.2(b) protects against “unfair competition” as defined by the 1967 Paris Convention, which defines unfair competition as acts that “create confusion by any means whatever with the establishment, the goods, or the industrial or commercial activities, of a competitor.” Indonesia has also charged that the Australian law violates TRIPS Article 20, which state that the use of a trademark shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements. Indonesia requested a panel on March 3, 2014 and one was subsequently established on March 26, 2014. Indonesia is joined by Honduras, Cuba, Ukraine and the Dominican Republic as cocomplainants. In October 2014, the DSB panel announced it would not issue a ruling before the first half of 2016.',\n",
       " 'Obama administration questions U.S. airlines on subsidy claims source By Jeffrey Dastin WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) The Obama administration has asked U.S. airlines for more information on their claims that Gulf carriers have received marketdistorting subsidies, marking its first written response to U.S. airlines\\' lobbying effort, Reuters has learned. The administration asked U.S. airline representatives about 20 questions in writing last week about their method in determining the subsidy allegations and about the market harm they say Gulf carriers have caused them, according to a person familiar with the matter. U.S. airlines hope to provide the government answers within 10 days, the person . While the administration has not taken a stance, the request reflects the growing focus on the debate in Washington. The source  the questions were factual and did not suggest the administration was either swayed or skeptical. Leaders in the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure have recently called on the administration to look into the allegations, while U.S. airlines repeated their request Tuesday for the United States to open talks with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on the \"Open Skies\" agreements that authorize flying between the nations. The Gulf carriers, meanwhile, have stepped up their defense. \"We make no apologies for offering new competitive choice for air travelers,\" Etihad Airways Chief Executive Officer James Hogan  in a speech on Tuesday, adding that the airline supports more than 200,000 U.S. jobs and is transparent about what he emphasized were loans, not subsidies, provided to it by the government of Abu Dhabi, its shareholder.

The remarks by Etihad Chief Executive James Hogan, at an aviation conference Tuesday organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, were a response to allegations by the three largest U.S. airlines that Etihad and two other Persian Gulf carriers Emirates Airline of Dubai and Qatar Airways of Doha have received more than $40 billion in tradedistorting government subsidies since 2004. Mr. Hogan  Etihad has had to build its aviation infrastructure from scratch, whereas U.S. and European carriers enjoy a mature system. Given that, he , the equity investments and loans by its owner, the government of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, were a reasonable step to get the carrier up and running after its founding since 2003. Tim Clark, president of fastgrowing Emirates Airline also took vigorous exception Tuesday to the U.S. carriers\\' claims. Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Clark  his company was established 30  ago under \"clear rules of no subsidies\" and hasn\\'t deviated from that approach except for receiving \"seed capital\" when it was just getting under way. The government of Dubai gives \"no support for the operation,\" he , and it expects Emirates to make its own way. In late January, American Airlines Group Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. began circulating to Washington policy makers a 55page report that alleges Emirates and its Gulf rivals, Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi and Dohabased Qatar Airways, have received more than $40 billion in subsidies and unfair advantages since 2004. The three big U.S. airlines are pressing their government to try to persuade the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to amend their liberal air treaties with the U.S. to \"level the playing field.\" Failing that, the three big U.S. airlines want Gulf carrier access to be frozen or for the treaties to be revoked. Mr. Clark  he made the rounds in Washington among the same policy makers and found the discussions \"very constructive.\" He vowed that his airline will formulate \"a linebyline\" response to the lengthy U.S. report and will \"rebut\" all the allegations. He also mentioned \"being given the benefit of an apology\" by the people who made them, and questioned why the report wasn\\'t made public and visible to him and his Gulf rivals until two weeks ago. Emirates, which now serves nine U.S. cities with 84 flights a week, intends to serve 20 U.S. airports, Mr. Clark .

       " \"Canadian Court Rejects Skechers Appeal of Adding R&D Costs to Dutiable Cost By Peter Menyasz WTO Reporter, March 18, 2015 March 17— A Canadian court rejected an appeal by Skechers USA Canada Inc. to a decision by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to include all research and development (R&D) costs paid by Skechers to its U.S. parent when the agency set the dutiable value of footwear purchases (Skechers USA Canada Inc. v. Canada Border Services Agency,Federal Court of Appeal, No. A12114, 3/2/15 ). Skechers USA did not respond to a March 17 request for comment or to the question of whether it would seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) correctly found a sufficient link between the R&D payments and footwear imported by Skechers to warrant including the payments in the goods' dutiable value, the Federal Court of Appeal  March 2 in its unanimous ruling, made public March 16. Acceptable Outcomes The tribunal finding falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes and is defensible based on the facts and law, Justice David G. Near  in his ruling. Skechers Canada purchases footwear designed by its U.S. parent and manufactured offshore by third parties, and the transfer price paid to Skechers USA Inc. includes the factory price paid to the manufacturers and the cost of shipping the goods to the U.S. and warehousing them, plus an armlength profit, the ruling . The Canadian subsidiary also pays the U.S. parent under a costsharing agreement for development and maintenance of the Skechers brand, including research, development, design, advertising and marketing, it . The amounts are a percentage of Skechers USA total annual costs for those activities, based on a ratio of Skechers Canada operating profit to the total anticipated operating profits of all participants in the agreement, it . A 2006 CBSA audit found that a portion of the R&D payments made under the costsharing agreement should be included in the “price paid or payable” by Skechers Canada for the imports, the court ruling . Skechers Canada requested a redetermination in December 2012, leading the border agency to issue seven decisions under Section 60(4) of the Customs Act that all R&D payments must be included for goods imported between 2005 and 2011. Skechers Canada appealed to the CITT in March 2013, which in December 2013 upheld the border agency conclusions. Skechers Canada appeal argued that the CITT ruling was unreasonable, alleging specifically that the tribunal erred by imposing an improper burden of proof, misinterpreting the Act and the costsharing agreement and failing to properly apply relevant jurisprudence, the ruling . But the tribunal made no error in requiring Skechers Canada to prove the R&D payments were not “in respect of” the goods, it . The appellate court also rejected Skechers Canada argument that the R&D costs associated with unsuccessful styles and styles that are never imported into Canada should not be included in the cost of the goods. The court rejected Skechers Canada argument that the CITT contradicted Decision 5.1 of the World Trade Organization Committee on Customs Valuation, which found in May 1995 that costs incurred solely for research do not represent “development or design” work. The firm conceded that its R&D payments were not actually assists, so the tribunal was under no obligation to consider the WTO ruling, it .\",\n",

The concerted move by U.S. allies to participate in Beijing flagship economic outreach project is a diplomatic blow to the United States and its efforts to counter the fastgrowing economic and diplomatic influence of China. Europe participation reflects the eagerness to partner with China economy, the world second largest, and comes amid prickly trade negotiations between Brussels and Washington. European Union and Asian governments are frustrated that the U.S. Congress has held up a reform of voting rights in the International Monetary Fund that would give China and other emerging powers more say in global economic governance. Washington insists it has not actively discouraged countries from joining the new bank, but it has questioned whether the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will have sufficient standards of governance and environmental and social safeguards. \"I hope before the final commitments are made anyone who lends their name to this organization will make sure that the governance is appropriate,\" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told U.S. lawmakers. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble announced at a joint news conference with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai that Germany, Europe biggest economy and a major trade partner of Beijing, would be a founding member of the AIIB. In a joint statement, the foreign and finance ministers of Germany, France and Italy  they would work to ensure the new institution \"follows the best standards and practices in terms of governance, safeguards, debt and procurement policies.\" In a short statement, China Ministry of Finance  it welcomed the decision and hoped to receive written confirmation soon. \"If all goes smoothly, France, Italy and Germany could formally become founding members of the AIIB two weeks after,\" it . Luxembourg Finance Ministry also confirmed the country, a big financial centre, has applied to be a founding member of the $50 billion AIIB. The AIIB was launched in Beijing last  to spur investment in Asia in transport, energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure. It was seen as a rival to the Westerndominated World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. China has  it will use the best practices of those institutions. NOT AN ACCIDENT The World Bank is traditionally run by a U.S. nominee and Washington also has the most influence at the IMF. The United States and Japan are the dominant members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The planned reforms at the IMF would double the fund resources and hand more voting power to countries such as the BRICS Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The adjustment of shares and voting rights was brokered by Britain at a Group of 20 summit in 2010, and European countries ratified it long ago. Lew told lawmakers that the U.S. delay in ratifying the agreement was undermining its credibility and influence as countries question the United States\\' commitment to international institutions. \"It not an accident that emerging economies are looking at other places because they are frustrated that, frankly, the United States has stalled a very mild and reasonable set of reforms in the IMF,\" Lew . Some Republicans have complained the changes would cost too much at a time Washington is running big budget deficits. The reforms have also ran afoul of a growing isolationist trend among the party influential Tea Party wing. China  earlier this  a total of 26 countries had been included as AIIB founder members, mostly from Asia and the Middle East. It plans to finalise the articles of agreement by the end of the . China stateowned Xinhua news agency  South Korea and Switzerland were also considering joining. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei would not comment on which countries had applied, and repeated that the bank would be \"open, inclusive, transparent and responsible.\" Washington says it sees a role for the AIIB given Asia immense infrastructure needs and regards it as a potential partner for established institutions like the ADB. But its strategy of questioning the AIIB standards has drawn criticism from some observers, who say the administration should have been more accepting of the new bank or offered alternatives within existing institutions.',\n",
       " 'Azevedo Welcomes Proposals For Alternative Modalities, But Urges Specificity Inside U.S. Trade 03/20/2015 World Trade Organization DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo this week  members floating papers and proposals on new approaches for cutting tariffs in future agriculture and nonagricultural market access (NAMA) negotiations in the Doha round must provide specific numbers on the cuts to allow a concrete assessment of their outcomes. Such numbers would allow the WTO to run simulations that would show the results of the proposed tariff cuts for different members, Azevedo  at an informal March 18 meeting of the heads of delegations in Geneva. This would allow them to compare the results of a new approach to the outcome of the 2008 modalities for agriculture and NAMA. Geneva sources have  that some members are reluctant to consider changes from the 2008 agriculture and NAMA modalities because they understand their outcome, which is also defined by the various exemptions negotiated from the otherwise prevailing formulas (Inside U.S. Trade, Feb. 27). Azevedo made the comments in response to a call by the European Union that the work in the negotiating groups must accelerate. Japan spoke up at the meeting in support of discussing specific numbers in the context of exploring alternative modalities, but no other delegations addressed this issue. In smaller meetings happening in Geneva, the United States and EU have also indicated that they would like to see the use of average tariff cuts coupled with the requestoffer approach in future proposals, but neither committed to putting forth a proposal, according to Geneva sources. So far, Argentina has tabled a formal proposal for a requestoffer methodology for agriculture and NAMA as well as services, but that approach by nature does not include a prescribed level of tariff cuts like a formula would. In the agriculture discussions, Paraguay has tabled a nonpaper that combines the use of average and minimum tariff cuts, similar to those used in the Uruguay Round. According to the nonpaper, circulated to WTO members on Feb. 25, members would use the average formula with minimum cuts for each tariff line akin to the method used in the Uruguay Round with the added step of allowing members to seek additional cuts through bilateral and plurilateral requests and offers. The formula and the minimum cuts would differ whether a country is developed, developing or a small and vulnerable economy or a very recently acceded country. The nonpaper includes numbers for potential cuts, but they are placed in brackets suggesting that Paraguay is not wedded to them. For instance, developed countries would be required cut each tariff line by at least 20 percent for a total average of of at least 54 percent, according to the Paraguay nonpaper. Developing countries would submit an offer with a maximum average cut of 36 percent with a minimum cut of 15 percent per tariff line. Small and Vulnerable Economies and Recently Acceded Members would be obligated to a maximum 24 percent average cut, but would not be subject to a minimum cut. The average cuts were bracketed, indicating the specific number is still to be negotiated. Types of requests would include members asking for trading partners to eliminate or reduce tariffs, bind unbound tariff lines, and create tariffrate quotas (TRQ) or expanding the volume of an existing TRQ. There is no consensus on these two ideas, but the EU on March 18  the proposals by Argentina and Paraguay would be helpful because they are simpler methods than the 2008 draft modalities. Specifically, the EU  Paraguay proposal would be useful because it employed average tariff cuts in the agriculture, according to a Geneva source. But more ly, there is no consensus on whether there need to be alternatives to the 2008 modalities, a point that Azevedo clearly reflected in his remarks to the heads of delegation. \"There is a clear sense that members are moving into a solutionfinding mode. The discussion is much more focused than it has been to date,\" he . \"But, while we are making progress, this does not yet mean we are converging. There remain many challenges to overcome before we can find solutions but at least now we are looking for them.\" Azevedo also  that he would hold off on conducting intensive consultations until the chairmen of the negotiating committees on agriculture and NAMA work through more issues and identify specific bottlenecks that need to be handled at a higher political level, according to a Geneva source. This source  that such bottlenecks would be distinct problems that members have identified with particular proposals.',\n",
       " \"WTO Members Continue Searching for Solutions to Doha Impasse By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 19, 2015 March 18 — World Trade Organization members face some heavy lifting to resolve the challenges that have dogged the latest Doha round negotiations, WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo told members at an informal heads of delegation meeting. “While we are making progress, this does not yet mean we are converging,” Azevedo  at the meeting. “There remain many challenges to overcome before we can find solutions.” Members have presented a slew of new proposals aimed at replacing the WTO 2008era negotiation texts but continue to disagree on the best approach to modernize multilateral trade rules. The deep disagreements, particularly in the realm of agricultural domestic support, present a major challenge to WTO members' effort to conclude the 2001 Doha round. The March 18 meeting was the third of the Heads of Delegation meetings to be held before the July 31 deadline set by members to produce a highly developed and precise work program. Agriculture Negotiations Stall The sharp differences among members in the WTO agriculture negotiations generally have lowered the level of ambition for nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services negotiations, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA. Members remain divided over the viability of the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4), which are formulas for reducing tradedistorting measures. China recently rejected a U.S. proposal for emerging economies to adjust their levels of tradedistorting domestic support in addition to the provisions outlined in Rev. 4 (45 WTO, 3/9/15). Chinese Ambassador Yu Jianhua  that his government would make no contribution toward new disciplines on domestic support and noted that, on a per capita basis, Chinese farmers receive a much smaller fraction of agricultural subsidies when compared to the subsidies the U.S. provides to its farmers. The disagreement between China and the U.S. is one of the key issues that needs to be resolved if members are to achieve any Doha goals by the Dec. 15–18 ministerial conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Paraguay Proposal Panned Rev. 4 supporters reacted skeptically to a recent proposal by Paraguay aimed at seeking average domestic tariff cuts, Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg BNA. Paraguay proposal, which circulated last week in Geneva, suggested that developed countries could apply, in six equal annual installments, a maximum average cut of 54 percent and a minimum cut of 20 percent per tariff line (43 WTO, 3/5/15). Under the proposal, developing countries could apply, in 11 equal annual installments, a maximum average tariff cut of 54 percent and a minimum cut of 15 percent per tariff line. Small and vulnerable economies and new WTO members could offer a maximum average cut of 24 percent. Some emerging and developing economies see little advantage in pursuing average tariff cuts when they consider Rev. 4 as offering more favorable terms, Geneva trade officials . John Adank, the chairman of the WTO Agriculture Committee in Special Session, will convene a pair of informal meetings on March 20 to further discuss agricultural market access, domestic support and public stockholding for food security purposes. Swiss vs. Argentine Formula Members remain “quite a distance apart” as to whether the Swiss formula to obtain NAMA tariff cuts remains achievable, according to Remigi Winzap, the chairman of the NAMA negotiations committee. Some members criticized the formula, which seeks to apply a mathematical formula to apply tariff cuts to certain products, for being complicated and too politically difficult. Members are now considering alternative proposals aimed at achieving tariff cuts, such as Argentina request and offer proposal. Argentina proposal would permit members to bilaterally, plurilaterally or multilaterally strike deals to reduce tariff restrictions on goods and services, and then apply those cuts on a mostfavorednation basis (48 WTO, 3/12/15). In comments delivered at the Heads of Delegation meeting, Winzap  that he heard “many skeptical voices” suggest that Argentina proposal would be less predictable than the Swiss formula. Other members—like South Africa and Argentina—told Winzap that the Swiss formula is simply not doable. “I sense an openness by most members to look more closely at an approach for cutting tariffs with a formula based on an average cut,” Winzap . “Should we move towards an average formula approach, such modalities would in the view of some members have to be complemented by other features like possibly minimum cuts.” Services Negotiations Lacking Azevedo  that members are lagging behind in the services negotiations and urged them to consider what is possible in that area. The negotiations, which are aimed at modernizing and clarifying international rules regarding the trade in services—like telecommunications, banking, insurance, construction, distribution and transportation—have lain dormant since the 2008 Signalling Conference. The conference was intended to provide countries with a level of comfort through exchanging “signals” on market access issues. Members of the Trade in Services Council previously  that discussion of the scope of the services negotiations would be premature, as members continue to disagree about the way forward in agriculture and NAMA negotiations (37 WTO, 2/25/15). Azevedo warned members not to focus too closely on the sequencing of the various negotiations and to move forward on services talks in concert with the agriculture and NAMA negotiations.\",\n",
       " \"Indonesia Shrugs Off U.S., New Zealand WTO Challenge to Import Restrictions By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 20, 2015 March 19 — Indonesia ambassador to the World Trade Organization  he wasn't surprised by the joint U.S., New Zealand dispute against Indonesia agricultural import restrictions which they say unfairly discriminate against foreign products. “This is business and we respect the rights and obligations of all members in WTO,”  Indonesian Ambassador Iman Pambagyo. “Indonesia will follow the procedures in handling this case,” he told Bloomberg BNA via email on March 19. “A country requesting the establishment of a dispute panel in WTO is not something new,” Pambagyo . “Members have the rights to do so if they believe that their commercial interest is compromised by the policy of other members.” The U.S. and New Zealand argue that Indonesia 2012 import licensing regimes unfairly discriminate against imports of foreign poultry, beef, apples, grapes, potatoes and other horticultural products. Import Licensing Regime The case stems from a series of Indonesian trade restrictions and prohibitions that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  is costing U.S. importers $200 million per  in lost revenues. The U.S. and New Zealand claim Indonesia import licensing rules impose timing mandates, minimum price restrictions and quantitative restrictions and set high delivery fulfillment requirements to ensure import licenses aren't suspended or revoked. The measures, “when viewed as a single regime and also when viewed as requirements operating separately or in combination, are inconsistent” with Indonesia WTO obligations, according to the U.S. dispute filing. Specifically, the U.S.  Indonesian import restrictions violate Article XI:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Article 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, which prohibit restrictions on the importation of goods, including those made effective through import licenses. The U.S., New Zealand and Indonesia have held consultations in the past, which resulted in Indonesia agreement to revise the regulations. The U.S.  the revisions were inadequate and the parties could not resolve their dispute during consultations held on June 19, 2014. Initial Request A WTO spokesman confirmed the organization had received the U.S. and New Zealand dispute request, though it had not yet set a date to consider them. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body will consider an initial request for a panel to study the dispute, potentially as soon as its next meeting on March 25. Under WTO rules, Indonesia has the right to reject an initial panel request after which a second investigation may not be denied.\",\n",
       " 'US, NZ challenge RI at WTO over import rules Linda Yulisman, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta 20 March 2015 The Jakarta Post The US and New Zealand have requested the establishment of a dispute settlement panel at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to resolve their disagreements with Indonesia over horticulture and animal trade. The proposed panel would examine Indonesia wideranging import rules, which both countries consider \"import restrictions\", on fruits and vegetables, such as apples, grapes and potatoes, animal products, particularly beef and poultry, and other agricultural products, according to a statement from the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR). Among the measures it pointed to were a ban on imports of poultry and certain meat products and an import licensing system for horticultural products. USTR Michael Froman  that Indonesia measures had \"unfairly limited opportunities\" for US farmers and ranchers to ship their products to its large and growing market. \"I\\'m proud to take this action today standing up on behalf of farmers and ranchers across the US who have been shouldering unfair export barriers to the fourthlargest country in the world, Indonesia,\" Froman  in the statement released on Wednesday. He added that the US had been working closely with New Zealand in this case and that its partner had made a similar demand to the global trade governing body. Indonesia, home to 250 million people, in 2012 put in place a set of regulations to restructure horticultural imports, comprising a restriction on import gateways and special Trade Ministry import permits for horticultural produce. The country largest port, Tanjung Priok in North Jakarta, which processes more than half of all horticultural imports, was closed as its capacity overload had led to poor supervision of imports and outbreaks of disease in some parts of the sprawling archipelago The country also imposed several restrictions on animal imports as a result of health concerns. The measures include requiring importers to register, granting special import licenses and tightening up scrutiny of imported animals. The US has already once taken Indonesia to the WTO, with the latter agreeing to address some of the concerns by revising its licensing procedures for horticultural imports, such as through a onestop online import licensing service. However, apparently still dissatisfied, the US renewed its complaint to the WTO in May last , joining forces with New Zealand. The US, which pays sizeable annual agricultural subsidies, registered an alltime high US$155.1 billion of agricultural shipments worldwide last , supporting more than a million farmers. Nearly $200 million worth of its agricultural exports were affected by Indonesia licensing regime last . Exports of the affected horticultural products to Southeast Asia top economy surpassed $122 million, including $50 million of apples and more than $37 million of grapes, while sales of the affected animals and animal products reached $63.2 million. In addition to the US and New Zealand, Indonesia may face another challenge by Brazil, which has already lodged one failed complaint. In response to the US and New Zealand dispute settlement proposal, Indonesian Ambassador to the WTO Iman Pambagyo  that Indonesia would follow settlement procedures under the adjudication of the WTO and was prepared to defend its policies. \"Our policies do not violate WTO rules and we leave it to the panel to decide,\" he . Indonesia, according to the USTR, has breached the WTO General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and Agreement on Agriculture.',\n",

The decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission paved the way for a suspension agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments that establishes floor values and puts a caps on volumes for imports from Mexico. The commissioners voted 60 in favor of the agreement, responding to challenges from two U.S. refiners, Louis Dreyfus Commodities' Imperial Sugar Co and AmCane Sugar LLC, that  they would be harmed by the agreedupon restrictions. The dispute has roiled North American trade flows of the sweetener since late March 2014, when a group representing U.S. sugar companies and growers petitioned the U.S. government for antidumping, antisubsidy duties. The refiners have separately requested the U.S. Department of Commerce continue the investigation, which was suspended when the pact was finalized in late December. The agency has not yet decided on whether the two companies, neither of which was on the original petition, are in a position to make that request.

No international trade rules or precedent by the United States exists for addressing airline subsidy claims, presenting a challenge for the administration as it determines how to proceed, a person familiar with the matter . U.S. airlines contend that Gulf carriers can lower prices and offer more amenities on newer planes because of state subsidies. These issues do not fall under World Trade Organization rules but rather under bilateral \"Open Skies\" agreements that authorize commercial flying between countries. The agreements are silent on how to handle most subsidy claims, the source . Yet alleged subsidies of more than $40 billion to Gulf airlines make the claim the largest that the administration has encountered and must be taken seriously, the source added. Last week, the administration asked U.S. airlines some 20 questions about the allegations. \"The (U.S. government) interagency team did in fact ask the U.S. airlines and their consultants several technical and clarifying questions about the data and information contained in their report,\" U.S. Department of Transportation Press Secretary Ryan Daniels  in a statement, confirming a Reuters report. \"However, we are in the early stages of thoroughly reviewing this matter in close coordination with our interagency partners,\" he . The Obama administration has filed trade complaints on issues ranging from China imposition of extra duties on American cars to India ban on certain U.S. agricultural goods to allegedly protect against avian influenza. Aviation also has been at the center of a decadeold dispute in which the World Trade Organization found that planemakers from the United States and the European Union had received illegal subsidies. But Genevabased watchdog rules do not apply to air traffic rights or airline services, although it keeps these under review broadly. Meanwhile, the dispute between U.S. and Gulf airlines has escalated.

Announcing the creation of the antitobacco trade litigation fund yesterday, Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  countries having limited resources should not be bullied into making bad health policy choices. \"This new fund is going to help countries who are sued by the tobacco industry fight back in court and win,\" Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and one of the world richest people, told reporters in a telebriefing. Bloomberg and Gates, the billionaire cofounder of Microsoft, cited examples such as Uruguay, which had, since 2010, been fighting a legal challenge by the cigarette maker Philip Morris International against the use of graphic health warnings on tobacco products. Australia too, had been fending off a World Trade Organization challenge and a legal challenge by Philip Morris against its antitobacco laws (See: Australia may be hit with the third WTO suit over tobacco packaging (/industry/Tobacco/20120615_tobacco_packaging.html)). According to Bloomberg, the tobacco industry use of international trade agreements to threaten and prevent countries from passing tobacco control laws was unacceptable. \"This is not about trade,\" he . \"No one is a stronger supporter of capitalism and trade than I am.

The question may have gotten muddier on Wednesday as the American Association of Exporters and Importers (AAEI) announced that it and the Asian Shippers\\' Association (ASA) and the European Shippers\\' Council (ESC) have formed a new group called the Global Shippers\\' Alliance (GSA). The new Global Shippers’ Alliance could be seen as a rival to the Global Shippers Forum, which was formed in 2006 and to which the National Industrial Transportation League, the largest shippers’ group in the U.S. belongs. The Global Shippers’ Forum was created in 2006 as a successor to the informal Tripartite Shippers’ Group. Its website  it was created so that shippers could get “formal recognition, consultation status and accreditation with the major UN agencies such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Labor Organization (ILO) and the World Customs Organization (WCO).\" But the ESC did not join the GSF and the Asian Shippers’ Council (ASC) later left the group, after disagreement about representation and membership fees in the global group. Other members of the GSF include the Freight Management Association of Canada, Freight Transport Association (FTA) in Europe, the Consejo de Cargadores (CAC & UIA), Argentina, the Union of African Shippers’ Councils, the South African Shippers\\' Council, the Australian Peak Shippers\\' Association and the New Zealand Shippers\\' Council. The European Shippers Council  the new \"GSA intends to engage in constructive dialogue with national governments, supranational bodies, NGO’s, transport organizations and organizations of logistic service providers and strive for better cooperation so international trade can thrive, economies can grow and society can benefit. Subjects that are  to shippers are, amongst others, fair pricing of transport including surcharges in maritime and air transport, proper competition, security and customs regulations, standardization to facilitate data exchange, terminal handling charges and service levels in international transport.\" A major rift developed two  ago between the shipper groups over whether to support an IMO regulation to require verification of container weight. GSF supported the regulation, while the Asian and European groups opposed it. AEEI President and CEO Marianne Rowden  of the new group, “We really did not design it to be a rival organization and the European Shippers Council has been a partner for a couple of  now. Typically we have had partnerships with national associations who concentrate their efforts on trade compliance, regulatory issues, trade legislation as well some shipping issues,” including many of the European national associations. She  AAEI began working with the ESC \"to present a united front to negotiators of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\" AAEI also has partnerships with Canadian and Mexican trade organizations. Rowden  the new Global Shippers Alliance is supposed to be \"an umbrella organization for all of us.\" “It will look at shipping issues particularly there are some lingering issues from the West Coast port labor negotiations. There are surcharge issues that we’re looking at. But another component of it which most shipper associations don’t do is we are looking at trade facilitation — the WTO trade facilitation agreement and its implementation, advanced data for cargo, it’s a real blend of both pure transportation, shipping issues as well as trade issues.” She  her group has a “very good working relationship with the NIT League and we try not to overlap with what they do they are a pure shippers’ association in terms of representing those issues as a transportation issue.

In the second dedicated session this  to clinch a deal to the factious issue of food stockpiling, the Genevabased World Trade Organisation (WTO) saw the G33 rejecting a proposal by the US which comprises three main elements. They were reviewing efficacy and trade effects of existing food security programs and the extent to which they meet their goals, evaluating the real and potential problems encountered in implementing food security programs because of constraints in the existing WTO rules and drawing from the best practices and recommendations on food stockpiling. Best practices in food stockpiling would include programs in states that are most economical, targeted and effective and ones that are not trade distorting and have enhanced transparency. India  the the US proposal may result in an outcome where countries are advised as to what kind of food security programs they should adopt which is not part of the existing mandate. In trying to address the food security issue visavis the proposal one of the outcomes could be a decision on public stockholding whereas the mandate is the other way round, India argued. Indonesia, speaking on behalf of the G33 countries which also includes China and the Philippines,  that the real issue is getting a permanent solution not to engage in an academic program or to expand the mandate to review existing programs. The informal meeting also saw the playing out of the old hardened battle lines between the proponents of the G33 proposal and the opponents of it. The G33 proposal suggests to amend the Agriculture Amendment to provide new flexibilities, for programs when governments buy food from lowincome farmers at supported prices to build up stocks, to be shifted from the Amber Box all domestic support measures considered to distort production and trade to the Green Boxsubsidies that do not distort trade or cause minimum distortion.

An interim peace clause was brokered last  in November, when India had blocked the global Trade Facilitation Agreement to find a solution to the stockpiling logjam, which protected developing countries from legal consequences if it exceeded its Amber Box limits as a result of stockholding for food security.

The preferential treatment for LDCs, that was initiated by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its ninth ministerial conference held in Bali in December 2013 has gathered momentum. As the developed countries had made a commitment of extending a waiver on trade in services and service suppliers, LDCs had collectively sent a proposal for the operationalisation of the waiver. Canada, in this regard is the first country to send a notification to the Council for Trade in Services of WTO outlining the services where it will provide the facility. As per its notification, Canada will allow temporary movement of natural persons, who have specialised knowledge and capacity. It has mentioned that in case of a business visitor it will allow 90 days for their visit. Canada will also permit undergraduate students to work off campus without work permit for up to 20 hours per week during regular academic sessions and full time during scheduled breaks. It will also allow students from LDCs to work in Canada after they graduate. Considering the collective request of the LDCs, Canada has promised to provide full market access for construction works to maritime agency services. Other professional services such as accounting, auditing and bookkeeping, investigation and security and veterinary services will also be covered, as per the notification. Canada has welcomed producers of LDCs to produce audiovisual projects with Canadian producers through coventures. In addition, training opportunities can be extended for technical jobs in film, television and new media. Regarding financial services, it has extended facilities to LDCs to open subsidiaries of financial institutions, fullservice branches or lending branches. The framework for foreign bank branches allows LDC service suppliers a choice of juridical forms that provide for specific business powers and regulatory requirements, as per notification. Canada will exempt tax on any income of LDC resident earned in Canada from international shipping or from operation of an aircraft in international traffic on the reciprocity. The exemption includes income from logistical services when they are incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic like accounting and marketing. Besides, Canada has also offered 50 per cent reduction on fees for companies and individuals of LDCs during registration and maintenance of patents, geographical indications (GIs), trademark and industrial design at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Council for Trade in Services has circulated notification to all member LDCs. Following the Bali ministerial conference, LDCs had collectively requested for implementation of the Bali Promise on July 21, 2014.',\n",

Sigmar Gabriel, of Germanys centerleft Social Democrats (SPD) party, who is also the countrys deputy chancellor, told Munichbased newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday that what the SPD doesnt want wont happen. The European Commission is aiming to stop negotiation disparities from obstructing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal. The agreement could encompass almost half the global economy and could potentially generate $100 billion (92 billion euros) in added economic output for the US and EU. The European Parliament and other opponents of the TTIP accord fear that US multinationals will use a special clause an InvestorState Dispute Settlement (ISDS) to test Europes laws on food, labor and environment. Many US companies argue that such regulations restrict free commerce. Washington has  it will not accept a deal without a provision allowing ISDS challenges to the EUs usually stricter regulatory laws. The dispute centers on the use of arbitrators, or independent judges, to settle disputes between national governments and companies that feel they have been treated unjustly, such as by a certain law or expropriation. Protestors and politicians alike have expressed concern that big companies could impose undue control over governments, thereby undermining the rule of law.

The EU law mandates that European countries doing outsourcing business with countries that are not certified as data secure have to follow stringent contractual obligations, which increases operating costs and affects competitiveness. Data security issue is very  for India. It will be difficult for the Commerce Ministry to move forward on the free trade pact without getting clarity on data security matter, the source . No negotiations were held after both sides failed to bridge substantial gaps on crucial issues in May 2013. The EU should come on the table with incremental approach. India could consider their demands of reducing duties on wines, spirits and automobiles, the source added. India and EU are negotiating Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) that will include trade in goods, services and investments since June 2007. Besides demanding significant duty cuts in automobiles, EU wants tax reduction in wines and spirits and dairy products and a strong intellectual property regime. The domestic auto industry is concerned that any concessions in the sector on demands by the bloc would have farreaching consequences for it and have an impact on the Modi governments Make in India initiative. Recently, the European Union sought a political push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restart the stalled talks for the agreement and had expressed readiness to adopt flexibility to iron out differences on crucial issues.

       " 'No beef, no TPP entry: US experts By William Lowther Staff reporter in Washington Taipei Times 22 March 2015 Taiwan will never be allowed into the proposed TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement until it removes restrictions on the import of US beef and pork, a conference on USTaiwan relations was told on Friday. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of agricultural issues, especially beef and pork, to [US] Congressional House and Senate attitudes about the TPP, analyst Chris Nelson . A former Congress staff member with decades of experience on USTaiwan issues, Nelson  that until the US agricultural community had signed off on the TPP, it aint going to happen. If the agricultural community does not get what it wants from Taiwan on the beef and pork issues, he , Taiwan would not gain entrance to the TPP. If Taiwan wants to get into TPP and it is still screwing around on beef and pork, it is not going to meet the basic qualification and be taken seriously, Nelson . Asked if a solution to the beef and pork issue was a prerequisite to gaining US support for Taiwanese entry to the TPP in a second round of negotiations that could start later this , former Congressional Research Service specialist in Asian security affairs Shirley Kan : The fact that you even have to ask this question just astonishes me. This is serious, she . Are you in denial? We have heard all the arguments and excuses from Taiwan, she . How they cant do a thing, because elections are coming up. Well, there are no elections this  in Taiwan. Lets not waste this . If people are serious, this is the window of opportunity. Whether you use it or not is up to you. She  that Taiwan had a lot of work to do to restore trust as a reliable economic partner that relied on scientific and international standards. Taiwan has to by itself, today remove the remaining obstacles concerning beef and pork, she . Kan  that, if this was not done, people might look back in  to come and say that Taipei had committed a strategic blunder. Will Taiwan let this opportunity go? she asked. Kan  that it was ironic that the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) could not forge a domestic political consensus for the benefit of the country. Where is the leadership in the KMT and the DPP? she asked. Taiwan is struggling to gain US support for membership in the TPP, which could be of enormous benefit to Taiwans economy.',\n",
       " 'Plain packaging spreads despite the smokescreens Nick Miller 22 March 2015 Sun Herald Australias plain packaging laws for cigarettes have started a fire spreading across the developed world, writes Nick Miller. Its a bit stunning ... dominos falling everywhere. Mike Daube, mildmannered health policy professor from Western Australia, is surveying the virtual battlefield in the war against big tobacco. And he likes what he sees. It really is the most dramatic global development in tobacco control that I can remember in more than 40 . This month alone saw Ireland and Britain legislate for plain cigarette packets with big ugly health warnings, following Australias 2012 lead. Norway and France and others are hard on their heels. These wins have come despite fierce opposition from the tobacco industry. Lawyers have threatened huge lawsuits, piles of speciallycommissioned reports have been delivered to key lobbyists, legislators and opinionmakers, and the industry even (Daubes colleagues claim) played dirty tricks along the way. I havent seen the industry as ferocious about anything in more than 40 , says Prof Daube. They clearly do see it as a massive threat, especially now that so many dominos are falling. Also this week, billionaire philanthropists Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates dug for small change in the sofa and found $US4 million to help developing countries fight legal threats from tobacco companies. The fund was launched (and Prof Daube was speaking) from Abu Dhabi, where the 16th World Conference on Tobacco has the air of a war room, midcampaign. There were rousing speeches. Talk of tactics and strategies and alliances. War stories were shared and heads put together to try to read the mind of the enemy. Dr Douglas Bettcher, director of prevention of noncommunicable diseases at the WHO, was there. He agrees tobacco control measures are being adopted at an extraordinary pace. Two and a half weeks ago Ireland passed plain packaging legislation, last week similar legislation passed the UK House of Commons and Singapore announced a public consultation on plain packaging. This week the House of Lords passed it into law in the UK, Norway released a public consultation document proposing it and plain packaging bills are under discussion in Panama and South Africa, Dr Bettcher says. This is not to mention moves in France, New Zealand, Burkina Faso and Turkey. All of this progress is being made despite the industrys best efforts to thwart it, he says. Given that the industry fights hardest against the most effective tobacco control measures, it must be very worried about what the globalisation of plain packaging could do, and it is very busy concocting false evidence and lobbying hard against it. This is an  moment in the history of tobacco control. We are witnessing the creation of a global movement. A keynote presenter in Abu Dhabi was Dr James Reilly, a mellifluous Irishman with a flair for the dramatic. He sounds like a victorious general back from the front. This month Ireland became the second country in the world and the first in Europe to enact plain packaging legislation. Reilly shepherded the law through, as Minister for Children. This has been a long journey, he says. He called for a round of applause for Australia for paving the way and inspiring their decision to follow however, he says, there were far more twists and turns than we ever anticipated. To start with, European law did not permit plain packaging. Ireland had to use its 2013 presidency of the EU to push new laws through. But when the directive made its way to the European Parliament we saw the full power and influence of the tobacco industry at work, Reilly says. Documents leaked to The Observer newspaper showed 161 lobbyists were hired by just one tobacco company. Philip Morris International strategised to delay the directive until the EU presidency passed to tobaccofriendly Lithuania. In one  lobbyists claimed almost 1.24 million in expenses for meetings with MEPs, The Observer reported. They held personal meetings with a third of all the huge parliaments members, some up to five times. They targeted farmers organisations, retail bodies and trade and business organisations. Members of the EU parliament complained that the scale of lobbying on this directive was unprecedented, Reilly says. There was a very real danger that the parliament would vote in favour of reducing the size of warnings. The Irish prevailed in Brussels. The focus switched back home and the tobacco industry followed. They enlisted members of the EU parliament, US congressmen, Indonesian farmers and Irish retailers to their cause. We were lobbied on a scale that Irish politics had never seen before, Reilly says. Benson and Hedges owner JTI Ireland (a 55billioneuro multinational based in Geneva) warned in the last desperate week before the bill went to parliament, that the government had just days to withdraw or face a High Court claim for hefty damages. [Their] letter was especially aggressive, says Reilly. Not only did they attempt to tell a sovereign government that we did not have the authority ... they attempted to tell us how far we could progress it through our parliament and insisted that we provide them with a written undertaking within a matter of days not to progress it any further. Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris echoed the threats. But we had built a strong coalition that proved impenetrable, Reilly says. As a doctor he had seen firsthand the devastation caused by lung cancer. He told his stories to his colleagues. Not one member of parliament voted against the law, he says. [Big tobaccos] only aim is to protect their profits. Our aim and our duty is to protect the health of our people especially that of our children. We have the truth on our side and truth, as an old lady once told me, is not fragile, will not break. Nor will we. Cigarette companies including BTI are now considering their legal options, Fairfax was told. Then it was the UKs turn. Prime minister David Cameron had once been a plain packaging fan but by 2013 the plan sat in the coldest corner of the backburner after his Australian strategistforhire Lynton Crosby reportedly told him to scrape the barnacles off the boat in preparation for the 2015 election. Crosby, who also consults for Philip Morris, denied that he had ever discussed plain packaging with the PM. But for whatever reason, it seemed dead. But then up popped the policy again, suddenly, amid the dying embers of the final legislative sitting. Fairfax understands the governments hand was forced by a strong push for a private members bill in the House of Lords. Again, the tobacco companies campaigned strongly. Media were heavily briefed against plain packaging, as were MPs. Opinion columns rehearsed the tobacco lobbys song sheet (to be fair, by now the antitobacco lobbys arguments were just as wellpractised). The law passed, despite a sizable rebellion among MPs (and many who had to abstain, citing conflicts of interest or revealing previous tobacco lobby gifts such as tickets to the Chelsea Flower Show). A spokesperson for British American Tobacco told Fairfax there will be legal action. This legislation is a case of the UK Government taking property from a UK business without paying for it. That is illegal under both UK and European law. The UK Government has left us with no other choice ... Any business that has property taken away from it by the state would inevitably want to challenge and seek compensation. You could call it The Castle argument. As Darryl Kerrigan might put it, a cigarette packet is more than just a drawing on a box. By removing a companys right to use their own brand, you are stealing something from them. The tobacco lobby has other arguments but this is the core of their fight: not to lose their identity. Unlike in The Castle, this line failed in Australias High Court. But it is now being fought in two international jurisdictions including the WTO, on the basis that the laws breach Australias treaty obligations. And it will be fought again against the UK and possibly Ireland. And now it is Norways turn to enter the fray. This week, in a restaurant on a scenic hill overlooking Oslo, Norways health minister lunched with the local secretarygeneral of the Norwegian Cancer Society, Anne Lise Ryel, on the day of the launch of a consultation paper on plain packaging which also proposed new transparency rules on tobacco industry lobbying. There was another guest at the table: Nicola Roxon, Australias former health minister and attorneygeneral, the politician who used her two key roles in the former Labour government to formulate and then enact the laws that set a precedent for the world. Roxon is out of politics but finds herself in demand globally for her experience in the fight for plain packaging. We were looking to Australia to see what happened and to learn, Ryel tells Fairfax. They have seen dirty tricks already: in a previous legal fight against Philip Morris the tobacco companies spread their money around Oslos law firms, leaving them unable to advise the government. Bent Hoie, Norways health minister, tells Fairfax that Australia should be commended for leading the way. That has been very  for us, we have a complete example to follow. We can use their experience and be better prepared for what kind of resistance we will meet. Ms Roxon says she is proud and Australia should be proud of what it has achieved and what might yet be achieved following Australias lead. Im really pleased to be able to share our experience and hope that other countries will be able to avoid some of the problems, she says. She says the Norwegians are superorganised and supercommitted but have been picking her brains on the tobacco industrys likely response, especially how they brought employer and business lobbies into the argument. It may sound like big tobacco is losing an existential battle. But not so fast. Last  the world smoked more than 5.8 trillion cigarettes. The number was comparable to the  before, in which tobacco industry profits were more than $US44 billion according to Tobacco Atlas. Barely a 10th of the worlds population lives in countries with bans on tobacco advertising. Low and middleincome countries now account for more than 80 per cent of tobacco users and tobaccorelated deaths. The reduction in smoking rates in countries such as Britain, Australia and Brazil was more than offset by growing consumption in China alone. While developed markets are the source of current profits, developing markets are the drivers of future profits, a BAT spokesperson tells Fairfax. So why bother with Norway, when youve got China? Ryel says she believes her country, and others, are setting an example, and providing a template that others can follow. Thats why its so  that we help the other countries, to see the force we put the other way. What happens in Norway, we think and hope is helpful for other countries that want to go on board, they will feel more secure. If this idea catches on, it could snuff out tobacco on a global scale.',\n",

       " 'New Zealand Spied on WTO Director Candidates By Ryan Gallagher The Intercept 22 March 2015 New Zealand launched a covert surveillance operation targeting candidates vying to be director general of the World Trade Organization, a topsecret document reveals. In the period leading up to the May 2013 appointment, the country’s electronic eavesdropping agency programmed an Internet spying system to intercept emails about a list of highprofile candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, and South Korea. New Zealand’s trade minister Tim Groser was one of nine candidates in contention for the position at the WTO, a powerful international organization based in Geneva, Switzerland that negotiates trade agreements between nations. The surveillance operation, carried out by Government Communications Security Bureau, or GCSB, appears to have been part of a secret effort to help Groser win the job. Groser ultimately failed to get the position. A topsecret document obtained by The Intercept and the New Zealand Herald reveals how GCSB used the XKEYSCORE Internet surveillance system to collect communications about the WTO director general candidates. XKEYSCORE is run by the National Security Agency and is used to analyze billions of emails, Internet browsing sessions and online chats that are vacuumed up from about 150 different locations worldwide. GCSB has gained access to XKEYSCORE because New Zealand is a member of the Five Eyes surveillance alliance alongside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The WTO spying document shows how the New Zealand agency created an XKEYSCORE targeting “fingerprint,” a combination of names and keywords used to extract particular information from the vast quantities of emails and other communications accessible through the system. The document reveals that a fingerprint was specially tailored to monitor the WTO candidates and was “used to sort traffic by priority,” looking for “keywords [as they] appear in the email_body.” It is stamped with a “last modified” date of 6 May 2013, about a week before the new director general was to be announced. Two different intelligence searches were carried out by the GCSB staff as part of what they termed the “WTO Project.” First, they looked for emails referring to Groser, the WTO, the director general candidacy, and the surnames of the other candidates: Alan John Kwadwo Kyerematen (Ghana); Amina Mohamed (Kenya); Anabel González (Costa Rica); Herminio Blanco (Mexico); Mari Elka Pangestu (Indonesia); Taeho Bark (South Korea); Ahmad Thougan Hindawi (Jordan); and Roberto Carvalho de Azevêdo (Brazil). Second, they zeroed in on the Indonesian candidate, Pangestu, that country’s former minister of trade and a professional economist. A separate XKEYSCORE fingerprint was created, headed “WTO DG Candidacy issues – focus on Indonesian candidate.” This was presumably because the New Zealand government was particularly concerned that the job might go to another Pacific candidate ahead of Groser. The surveillance of Pangestu appears to have targeted all Internet communications (not just email) containing the name “Pangestu,” the words “Indonesia,” “WTO” and “candidacy,” and the other candidates’ names. The searches had keyword instructions in English, French and Spanish – for instance “zealand”, “zelande” and “zelandia” – in order to catch communications from more countries. The intercepted messages were to be passed to the GCSB’s “trade team,” which would likely have had the job of collating intelligence for people in government involved in Groser’s bid for the WTO role. The Intercept and the New Zealand Herald attempted to contact each of the named targets prior to publication. Several were not reachable or did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the WTO had not responded to multiple requests for comment at time of publication (update below). Bark, the South Korean candidate,  he had no inkling that he was the focus of surveillance during his bid for the director general role. He told the New Zealand Herald he had received no intelligence agency support as part of his own campaign. “It’s a different world for very advanced countries,” he . Bark, now an academic at Seoul National University and South Korea’s ambassadoratlarge for international economy and trade, added that he was not “offended” by the spying because he didn’t think it had any impact on the outcome of his effort to get the WTO job. But he predicted others would be stung by the eavesdropping revelations. “The Indonesian candidate would be very upset,” he . International economic law expert Meredith Kolsky Lewis, who specializes in the WTO,  she was “a bit shocked” at the allegation New Zealand had spied on emails about the director general candidates. “I’m a little surprised that New Zealand used the surveillance power available to it for this purpose,” Lewis . “It’s possible those who ordered the surveillance wanted to know who other countries in the region supported.” Andrew Little, leader of New Zealand’s Labour Party, criticized the surveillance and described it as “completely out of order.” “It just seems outrageous,” Little . “I would have thought that [to be] a misuse of our security and intelligence agencies. It seems to me right outside the mandate of the GCSB. It’s nothing to do with security threats.” It was in late 2012 that Groser was nominated for the position at the WTO. The New Zealand trade minister launched a lobbying campaign as part of his candidacy bid, traveling to Europe, the United States, Africa, the Caribbean and around the Pacific Islands in an effort to win support from members of the WTO’s general council, which includes representatives from 160 countries. However, his campaign was unsuccessful. Brazil’s Azevêdo (pictured above) was appointed the WTO’s new director general on 14 May 2013. Three weeks earlier, when it had become clear that Groser was not going to make the final shortlist, New Zealand’s prime minister, John Key, expressed his disappointment. “At the end of the day it was always going to be a long shot – so he gave it his best go with the support of the government,” Key . What the public didn’t know was that this support had included deploying the GCSB to spy on communications about the competitors. At the time of the surveillance, prime minister Key was the minister in charge of the GCSB, raising the question of whether he knew about and personally sanctioned the electronic eavesdropping to help Groser. A spokesman for Key declined to answer any questions about the WTO spying and instead issued a boilerplate response. “New Zealand’s intelligence agencies have been, and continue to be, a significant contributor to our national security and the security of New Zealanders at home and abroad,” the spokesman . Groser, reached by New Zealand Herald reporters late Saturday,  the government wouldn’t discuss “such leaks” because he claimed they were “often wrong, [and] they are deliberately timed to try and create political damage.” Asked if he knew the GCSB was conducting surveillance for him, he : “I’ve got no comment to make whatsoever.” GCSB also declined to comment on any of the specific revelations. In a statement, the agency’s acting director, Una Jagose, : “The GCSB exists to protect New Zealand and New Zealanders. We have a foreign intelligence mandate. We don’t comment on speculation about matters that may or may not be operational. Everything we do is explicitly authorized and subject to independent oversight.” Last week, The Intercept revealed that GCSB used XKEYSCORE to target top government officials and an anticorruption campaigner in the Solomon Islands. Earlier disclosures, which were based on documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, have exposed how New Zealand is funneling data into XKEYSCORE from a surveillance base in the Waihopai Valley and is spying on about 20 countries across the world, predominantly in the AsiaPacific region, among them small Pacific islands and major trading partners including Japan, Vietnam, and China. The Intercept is reporting details about New Zealand’s surveillance operations in collaboration with the New Zealand Herald, the Herald on Sunday, and the Sunday StarTimes. Update, March 22, 2015 at 17:30 ET: Reached by phone Sunday, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told The Intercept he was “learning about this for the very first time” and  he would not comment on the New Zealand spying until he had looked closer at the details. “Tomorrow morning I’ll go into the office and we’ll discuss it and we’ll try to figure out what’s going on,” he .',\n",
       " 'NZ spies monitored Groser rivals David Fisher 23 March 2015 The New Zealand Herald Exclusive Secret document reveals Five Eyes software used for surveillance on candidates for WTO job Our spies monitored email and internet traffic about international diplomats vying for the job of director general of the World Trade Organisation — a job for which National Government Trade Minister Tim Groser was competing. The spying operation was active in 2013 and called the “WTO Project” by New Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), according to a top secret document obtained by the Herald and United States news site The Intercept. The operation involved covert surveillance of candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico and South Korea. The GCSB tasking document which structured the search of internet traffic was designed to look for references to Mr Groser, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) role and his competitors, initially in any online communication but then narrowed to emails. Prime Minister John Key, who is in South Korea today with Mr Groser witnessing the signing of a Free Trade Agreement, refused to address the issue when approached for comment. His office issued exactly the same statement released since the Herald and The Intercept began reporting internal GCSB and NSA documents relating to New Zealand. In it, the Prime Minister’s office spoke of the GCSB’s contribution to national security, assured the public mass surveillance was not happening and that the agency operated legally. “The Government will not be responding to claims made from documents stolen by Edward Snowden.” Mr Groser  last night: “We do not comment on such leaks because they are often wrong, they are deliberately timed to try and create political damage and we do not comment on any of them.” Asked if he knew the GCSB was conducting surveillance for him, he : “I’ve got no comment to make whatsoever.” The documents show the WTO surveillance was carried out with the XKeyscore tool developed by the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) and used by the GCSB as part of the Five Eyes intelligence network, which includes New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. The surveillance operation was tailored to intercept electronic communications mentioning any of the candidates. It specifically instructed the search to seek out communications with the name “Grosser” or “Groser”. The GCSB also ran a specially targeted surveillance on the candidate from Indonesia, the country’s former Trade Minister Mari Pangestu. The South Korean candidate for the WTO directorgeneral’s job — Dr Taeho Bark — was among those targeted by the GCSB. Dr Bark, now an academic at Seoul National University and South Korea’s AmbassadoratLarge for International Economy and Trade,  he had no inkling any of the countries involved would have used electronic surveillance of the sort described. He  there was no assistance of the sort described to support his bid for the job. “I don’t have any kind of information through an intelligence organisation or bureau. It’s a different world for very advanced countries.” He  he was not offended because he believed it would not have changed the outcome of his failed bid for the role. International economic law expert Professor Meredith Lewis, who specialises in the WTO,  she was “quite shocked” and “a little surprised” at the allegation New Zealand had spied on candidates. Professor Lewis  she could not see what advantage Mr Groser would have gained. “The impression I got at the middle stage was that the candidates had their strong suits and weak suits you could identify without surveillance.’’ The GCSB’s acting director Una Jagose, in response to questions about the WTO operation, : “The GCSB exists to protect New Zealand and New Zealanders. ‘‘We have a foreign intelligence mandate. We don’t comment on speculation about matters that may or may not be operational. “Everything we do is explicitly authorised.” Labour leader Andrew Little was horrified on being told of the operation. “It just seems outrageous. I would have thought that a misuse of our security and intelligence agencies. ‘‘It seems to me right outside the mandate of the GCSB. It’s nothing to do with security threats.” Mr Little  it was an “unsavoury” way to campaign for an international position and it raised questions about how New Zealand had campaigned for other roles, including the UN Security Council. “That would be extremely disappointing,” he . The Green Party coleader Russel Norman  the revelation the GCSB was used to carry out surveillance on candidates for the WTO job would be “extremely damaging to New Zealand’s reputation”.',\n",
       " 'NZKorea FTA signed amid spying, lost sovereignty claims Pattrick Smellie 23 March 2015 BusinessDesk March 23 (BusinessDesk) A longawaited free trade agreement between New Zealand and South Korea has been signed in Seoul by Prime Minister John Key and the Korean president, Park Geunhye. The deal with New Zealand sixthlargest market for export products will make progressive inroads into the $229 million annual imposition of tariffs on New Zealand goods and services, mainly agricultural products, entering the South Korean market annually and had become urgent after competitors in the beef trade, Australia and Canada, had already signed such agreements. The signing in Seoul coincided with the release to the New Zealand Herald of documents showing New Zealand signals intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau, had in 2013 spied on efforts by South Korea to promote its Trade Minister, Taeho Bark, to become secretarygeneral of the World Trade Organisation, a position also sought by New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser. Both the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and antiFTA campaigner Jane Kelsey criticised the new agreement, saying it eroded New Zealand sovereignty through its inclusion of investorstate dispute settlement terms without achieving the same degree of market access as was achieved in the Australian and Canadian FTA with Korea. \"We need to ask why New Zealand is signing up to more ISDS provisions when we are fortunate to have relatively few of them. The answer may lie, once again, in the preoccupation with the agriculture parts of these deals without considering how real the gains are over how long and what trade offs are involved,\" Kelsey . Labour leader Andrew Little criticised the use of the GCSB to assist New Zealand WTO bid, but Labour had issued no statement on the FTA by time of publication. Estimated tariff reductions on a range of agricultural goods is estimated at $65 million in the first  of the agreement, which is expected to come into force this  following ratification by the New Zealand parliament. Twoway trade between New Zealand and South Korea is currently worth around $4 billion annually. The FTA contemplates a 15 phasein period, at which point 98 percent of goods from New Zealand are estimated to enter South Korea dutyfree.',\n",
       " \"U.S. Pushes Proposal on ECommerce, Data Security, Privacy in TISA Discussions By Bryce Baschuk BNA Reporter, March 23, 2015 March 20 — The U.S. reaffirmed its desire to adopt new international rules regarding ecommerce, data security and privacy at a March 18 meeting of the World Trade Organization Council for Trade in Services. The U.S. proposal, which was first submitted on Nov. 27, 2014, seeks specific commitments aimed at preventing its trading partners from engaging in forced technology transfer and forced localization practices to support their domestic technology sectors, according to a leaked copy of the proposal. The U.S.  at the March 18 meeting that the proposal was not a negotiating text and suggested that it should stimulate members' conversations about including ecommerce provisions in the text of a future Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). WTO members have thus far failed to forge an agreement on common rules regarding the treatment of crossborder data flows. Leaked Proposal The U.S. proposal seeks to prohibit each of the TISA 24 negotiating parties from forcing companies to maintain a commercial presence within its borders or to adhere to local content requirements as a condition for operating in the country. The proposal also stipulates that a TISA member shall not require technology service suppliers to transfer a particular technology or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory or to implement requirements that favor domestic services. Under the U.S. proposal, TISA members could not prevent technology service providers from “transferring, accessing, processing or storing information, including personal information, within or outside the party territory, where such activity is carried out in connection with the conduct of the service supplier business.” TISA members also would be prohibited from denying the “legal validity” of electronic signatures under the proposal. General Skepticism China accused the U.S. of imposing barriers to information flows and  that greater efforts need to be taken to balance national security interests with the terms of the proposal. The European Union  that national security should not be used to justify protectionist measures regarding electronic commerce.

India and South Africa expressed their general concerns about the inclusion of new services in the negotiations. Brazil  that it would oppose any restrictive language regarding the U.S. ecommerce proposal.

       " 'WTO Members to Resume Doha Discussions, Will Examine Dispute Settlement Decisions By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 23, 2015 March 20 — World Trade Organization members will resume intensive consultations this week to advance a work program that addresses the remaining issues of the 2001 Doha Round. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo will lead a series of discussions to resolve the myriad challenges that have prevented members from modernizing the WTO multilateral trade rules. Deep disagreements among key members, particularly in the realm of agricultural domestic support, have dogged recent efforts to agree to a detailed work program by July 31. The disagreement between China and the U.S. over agricultural subsidies is a key issue that needs to be resolved if members are to achieve any Doha goals by the Dec. 15–18 ministerial conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Dispute Settlement Inquiries The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) will consider granting panel inquiries into U.S. and Russian trade measures at its March 25 meeting. The European Union again asked the settlement body to establish a panel to examine Russian duties on imports of paper, palm oil and refrigerators, according to the agenda of the upcoming meeting. Korea also asked for a panel to study U.S. tariffs on steel products used for oil drilling, known as oil country tubular goods, the agenda . Though Russia and the U.S. rejected the initial requests for panel consultations at a March 10 special meeting of the DSB, the appointment of a panel may not be rejected a second time (47 WTO, 3/11/15). The DSB also will respond to a pair of joint requests from the EU, Japan and China for a decision regarding Chinese antidumping duties on highperformance stainless steel seamless tubes, according to the meeting agenda. Other Discussions WTO members March 23 will convene for a formal meeting of the development negotiation, while on March 24 the preparatory committee on trade facilitation will hold an informal meeting.

The US wants members to consider the \"efficacy\" of public stockholding programmes as food security tools and their effects on trade, including any unintended consequences that may distort trade or adversely impact the food security of other members. Based on the review of the public distribution policies, the US wants members to agree on a \"set of best practices for public stockholding policies\". Subsequently, a permanent solution will be finalized, the US has argued, in its proposals, reviewed by Mint. Responding to the US proposals, India maintained that the Bali mandate requires members to finalize \"a permanent solution for food security purposes but not on food security policies [of WTO member countries].\" The US proposal to discuss food security policies of other countries was already rejected by trade ministers when they framed the Bali mandate on what needs to be done to find a permanent solution, an India official has argued, according to people familiar with the exchange between the US and India at the meeting. Several nations, such as China, Indonesia and the Philippines, supported India, saying that the Bali mandate requires members to discuss the \"conditions\" for a permanent solution but not the food security policies of members. \"This is a classic tactic of stonewalling by the US to ensure that there is no permanent solution by the end of this ,\"  a South American agriculture negotiator, requesting anonymity. The Bali mandate, which was further modified last  after India and the US had reached an understanding, calls on WTO members to negotiate \"a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes\" by 31 December. Until conditions for a permanent solution are agreed upon and adopted, members shall not raise trade disputes against nations currently implementing public distribution system (PDS) programmes, according to the revised mandate. The G33 coalition led by Indonesia, and which includes China, India, the Philippines and 40 other developing and poor nations, has proposed three alternatives for a permanent solution. First, adding a new paragraph to the socalled government service programmes in the green box disciplines of the WTO agreement on agriculture, which are exempted from any subsidy reduction commitments. Second, modifying the existing rules to ensure that the acquisition of food stocks by developing countries to support lowincome, resourcepoor producers is not required to be calculated under the method used for calculating tradedistorting domestic subsidies. And third, modifying and amending the rules to calculate subsidies based on the socalled external reference period of 198688, which was decided during the previous Uruguay round (UR) of trade talks. The Doha talks were launched in 2001 to reform the rules in the WTO agriculture agreement negotiated during the UR. The UR rules for agriculture were largely decided by the US and the European Union (EU). Public stockholding programmes for food security were included in the Doha negotiating mandate for rectifying the UR disciplines. The revised draft 2008 modalities on public stockholding prepared by the former chair for Doha agriculture negotiations, Crawford Falconer of New Zealand, had clearly stipulated \"that there is no requirement for difference between the acquisition price and the external reference price to be accounted for in the AMS [aggregate measurement of support or tradedistorting subsidies].\" The EU ruled last week that it will not agree to including PDS programmes in the green box, or to the other alternatives proposed by the G33, on the grounds that they are not acceptable. The EU wants the G33 to come with new proposals, but is not willing to discuss what the group had proposed last . The latest standoff needs urgent resolution. \"The food security issue has come to a flashpoint and needs urgent resolution,\" the South American official argued. In an attempt to find a solution on a priority basis, the G33 has called on the chair for Doha agriculture negotiations, ambassador John Adank, to nominate a \"Friend of the Chair\" to facilitate negotiations for formulating a \"balanced\" permanent solution for public stockholding programmes for food security.',\n",
       " 'Indonesia plans levy of $50/T on crude palm exports instead of tax threshold cut By Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, March 21 (Reuters) Indonesia will impose a levy of $50 a tonne on exports of crude palm oil when prices fall below a threshold triggering a monthly tax on shipments overseas, the chief economics minister . When prices of crude palm oil fall below the threshold of $750 a tonne on average, the world top producer of the tropical oil cuts the monthly tax on its CPO exports to zero. Benchmark Malaysian palm oil futures have fallen more than a fifth over the last , and ended on Friday at 2,160 ringgit ($579) per tonne. Southeast Asia biggest economy set its crude palm oil export tax for March at zero, unchanged since October last . Indonesian officials are preparing new rules for a charge of $50 on every tonne of CPO shipped at the zero export tax rate, Sofyan Djalil told reporters, with the funds going to help pay for biodiesel subsidies announced in recent weeks. \"At any (CPO) price we will take $50 a tonne,\" Sofyan Djalil  late on Friday, making clear that when the CPO export tax kicked in, the government would allocate $50 a tonne to its biodiesel fund from the revenue earned. The measure will go to Indonesian President Joko Widodo for approval on his March 30 return from overseas trips. Indonesia ramped up biodiesel subsidies last month, in a bid to protect its biofuels industry against lower prices of crude and cut costly imports of diesel. But a subsequent decision to boost the minimum bio content in diesel fuel to 15 percent from 10 percent increased the amount of funds needed to pay the subsidies for the higher volumes of biodiesel. To secure processing supplies, Djalil  the government may also require CPO producers to allocate 15 percent of total output for domestic use, but gave no further details. A major industry group this week  the government was looking to lower the threshold for the monthly export tax, to between $500 and $600 a tonne. The CPO export tax, aimed to help processing industries and secure domestic supplies, rises to a maximum of 22.5 percent, depending on how far above $750 average prices climb. Before the recent changes, Indonesia CPO production was seen rising 7 percent to 31.5 million tonnes, with exports falling 500,000 tonnes to 19.5 million, industry estimates show. Major palm oil firms operating in Indonesia include PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology, Malaysia Sime Darby and Singaporebased Wilmar International Ltd .

       " 'Local poultry chief says US asking SA to shrink its economy 23 March 2015 The Mercury A PROPOSAL from the US poultry industry aimed at resolving the ongoing impasse over their poultry imports into South Africa is tantamount to asking the country to shrink its economy, according to the South African Poultry Association (Sapa). Sapa chief executive Kevin Lovell  the industry body would shortly be responding to the latest offer by its US counterpart, the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council (Usapeec), as the two wrestle with how to resolve a trade dispute that threatens to end South Africa participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) trade scheme. Lovell  the industry body would also be repeating its invitation to continue discussions with Usapeec and the National Chicken Council of the US in South Africa. He dismissed claims that Sapa was holding up efforts to resolve the trade dispute. \"As the duties are lawfully in place the best solution for the dispute is that the two industries find some reasonable compromise,\"  Lovell. \"We have been twice to the USA, they have yet to come here, and it is time for some sunshine discussions.\" According to Lovell, the current US offer would remove the equivalent of the thirdlargest producer from the South African market. \"That is both unreasonable and unacceptable,\" he told Business Report. Timelines He  Sapa had tried to get a clear understanding of the timelines involved in order to work within the requisite schedule to try to reach a resolution, but no one had been able to be very specific. \"We have explained to our counterparts that the sooner they can be reasonable the sooner we can agree to a concession for once we have agreed and reduced our agreement to writing we will have to make an application to the International Trade Administration Commission (Itac) to put our agreement into effect,\"  Lovell. He  the parties could not privately bypass a lawful trade instrument that was in place and Itac needed to allow interested parties to comment on what the two industries might find acceptable. \"Where the two industries differ widely is that the US industry seems to care little for our market realities,\"  Lovell, adding that principal among these was that the South African poultry industry could not increase exports to the US because of sanitary and phytosanitary issues, and whose basis, he , was \"spurious\". \"So an increase in imports means a reduction in local production,\" he , adding that the prime dispute was about an unfair trade corrective instrument the antidumping duty. \"For as long as the Americans dump we will defend our right to be protected from unfair trade. \"We are prepared to be harmed for the greater good of South Africa, but there are limits to the level of harm we can countenance,\"  Lovell. \"The Americans wish the world to believe that in the process of cutting up a whole chicken the cost (per kg) of some of the parts increase (breast meat) and others decrease (dark meat). That is clearly not logical.\" He denied that US poultry imports were shut off from the South Africa market. \"The antidumping duties apply to only one tariff line, so the rest of the poultry import market (about 250 000 tons per annum) is freely available to them and the part for which the antidumping duties apply (about 150 000 tons) is also available as the principle of an antidumping duty is that it is corrective, not punitive, ie it levels the playing field so that the two parties can compete equally and fairly.\" Lovell  the US government had not contested the validity of the South African duties at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The rule of law, he , allowed that these duties be considered lawful until shown otherwise. \"Their real problem is that the US poultry industry is not a real exporter but rather a surplus disposer removing surpluses their own people do not want to eat and finding poorer people in the developing world who are attracted to the unnaturally low prices of these products,\" Lovell . He  the US approach thus far was akin to asking South Africa to make a choice \"as to how we would like to shrink our economy chicken or cars\". \"Are jobs in agriculture worth less than jobs in the motor industry?\" Lovell asked. \"One should not forget that we traded with the US before Agoa and we will still be trading with the US after Agoa ends whenever that might be. Since Agoa is a unilateral agreement they can cancel it at any time which is not very good for longterm investment planning,\" he . Ellis Mnyandu',\n",
       " '\\'Economic emergence\\': the potential of fair African development Joris FIORITI 22 March 2015 Agence France Presse Across Africa, where many nations show high economic growth rates but with little benefit to their populations, the notion of social and economic \"emergence\" is taking hold as a remedy for perennial pessimism. The term has become a buzzword among international donors and African politicians who take it to mean a fairer distribution of wealth and other measures that benefit society at large. About 30 countries on the continent have signed up to the doctrine, according to the United Nations. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who hosted a regional conference on the theme this week, has grabbed on to the promise of economic emergence as he plans to seek reelection in October. Emergence, modelled on the success of the \"baby tigers\" of Asia Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam as well as Brazil, Chile and Colombia in South America, is presented as the opposite of a capitalist and dehumanised economic vision. \"For me, the goal of emergence is not GDP (gross domestic product) growth per se: it is the pursuit of greater human health and happiness so that each one of us can fulfil our potential and participate fully in our societies,\"  Helen Clark, administrator for the UN Development Programme. Ivory Coast, the world leading cocoa producer, barely four  ago came out of a political and military crisis after a bloody decade. It has since achieved an annual growth rate of 9.0 percent and is due to be an \"emerging\" economy by 2020, Ouattara told the conference, though the Ivorian opposition considers that goal farfetched. Leaders elsewhere in Africa are less ambitious but equally determined. Chad was aiming to emerge in 2020 but has revised the date to 2030, like Togo. More cautiously, Senegal rulers are looking to 2035 to attain key goals. \"In addition to being strong and sustainable, the growth that leads us to emerge should generate jobs, force down unemployment and reduce social inequalities,\" Senegalese President Macky Sall  during the forum. The UN Clark envisaged that \"by 2050, an \\'emergent Africa\\' would have tripled Africa share of global GDP, enabled 1.4 billion Africans to join the middle class, and reduced tenfold the number of people living in extreme poverty. These are exciting prospects.\" Investment in health and education and reducing inequalities between cities and the countryside and between men and women, along with diversifying the economy and appropriate infrastructure projects, are among means cited by experts to reach emergent targets. On a continent where 300 million inhabitants were considered middleclass citizens by the African Development Bank (ADB) in 2011, out of an overall population of around one billion, \"Afropessimism is now giving way to optimism,\" Ivory Coast Planning Minister Albert Toikeusse Mabri asserted. \"The African narrative has changed. Just a while ago, Africa was a place which was exceptional, but for negative reasons. It was a place where there was no growth, no law,\"  ADB vicepresident Steve KayizziMugerwa. \"People would say, \\'Yeah, that Africa\\', where there was war, quick death, no accountability,\" he , before adding how things have changed. \"We can no longer blame it on geography, we can no longer blame it on disease, we can no longer blame it on the colonial legacy, because many people have emerged,\" the ADB official , though conflict rages in Somalia and South Sudan and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Kenya and more recently, Ivory Coast, have sparked a more positive outlook on the continent, impressing the financial community with their success in development terms. \"Emergence is a bet on the future,\" declared UNDP regional director Abdoulaye Mar Dieye. The ideas discussed at the conference mean that \"economic growth without social benefits isn\\'t inevitable\",  Makhtar Diop, vicepresident of the World Bank for Africa, adding that the \"redistribution of wealth\" was vital for \"social wellbeing\". However, participants pointed out that emergent development is hampered by undue dependence on a single resource, like Nigeria and Angola which rely on their oil exports. Massive corruption and a lack of economic integration are also barriers to success. Capital flight costs Africa between 60 and 100 billion dollars a ,  Dieye of the UNDP. \"With good governance, you see what could be injected back into African economies.\"',\n",

The United States, worried about China growing diplomatic clout, has been urging countries to think twice about joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or AIIB, considered by some as a challenge to the World Bank and the Manilabased Asian Development Bank. Despite U.S. misgivings, Britain  earlier this month it would join the AIIB. France, Germany and Italy quickly followed.

The Journal reported that the U.S. Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, : \"The U.S. would welcome new multilateral institutions that strengthen the international financial architecture.\" He told the Journal that cofinancing projects with existing institutions like the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank would help ensure the new bank complements rather than competes with existing institutions. The U.S. Treasury Department had no immediate comment. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim  in a statement on Sunday that his institution was discussing with the AIIB \"how we can closely work together. We have every intention of sharing knowledge and coinvesting in projects throughout Asia.\" U.S. allies Japan, Australia and South Korea are still absent from the AIIB list of members.

       " 'Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew dies Jeremy Grant in Singapore 22 March 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Lee Kuan Yew Lee Kuan Yew, founding father of modern Singapore and one of the most influential global leaders of the 20th century, has died aged 91, half a century after he led the tiny Asian citystate to independence in 1965. Singapore first prime minister, Mr Lee ruled the island nation from 1959 for three decades, overseeing its transformation from tropical Southeast Asian backwater in the declining  of British colonial rule, into one of the most remarkable economic success stories of the 20th century. He combined an authoritarian streak and appetite for social engineering with a determination to cement Singapore status as the most businessfriendly location in the region by eliminating corruption and building a politically neutral jurisdiction based on the British legal system. That helped propel Singapore from an economically deprived port city of the 1950s with percapita gross domestic product of just $550 to an Asian financial powerhouse with GDP per capita of $55,000, according to the World Bank. On the international stage Mr Lee sharp intellect meant his advice was sought by US presidents from Lyndon B Johnson to Barack Obama, and by European leaders such as Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor with whom he remained close. He was one of the first to spot the potential of China under Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader whose promarket reforms unleashed the economic juggernaut that is now the world largest economy on purchasing parity terms. But it is as the architect of modern Singapore, an island with a population of a small mainland Chinese city, that he will be remembered. He led Singapore out of a shortlived union with the Malayan Federation in 1965, two  after breaking colonial ties with Britain. \"He will go down in history as the moderniser of Singapore and the leader who pulled it all together,\" says Michael Barr, associate professor at the School of International Studies at Australia Flinders University. Foreign investment has flooded into Singapore, much of it by multinationals such as Procter & Gamble, Caterpillar and Google, seeking to use the city as a regional headquarters for operations in the fastgrowing economies of surrounding Southeast Asia and, more recently, the wider Asia region itself. Singapore is the largest shipbunkering port in the world, the largest foreign exchange trading centre in Asia and is second only to Hong Kong in terms of wealth management by assets. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. < > The banning of the sale of chewing gum except for medicinal purposes was among the more benign examples of a rule that occasionally saw political opposition handled harshly, including the use of financially crippling lawsuits to silence critics. Mr Lee was often accused by rights groups of restricting civil liberties in Singapore multiracial society, over which he exerted a distinctive moral authority. But he justified his decisions in the interest of preserving the prosperity and safety of the majority of Singaporeans. He remained a staunch believer in caning as a punishment, the issue receiving global attention in 1994 when US teenager Michael Fay was caned under vandalism legislation in spite of appeals from then US president Bill Clinton. One of Mr Lee last public policy statements came in 2012 when he addressed Singapore falling birth rate by ordering citizens to \"have more babies\" making the top headline in The Straits Times, the main, governmentleaning newspaper. His last major public appearance came in November when, frail due to a neurological condition that hampered his mobility, he received a standing ovation at the 60th anniversary of the founding the People Action party, which he cofounded in 1954. Mr Lee death comes as Singapore is grappling with something of an existential crisis as sharply slower economic growth, a rapidly ageing population and social strains brought about by recent  of foreign worker immigration are posing challenges to the current government, headed by Mr Lee eldest son Lee Hsien Loong. Last  the economy Asia 10thlargest grew by only 2.9 per cent, a sharp drop from two decades of average growth of 6 per cent or more. It is forecast to grow by 2.8 per cent this , down from an earlier estimate of 3.1 per cent, according to a poll of private economists by the Monetary Authority of Singapore this month. The younger Mr Lee government has launched generous spending packages designed to bolster social safety nets amid widening social inequality. The PAP is braced for a tough general election either this  or in 2016 amid increasing support for opposition parties, which recorded their best results at the last poll in 2011. END',\n",

       " \"Muted Response From Officials Regarding New Zealand Monitoring WTO Candidates By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 24, 2016 March 23 — Reports that New Zealand monitored emails about candidates to lead the World Trade Organization did not come as a surprise to trade officials in Washington and Geneva, sources familiar with the WTO told Bloomberg BNA. In 2013 New Zealand government utilized the U.S. XKeyscore surveillance program to monitor Internet traffic and emails that contained information related to the selection of the WTO next directorgeneral, according to a leaked document published by the New Zealand Herald. It is generally understood that international governments monitor Web traffic for information related to trade negotiations, trade observers in Washington told Bloomberg BNA. “Most countries are in this game one way or another, despite claims to the contrary,”  Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. New Zealand delegation to the WTO did not respond to Bloomberg BNA request for comment and a WTO spokesman declined to comment. No Surprises The leaked document detailed efforts by New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) to monitor Web traffic for information, including references to nine candidates who were seeking to succeed former WTO DirectorGeneral Pascal Lamy. The nine candidates were: New Zealand Minister of Trade, Tim Grosner; Alan John Kwadwo Kyerematen of Ghana; Amina Mohamed of Kenya; Anabel Gonzalez of Costa Rica; Herminio Blanco of Mexico; Mari Elka Pangestu of Indonesia; Taeho Bark of South Korea; Ahmad Thougan Hindawi of Jordan; and Roberto Azevedo of Brazil. Azevedo was elected directorgeneral in May 2013. The document surfaced more than a  after National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden, released details of the “Five Eyes” electronic surveillance alliance of the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. Following the Snowden revelations, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed that the U.S. collects foreign intelligence to protect domestic interests and those of its international allies. “The intelligence Community efforts to understand economic systems and policies and monitor anomalous economic activities is critical to providing policy makers with the information they need to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of our national security,” Clapper  in a September 2013 statement. Last , a leaked 2013 document disclosed how Australia had monitored the email communications of Mayer Brown, a U.S. law firm that was representing Indonesia trade interests. The intelligence was shared with the NSA at a time when the U.S. was fighting an Indonesian WTO dispute over its ban on flavored cigarettes. Scant Impact Seen New Zealand 2013 monitoring efforts shouldn't have a detrimental impact on the current negotiations to conclude the 2001 Doha round or the TransPacific Partnership, trade officials told Bloomberg BNA. “I don't think it will have a major impact on the [Doha] round, or on any negotiations, for that matter,” Reinsch . “Most diplomats assume they're being spied on by somebody and act accordingly.” “I don't think this will have a significant or longterm impact on the negotiations,”  Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley Rein LLP. “New Zealand is not the only TPP country that has been accused of some combination of spying or leaking documents related to trade negotiations,” he . “I suspect the news will become a talking point for some,”  Scott Miller, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “On the other hand, I would not be surprised to learn that many governments conduct surveillance on negotiating partners all the time.”\",\n",
       " 'John Key hits back at Nicky Hager over GCSB claims 3News Tuesday 24 Mar 2015 5:10 a.m. Prime Minister John Key believes the latest spying allegations were timed to coincide with his visit to South Korea. \"Of course they were, it all part of a particular agenda by Nicky Hager and some others,\" he told reporters in Seoul. \"There no question there an antigovernment, antiAmerican agenda.\" The allegations that the GCSB snooped on Trade Minister Tim Groser competitors for the top job at the World Trade Organisation were published yesterday. They\\'re based on documents leaked by fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden and released by Hager, an investigative journalist. Mr Key says the South Korean leaders he met had no interest in the allegations, and didn\\'t raise them. \"They\\'re just not interested in Snowden,\" he . \"It just a 2012, backwardlooking antiAmerican bunch of plonkers that what these guys are, they\\'re not interested in the future of New Zealand or making it stronger, they\\'re just opposed to the government.\" Mr Key  Hager wasn\\'t a journalist. \"The guy a protester. Well, fair enough but just don\\'t take him too seriously. I don\\'t.\" Mr Key repeated the government stance that the GCSB operates within the law. \"We don\\'t have that many resources, and we have strong oversight,\" he .

       " 'WTO spy revelations uncomfortable at any time David Fisher New Zealand Herald 1:05 PM Tuesday Mar 24, 2015 Planned? Hardly. But that was the allegation from the Prime Minister today over the latest revelations about the activities of the GCSB. The Herald and The Intercept news site yesterday revealed a top secret GCSB tasking document which showed its powerful electronic surveillance equipment was used to sniff out emails which mentioned Trade Minister Tim Groser and his competitors for the top job at the World Trade Organisation. The news came the day John Key and Mr Groser signed a Free Trade Agreement in South Korea one of the eight countries to put forward candidates for the WTO job sought by Mr Groser. Mr Key would not discuss the facts of the story. But when asked if he thought the Herald WTO stories were timed to coincide with the signing, he : \"Of course they were, it all part of a particular agenda by Nicky Hager and some others.\" These are the facts. Some weeks ago, Hager and I met to discuss the broad sweep of the issues on which we would be writing. He had done the bridgebuilding with The Intercept and had been analysing material using the specialist knowledge for which he is held in high regard internationally. The first few stories were in sharp focus. We knew when they were going to run. The others were less clear and needed more work. It was only as weeks passed that a date of publication for the WTO story became clear initially, last Wednesday. As we entered last week, Hager had a draft ready for Monday but there was more work to do. We were talking on the phone about running on the following Saturday or Monday when it was announced by Mr Key office he and Mr Groser were flying to South Korea on Sunday to sign the Free Trade Agreement. Hager had no idea of the trip to South Korea until I told him. Both of us were discomforted by the timing and talked about the possibility there would be allegations it was planned around the trip because the South Korean delegate was one of those competing against Mr Groser. Hager suggested holding until today or tomorrow, or even waiting a week or more. I argued against holding it because, almost exclusively, news runs when it is ready to run. Holding off on something unless a matter of life or death is as bad as planning to run it on a particular day for a particular objective. I consulted with the editor, explaining the dilemma. He could see the issue but was comfortable proceeding. News was news. It runs when it is ready. Hager contribution was done by Thursday. I worked through the weekend as did Gallagher to have the story ready for Monday. Of Mr Groser competitors, the South Korean candidate was the only one who commented. He was the only one able to be contacted directly as he now works at the University of Seoul and has a current telephone number and email address listed publicly. The others were approached through press offices or by email. The first spying stories were  to be timed to target the Government during the Northland byelection. Mr Key has alleged this latest story was timed to impact on the FTA with South Korea. Not the case. It also landed in a week during which he and Mr Groser are out of the country and unable to be questioned in Parliament. The story ran during a feverpitch of cricket excitement, the consequence being the story about the \"WTO Project\", as the GCSB called it, ran on page five of the newspaper instead of its otherwise likely front page treatment. With future stories, it is likely they will also arrive at an uncomfortable time but that is because of the facts in the story. These are uncomfortable issues at any time. NZ Herald',\n",

The Secretary of Commerce has already tied up more than 3,000 agreements with small, mediumsized and large companies on the foreign exchange requirements they expect for 2015, a key factor for the government to decide later whether to greenlight each import permit request known as the DJAI. DJAI import permits were at the heart of WTO appelate court ruling against the country, in a case brought by the United States, the European Union and Japan against national licensing rules that the international body has  have been used to unlawfully limit imports. This week, a report by the European Commission  that Argentina “requirement to fill out a sworn affidavit prior to any imports — a form known as the DJAI — for all imports remains a major challenge” to free trade. “(WTO) appellate body confirmed the previous panel ruling which had found Argentina administration of the DJAI breaches WTO law.” Argentina response, so far, has been ambivalent. While Domestic Trade Secretary Augusto Costa told the Herald that Argentina will obey WTO ruling, adding that he expected a proposal outlining how the country planned to fulfill all requirements to be filed soon, he has remained a staunch defender of DJAI import permits. Costa argument is that DJAI import permits are or can be made compatible with the requirements of the international trade watchdog. “This doesn't mean that we will eliminate the DJAI system,” Costa . “We are awaiting suggestions from the countries that denounced in order to elaborate a proposal that fits the possibilities of our economy.” The Argentine government has highlighted that imports have actually increased between 2008 and 2014 in Argentina, questioning the US, the EU and Japan for leading international complaints against developing countries in the WTO while their government still protect local production through a host of different policies. “The highest tariffs applied by Argentina amount to 35 percent, while the United States charges 131 percent to fruit importers and Japan 450 percent for rice bought outside the country,” the government .\",\n",
       " 'Turkey urged to shun Vestel bid to protect mobile phone sector * Vestel says facing surge in mobile phone imports to Turkey * EU, Taiwan say no such surge, complain of protectionism * WTO allows safeguard tariffs under strict conditions By Tom Miles GENEVA, March 23 (Reuters) The European Union and Taiwan have  a bid by Turkish appliance manufacturer Vestel to get Ankara to impose emergency import tariffs on mobile phones would probably be illegal if it is approved, according to documents published on Monday. Turkey notified the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December that Vestel had sought \"safeguard\" tariffs to protect Turkish phone producers against a surge in imports. If Turkey accepts the request, it could effectively bar imported phones such as Apple iphone and Samsung Galaxy by making them prohibitively expensive. That would help Vestel, which launched a smartphone last September running Google Android operating system. Vestel, best known for its fridges, televisions and washing machines, has  it expects to sell 1 million mobile phones in the domestic market in 2015. Safeguard tariffs are allowed under WTO rules, subject to strict conditions. One condition is that a country considering their use must solicit opinions from interested parties, whose submissions Turkey published on Monday. In its submission, the 28nation EU  Vestel petition was \"very surprising\" because it had only just started making phones so it could not demonstrate it had suffered from a surge in imports and there had been no such surge in any case. \"It is almost impossible in this case to establish any kind of injury (to Turkey mobile phone sector),\"  the EU, which Turkey aspires to join. Taiwan  data submitted by Vestel showed the growth of imports had not been \"recent, sudden, sharp and significant\" as required by the WTO to justify safeguard tariffs. \"Such safeguard measures are completely unnecessary for protecting domestic industry and risk harming R&D investments and consumers\\' interests,\" Taiwan , adding that its own exports should be exempt from any tariffs due to its recognised status as a developing country. If Turkey does impose safeguard tariffs, it would take  for any legal challenge to work its way through the WTO system, giving Vestel young product a clear run at a protected market. Other submissions published by Turkey came from manufacturers ZTE Corporation, Samsung, Nokia , LG Electronics Inc and China Huawei Group, which argued that \"none of the conditions\" had been met for invoking safeguard tariffs.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Catfish Farmers Go After Asian Rival New rules jeopardize Vietnamese fish that in recent  has topped cod in U.S. sales By Tennille Tracy 24 March 2015 The Wall Street Journal A white flaky fish that recently overtook cod and crab to become the sixth most popular seafood in the U.S. could soon disappear from American dinner plates. Depending on whom you ask, the reason stems from either imported food safety concerns or a bureaucratic entanglement designed to protect the shrinking market share of Americanproduced catfish. The fish in question pangasius is produced in Southeast Asia, mostly in Vietnam, and often appears on restaurant menus as basa or swai. Pangasius lives in fresh water and has barbels or \"whiskers\" just like American catfish, which is a closely related cousin. Indeed, it used to be called catfish until Congress prohibited that labeling in 2002. Pangasius supplies could dry up as early as this  as the Agriculture Department assumes control over catfish and pangasius this spring a job currently done by the Food and Drug Administration. The USDA is expected to impose tough new standards on Vietnam and other countries that export pangasius to the U.S. There have been no major illnesses linked to pangasius in the U.S., or at least not any more than with other fish. But U.S. catfish farmers, who are mainly in Mississippi and a couple of other Southern states, pressed for tighter import standards. They say they fear a potential health scare related to pangasius would undermine the reputation of the catfish industry. Despite labeling laws, pangasius is often marketed and presented as catfish,  Dickie Stevens, chief executive of Consolidated Catfish Producers, a Mississippi company that sells fish under the Delta Pride and Country Select brands. \"There a lack of safety controls outside the U.S.,\" Mr. Stevens . \"The domestic catfish industry has been tarred with the same brush.\" Others see protectionism at work. The fight over catfish \"is not about food safety and never has been,\"  Lisa Weddig, a regulatory expert at the National Fisheries Institute, a trade group for the seafood industry. \"For , there has been an ongoing attempt to block imports and thus stifle competition. The foodsafety part of the equation is a charade.\" With a mild flavor and a moderate price tag, pangasius enjoyed a swift rise in popularity in the last decade. The amount of frozen fillets shipped to the U.S. soared to 215 million pounds in 2014, up from 7 million pounds in 2004, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The imports are now valued at more than $300 million a , according to the agency. In roughly that same time, U.S. farmraised catfish production fell by nearly 50% from 630 million pounds in 2004 to 340 million pounds in 2012, the latest  for which data are available. Data on the two species aren\\'t directly comparable because the pangasius numbers track the weight of frozen fillets while the catfish numbers count the weight of the whole fish. Pangasius, often raised in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, is shipped frozen to the U.S. and then offered in restaurants and grocery stores. Pangasius was the sixth most popular seafood in 2013, just behind pollock and tilapia, according to the most recent data from the National Fisheries Institute. The top three were shrimp, canned tuna and salmon. Seafood companies are bracing for a long supply disruption as Vietnam works to meet the new USDA rules for export approval. A pause in supplies could stifle the longterm growth of what has been a rising star in the seafood industry. \"A few [catfish] businesses in the South have a selfish and myopic viewpoint,\"  Bill DiMento, an executive with High Liner Foods, which makes fish sandwiches for the fastfood restaurants Burger King and Wendy. \"They don\\'t care to realize that thousands of jobs here in the U.S. rely mostly on imports.\" In 2008, Congress changed the foodsafety laws so that the Agriculture Department would oversee catfish and pangasius, instead of the FDA. The driving force behind the change was Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, one of the largest catfishproducing states in the U.S. Sen. Cochran office declined to comment. That handoff doesn\\'t become official until the USDA issues a final rule over how it will proceed with its inspection of catfish and pangasius, a move that is expected in April. Generally the USDA requires a country to set up a regulatory system similar to the U.S., a standard that could take  to meet, seafood companies . The FDA will continue to oversee all other seafood, such as shrimp and salmon. Vietnam isn\\'t ready to cede the business. The issue eventually could make its way to the World Trade Organization, where Vietnam could argue the U.S. is violating treaty obligations,  James Bacchus, a lawyer with Greenberg Traurig who has been hired by the Vietnamese Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers. \"A law is illegal if it has the effect of denying imported products an equal competitive opportunity in the domestic market,\" Mr. Bacchus . Many U.S. seafood companies, meanwhile, will have to comply with requirements from both the FDA and USDA, since the USDA will handle catfish and pangasius while the FDA oversees the rest. Even if pangasius supplies are blocked, domestic catfish will come under heavier regulation. The USDA is likely to require onsite inspectors in the U.S. and could ask seafood companies to set aside office space for the inspectors and be responsible for laundering their work clothes, among other new mandates. The Agriculture Department has estimated its inspection program will cost $14 million a . The Government Accountability Office  in February that the catfish program was an \"inefficient use of taxpayer funds.\" Kim Gorton, chief executive of the Bostonbased seafood company Slade Gorton,  she would consider eliminating catfish altogether to avoid the added regulation. \"It makes absolutely no sense,\" Ms. Gorton . \"My costs would go up so much, it would defeat the purpose.\"',\n",
       " 'China steel firms turn overseas as domestic woes mount * Crisishit steel sector wants govt backing as turns abroad * Looking to escape oversupply at home * Shift could offer some support to iron ore prices By Ruby Lian and David Stanway SHANGHAI, March 23 (Reuters) Laden with debt and struggling to make money as the world No.2 economy loses momentum, China steel mills do not appear obvious candidates for overseas expansion. But the country crisishit steel sector is calling for strong government backing for plans to ramp up foreign acquisitions, as it looks to escape weak demandgrowth and soaring environmental costs at home. In a draft of a revised restructuring plan for the industry issued late last week, Beijing included a line saying it would support mills\\' efforts to buy assets abroad, with attention now turning to more detailed measures that could be announced later in the . \"There is capacity that we can shift abroad, to regions that need it like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, as well as places like Indonesia and Africa where demand for steel is huge but production capacity is very low,\"  Deng Qilin, Chairman of Wuhan Iron and Steel Group, China No.4 producer. Foreign expansion by the world biggest steel sector would offer some support to prices of steelmaking ingredient iron ore <.IO62CNI=SI>, which plunged to record lows this month as Beijing ramps up environmental checks that could shut more mills in an industry where production capacity is 300 million tonnes above demand. The export market offered one of the few bright spots for Chinese producers last , but trade barriers erected amid accusations that China has been dumping products overseas mean exporting is becoming more difficult, with firms increasingly looking to shift actual output abroad. Beijing has already rolled out measures to broadly encourage the foreign expansion of Chinese industry including simplifying currency rules and making it easier to raise money through bond markets, with sectors such as nuclear at the forefront of the drive overseas. At this  full session of parliament, Wuhan Iron and Steel along with another major producer, Anshan Iron and Steel Group, urged the government to provide financial and policy support for the steel sector expansion abroad. China top steelmaking province of Hebei has also called for greater backing for its plan to move 20 million tonnes of capacity overseas by 2023. PLAYING AWAY Some are already making the leap, with Hebei Steel Group, China largest steelmaker, looking to build a 5milliontonneper steel project under a joint venture in Africa. Shougang, one of the largest mills, in February started production at a Malaysian project with an annual capacity of 3 million tonnes. A smaller company, Bazhou New Asia Metal Products Co. Ltd, bought a stake in an Indonesian firm in 2013 to build a steel strip project, with vicepresident Xing Xiuying saying it made the move as there was little room to expand in China. \"Investing abroad will help China to cut the excess capacity at home in the long run, as some companies will shift their focus to overseas markets and thus reduce output and competition domestically.\" Others have found moving more tricky, with the Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel both dropping plans to build plants in Brazil, blaming high costs. \"It will depend on how much capital is eventually engaged in helping Chinese firms go abroad, but generally speaking, the overseas expansion strategy will have a positive impact on Chinese steelmakers in seeking new growth,\"  Lawrence Lu, analyst at Standard & Poor Ratings Services in Hong Kong. Some were more sceptical, questioning whether there would be cost advantages to shifting output. \"The government should not use this as a main solution to ease domestic overcapacity as any blind push would bring consequences,\"  Jiang Feitao, policy researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences.

       " 'Philippines Bans Poultry Imports Coming From Idaho and Washington By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 24, 2016 March 23 — The Philippines banned the import of domesticated and wild birds and their products from Idaho and Washington, according to a recent notification to the World Trade Organization. The temporary ban stems from the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus serotype H5N2 found in backyard flock of geese, ducks, and chickens in Canyon County, Idaho and Clallam County, Washington. In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed findings of HPAI in guinea fowl in Winston, Ore., and in wild gyrfalcons in Washington (10 WTO, 1/15/15). HPAI has since been found in commercial turkey flocks in California, Minnesota, Missouri, and Arkansas, among other locations. Secretary of the Philippines Department of Agriculture Proceso Alcala  the country would immediately stop importing, and would confiscate all shipments of, poultry meat, dayold chicks, eggs and semen from Idaho and Washington. The Philippines joins a growing list of more than 30 countries, including China and Mexico, that have implemented bans on U.S. poultry meat originating from the affected areas.',\n",
       " 'EU and Turkey look to deepen trade ties Alex Barker in Brussels and Daniel Dombey in Istanbul Financial Times March 23, 2015 9:14 am Turkey and the EU are preparing to strengthen their twodecade old customs union, in an effort to deepen ties despite Ankara’s stalled membership negotiations and tensions over foreign fighters travelling through Turkish territory. Senior officials have agreed to explore extending the customs zone to areas such as services, agriculture and public procurement — a move Ankara long resisted by saying the trade deal should be superseded only by full EU membership. “We are openminded about these issues now — we weren’t before,”  one Turkish official. “Both sides are taking a more creative approach.” The initiative reflects thinking in Brussels and Ankara — but not necessarily all EU capitals — that the relationship between Turkey and the bloc is too  in economic and strategic terms to deteriorate further. “This is no panacea, the talks on a customs union will be hard, but this is an  first step,”  one EU official. EU membership talks, already troubled, have been further stricken in recent . There is resistance to Turkish accession in member states such as Germany and Austria, Ankara’s own interest in membership has declined, and the EU is alarmed by an alleged lurch towards authoritarianism under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s president. The faltering membership talks have largely framed TurkeyEU relations, making it difficult to strengthen ties in areas that have not been formally opened for negotiation. Since they began in 2005, 13 of 35 chapters — which range from company law to fundamental rights — have been opened for negotiations but only one has been provisionally closed. “You cannot make progress on accession because the political conditions are not met any more,”  Marc Pierini, a former EU ambassador to Turkey. “So you are trying other things\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009the only relatively innocuous thing is customs union.” However, the Turkish official denied the bid to deepen the customs union was an attempt to bypass the membership talks. “This is not a divergence from our goal of membership,” he . “On the contrary, it will actually help us get there.” When the customs union was struck in 1995, it was one of the EU’s most ambitious agreements with an outside country. But while its lifting of barriers on manufacturing trade has encouraged foreign investment into Turkish sectors such as the automotive and textile industries, the union does not cover the wider range of economic activities covered by more recent EU trade deals. Ankara is also concerned that if the EU and US succeed in talks to conclude a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, the customs union will give American manufactured goods backdoor access to the Turkish market without the US having to offer reciprocal access. Proponents of a broader customs union argue that an updated EUTurkish deal will eventually make it easier for Ankara to accede to TTIP. Yet even with fresh political impetus to start talks on a deeper customs union, membership negotiations are still likely to be difficult and drawnout. Formal talks are unlikely to begin before summer 2016 and the European Commission will need to prepare an impact assessment, which would probably take until the end of this . Subsequent approval for talks from EU member states may prove difficult given potential objections from Cyprus, which has no diplomatic relations with Turkey. Securing agreement on extending the customs deal will also prove politically fraught with Italy, France and Greece likely to be among those with deep concerns over removing customs restrictions on agricultural products. Adapting to EU requirements on public procurement and competition law would also be a deep and perhaps unwelcome challenge to Mr Erdogan. Such contentious issues have often been left towards the end of EU negotiations. The Turkish president has also increasingly employed antiwestern rhetoric, while western and Turkish officials have criticised each other for not doing more to stop foreign fighters from travelling through Turkey and crossing the porous border with Syria to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.',\n",

       " 'Waiting for the next \\'WTO moment\\' Zheng Yangpeng 24 March 2015 China DailyHong Kong Edition China decision to join global organization led to unimaginable changes within just one decade The historic significance of many events can only be appreciated in hindsight. In 2001, when China entered the World Trade Organization to a mix of praise and apprehension, even the most optimistic observers did not realize what it meant for the Chinese people and for people all over the world. In that , China foreign trade was a mere $500 billion. Last , it was $4.3 trillion, which made China the world largest merchandise trader. The flow of goods and services and capital, and changes in the value chain, transformed the country in just a decade, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty by putting them on the assembly line. There are many people to honor, among whom Long Yongtu is a legend. Long, former viceminister of foreign trade, was the chief negotiator for China accession into the WTO. Few now can imagine what headwinds he faced when he sought to integrate the country into the world economy. Last week, I attended a luncheon at which both Long and Wu Jianmin, former ambassador to France, were present. Wu recalled that in 1999, when Long, in a casual talk with United States trade officials, realized there was a chance to talk with the US about China joining the WTO, he excitedly knocked on the door of his superior, who gave him the cold shoulder. \"Yongtu, you are too politically naive. Don\\'t be fooled by Americans,\" the senior official . In a political culture that does not reward aggressiveness, Long could choose to stay calm and follow orders, and if that was the case China accession could be delayed. But that is not Long. He directly went to Zhu Rongji, then premier, a reformminded leader. Zhu reacted positively to Long idea, which made the ensuing talks possible. Long himself has long moved on from those memories. Still active in the public sphere, he would like to talk about China current economic conditions and champion further openingup. But what he did 15  ago will always define him. And it is precisely what he did then, that makes his argument now persuasive. At the luncheon, one of his top concerns was China talks with the US over a bilateral investment treaty. As many know, the drawing up of a \"negative list\" is at the center of the talks. A \"negative list\" specifies areas that are banned or restricted when it comes to foreign investors. These lists are also pivotal to China domestic experiment to set up free trade zones. Long admitted that there is immense pressure against shorter lists. That is not difficult to understand, because shorter lists would take power away from officials sitting in Beijing. But Long also acknowledged that \"without the BIT talks, the domestic \\'negative list\\' can never be really shortened\". He : \"Many domestic issues can only be solved under international pressure. That been proven over time.\" His simple words reverberated. After more than a decade of highspeed growth following the WTO accession, China growth engine cooled in the past three . Many domestic and foreign observers lament the lack of a new source of momentum, or what is called the \"reform dividend\". They long for a \"WTO moment\" or a \"1992 moment\", the latter being the  of late leader Deng Xiaoping southern tour that ushered in unprecedented entrepreneurial fervor. I have not had the chance to consult Long on what the next \"WTO moment\" might be. Is it a BIT with the US? Or domestic FTZs? But I am sure he would agree that openingup in China is never inevitable, as many may think. Unlike smaller countries that would not survive without integrating into the world market, China has a long history and a natural tendency to be introverted and selfindulgent. Further openingup requires a push that defies gravity by someone like Long. END',\n",

       " \"WTO Director Says Full TFA Ratification in 2015 Questionable By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 25, 2015 March 24 —It remains unclear whether enough World Trade Organization members will fully ratify the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) before the end of 2015, WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo . “I don't know,” Azevedo told Bloomberg in a March 24 interview. “It is tricky because each country has its own legislative procedures.” The TFA instructs members to improve their customs procedures and expedite the movement, release and clearance of goods, among other commitments. It is the WTO first multilateral accord in 20  and estimates indicate it could generate hundreds of billions of dollars in global trade efficiencies once fully implemented. The TFA will be ratified and enter into force once twothirds of the WTO 160 members submit their instruments of acceptance. To date, four WTO members have ratified the agreement: Mauritius, the U.S., Singapore and China. YearEnd Goal “It very early, most countries are still sending this to Congress and to their parliaments, where they have domestic procedures that they have to observe,” Azevedo . Though some WTO members—like the U.S.—are able to ratify the agreement via executive action, most WTO members must receive approval from their legislative branches or other various government entities before they can submit their instrument of acceptance to the WTO. Despite the lack of a binding timeline for TFA acceptance, Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Amina Mohamed urged WTO members to ratify the agreement by the WTO Dec. 1518 ministerial conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Mark Linscott, assistant U.S. Trade Representative for WTO and Multilateral Affairs,  he too expects full ratification before 2016 (43 WTO, 3/5/15). “I am making a call and asking members to try to accelerate and do things as quickly as they can, to see whether we can match the target,” Azevedo told Bloomberg. “But it unpredictable; it very difficult to tell.” Domestic Procedures Some key World Trade Organization members told the WTO that their governments are actively working to ratify the TFA with the hopes of accepting the agreement later this . During a March 24 meeting of the WTO Preparatory Committee on Trade Facilitation, delegates from the European Union, Chile, Nicaragua, Norway and Switzerland  they hope to ratify the agreement before the WTO Ministerial Conference in December.

At DSB’s March 10 session, EU’s request to summon a panel of arbiters was rejected by the Russian delegation which used its right stipulated by the procedure. Russia justified the move by the fact that this dispute may be settled by way of consultations. After March 10, negotiations did not resume, and EU has not expressed its interest in continuing talks.

       " 'India critical of US proposal on ecommerce, cloud computing D. Ravi Kanth 25 March 2015 Mint Geneva, March 25 India has expressed strong reservations about a \"prescriptive\" proposal submitted by the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to expand the work programme on ecommerce. The programme calls for framing trade rules for crossborder data flows, removing localization requirements for protecting personal data within national borders, and agreeing to proper coverage of cloud computing as part of computer and related services. More than three months ago, the US circulated a proposal seeking a robust work programme on ecommerce as one of its main priorities. \"Cloud computing is a critical component for any ecommerce and it is essential trade commitments reflect a high degree of openness for this service,\" the US had argued in its proposal. American companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) have the lion share in cloud computing. For some time now, the US has been working hard on binding legal rules for cloud computing, in which its companies have a major share. Last Wednesday, the US proposal on ecommerce came up for discussion at the WTO Council for Trade in Services (CTS). A US official argued that Washington wants to focus on \"traderelated issues of ecommerce\", including on issues of cloud computing and finding a balance between privacy and crossborder data flows. The US also maintained that its proposal is not designed to be included in the postBali work programme for immediate negotiations, according to officials familiar with the meeting. However, members delivered \"mixed\" responses to the US proposal. Several industrialized countries in the European Union, Canada and Australia, along with Mexico, Chile and South Korea, strongly supported the US proposal. In a sharp response, developing countries such as India, China, Brazil, Ecuador and Argentina expressed concerns over the underlying goals of the US proposal to expand the ecommerce agenda despite the lack of mandate from the members at this juncture. India  the US proposal was already rejected in 2011 and that its proposal is \"prescriptive\". \"We don\\'t want negotiations at this juncture,\" an India official , according to people familiar with the meeting. New Delhi maintained that it is interested in having a conceptual exploratory and experiencesharing dialogue without leading to any marketaccess negotiations. China  that while it would welcome the proposal on ecommerce from the US which recognizes the importance of crossborder flows, it is concerned that Washington had imposed severe restrictions on localization of services and data flows. Brazil agreed with India that there is a mismatch between what the US had proposed in its paper and what it is now claiming in its call for a dialogue. In the face of sharp divide, the chair of the CTS, ambassador Martin Eyjolfsson from Iceland,  he would hold more consultations to resolve the differences among members for pursuing the dialogue. Meanwhile, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Tuesday cautioned about \"asymmetric access to major market places and ecommerce platforms may accentuate existing imbalances in ecommerce trade\".

The step would help in boosting bilateral trade between the countries. \"Pakistan is in the process of offering India NDMA. Under NDMA Pakistan is expected to reduce its sensitive lists to 100 tariff lines,\" the Trade Policy Review report of the WTO . NDMA is a nomenclature chosen by Pakistan to avoid political ramifications at home of giving India MFN (Most Favoured Nation) status. India granted the MFN status to Pakistan in 1996 but Pakistan is yet to reciprocate to that. Grant of status to India would help in further boosting trade between the countries. Pakistan is postponing grant of NDMA status due to lack of consensus at home. In 2012, Pakistan had committed itself to give the MFN status but missed its own deadline of December 31, 2012 owing to domestic opposition. The neighbouring country has to abolish the negative list of 1,209 tradable items. Abolition of the negative list items that cannot be imported from India would mean grant of NDMA status to India.

       " \"World Trade Organization Beefs Up Dispute Settlement Body Attorney Roster By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 25, 2015 March 24 — The World Trade Organization hired eight new attorneys this week to assist with the growing backlog of dispute cases, according to WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo. The hiring spree aims to address recent WTO member complaints about the systemic lateness of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) reports (18 WTO, 1/28/15). In five of the last six WTO disputes, the Appellate Body has not circulated its reports within 90 days as mandated in Article 17.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). Members like the U.S. argue that such delays present financial difficulties for countries awaiting investigations of trade barriers that impact their industries' bottom lines. Dispute System Working Trade officials hail the DSB, which is tasked with reviewing the consistency of members' trade policies with their obligations under WTO rules, as an essential component of the organization work. Members have increasingly relied on the Dispute Settlement Body to resolve broad and increasingly complex trade cases like the sprawling dispute over Australia requirements for plain packaged tobacco products and the U.S. dispute with Mexico and Canada over meat labeling rules. The Dispute Settlement Body is already considering a high volume of complicated trade disputes in 2015 including a new investigations in the 10 feud over tax breaks for the U.S. and EU aerospace manufacturing industries. “The system is a being a victim of its own success; its just too many cases,” Azevedo told Bloomberg in a March 24 interview. “The bad news is that we have seen delays, the good news is that we can solve this. And this is happening because the system works.” More Time Needed “We don't have enough lawyers, and even if we have enough lawyers, we don't have enough appellate body members,” Azevedo . “It a limited number its just seven, and there is so much that they can humanly do together with the secretariat.” “So what we are trying to do now is we are trying to hire more lawyers, more people in the secretariat to help the panelists to help the appellate body,” he . “This is not something that can be done overnight,” Azevedo . “Even if I hire 100 lawyers today they are not ready to begin to deliver, actively working on the panels and leading a panel discussion overnight they need time to be trained.” “So we are hiring lawyers, we are getting more people on board. But it will take time to train people and to have them ready to lead the assistance to the panels, but we are working on that.”\",\n",
       " 'Trade no longer a Canadian ide practice\\'; Firmintegrated Donalee Moulton Financial Post 25 March 2015 National Post International trade was a topic that used to cause a great many lawyers to yawn. The area is starting to look a lot more interesting, especially as lawyers realize how deeply international trade law is embedded in other practices. \"Trade law has moved from being a side practice. It now very much integrated into other areas of the firm,\" says Peter Kirby, a partner with Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP in Montreal. Mr. Kirby is ranked as a Band 1 practitioner for International Trade/WTO in Chambers Global 2015. His firm is ranked at Band 3 in the category. The shift stems from globalization. As businesses operate around the world, the importance of trade laws, crossborder transfer of goods and services, and overseas investment becomes more critical. At the same time, governments globally are introducing new tradelinked legislation everything from money laundering to technology transfer to anticorruption. They are also signing international trade agreements that can restrict and broaden the business base. \"Canada has to comply with these treaties and implement them into domestic law. This is where the rubber hits the road,\" says John Boscariol, a partner in McCarthy TÃ©trault LLP Toronto Office. Mr. Boscariol is ranked as a Band 1 practitioner for International Trade/WTO in Chambers Global 2015. His firm is ranked at Band 2 in the category. There have been a lot of skid marks recently as governments, including Canada, scramble to put protections in place for companies in their jurisdictions and give their national economy a welcome boost. \"Now there is a spaghetti bowl of agreements,\" says Mr. Boscariol. \"The Canadian government has been on a tear negotiating these agreements as have other countries.\" The potential impact of trade agreements is significant. \"When the U.S. entered into a freetrade agreement with South Korea, we saw a marked drop in Canadian business with South Korea,\" says Greg Kanargelidis, practice group leader for Blake, Cassels Graydon LLP International Trade Group in Toronto. Mr. Kanargelidis is ranked as a Band 2 practitioner for International Trade/WTO in Chambers Global 2015. His firm is ranked at Band 3 in the category. Now Canada has signed a landmark agreement with South Korea. It the first free trade agreement in the AsiaPacific region and provides new access for Canadian businesses and workers to the world 15thlargest economy and the fourth largest in Asia. According to Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada, the CanadaKorea Free Trade Agreement will add $1.7 billion to the country economy and increase Canadian exports to South Korea by 32%. Two of the rapidly changing areas for trade lawyers are economic sanctions and trade controls, including with Ukraine and Russia. \"There is lots of instability around the world and that has resulted in these sanctions,\" Mr. Boscariol says. \"If you\\'re a company doing business abroad, this has become top of mind.\" Canada alone has identified more than 2,000 companies, individuals and organizations that companies cannot do business with anywhere in the world. If they knowingly or inadvertently do conduct commerce with any of these, penalties, potentially significant will apply. \"There is a heavy government footprint,\" says Clifford Sosnow, a partner with Fasken Martineau in Ottawa. Mr. Sosnow is ranked as a Band 1 practitioner for International Trade/WTO in Chambers Global 2015. \"When you are dealing with government rules, you need to step into the shoes of your client company and the regulator. Governments don\\'t tell you what the roadmap is.\" That direction comes from trade lawyers, and more and more frequently, it comes before an issue arises. The prevention mantra is being heard. Public issuers are already heavily invested in compliance, especially in the wake of international trade disputes that have cost millions. \"This is now filtering down to private companies and smaller companies,\" Mr. Kirby says. \"They\\'re beginning to see there is a value in having a compliance program. It a risk assessment, and that risk assessment is changing.\"',\n",
       " 'Australia weighs U.S., Europestyle tariffs on Chinese solar By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, March 25 (Reuters) Australia will decide within weeks whether to follow the United States and Europe by imposing tariffs on solar panels imported from China, after Australia only manufacturer accused Chinese rivals of selling below cost to steal its customers. After an 11month investigation into Chinese solar panel imports, the Australian AntiDumping Commission told Reuters it would publish preliminary findings on April 7, with a final recommendation on whether to impose the charges due on May 19. Chinese solar panels account for 80 percent of the panels in Australia, a business worth about A$500 million ($393 million) a  to Chinese manufacturers, according to Australia only solar panel manufacturer, Tindo Solar. The United States, Europe and Canada have in recent  imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panel imports, winning the support of manufacturers but angering China, major domestic retailers and installers which rely on cheap goods in large quantities to stay profitable. Selling goods overseas at a loss to take business from local suppliers, or \"dumping\", is legal according to the World Trade Organisation but authorities can charge tariffs if an industry can prove it has been damaged by the practice. Adelaidebased Tindo Solar  it hoped the commission recommended tariffs based on its claim that it had been forced to cut prices to compete with Chinese imports. \"It stunted our growth,\" Tindo Managing Director Adrian Ferraretto told Reuters. \"We are survivors, we\\'re tenacious, but our potential can\\'t be realised as quickly as it otherwise could be.\" The commission  in a Feb. 11 report of its meeting with one of four Chinese manufacturers it investigated, Zhejiangbased, New Yorklisted ReneSola Ltd, that the exporter was selling to Australia at a discount of 0.3 percent. The regulator only considers recommending antidumping tariffs if goods are being imported at more than 2 percent below cost price. In a submission to the investigation, Tindo accused ReneSola of providing incomplete data and  the United States, European Union and Canada had found evidence that the exporter was dumping with discounts of 78.42 percent to 9.14 percent. ReneSola Australian sales have grown from $3 million to $55 million from 2011 to 2013, according to its latest annual report. ReneSola Australia was not immediately available for comment.

       " 'Brazil reduces cooperation with Africa due to budget cuts, lack of interest 24 March 2015 BBC Monitoring Americas Text of report by leading, centreleft Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo website on 23 March [Report by Patricia Campos Mello: \"Brazil Retreats, Reduces Projects For Africa\".] Note: the translation below is machine based with limited editorial intervention. Sao Paulo The lack of resources and interest are starting to dismantle Brazil commercial and diplomatic offensive in Africa. After gaining ground and influence in the continent during the administration of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who opened 17 embassies and made numerous trips to African countries, Brazil is back tracking. The budget of the Brazilian government cooperation programmes in Africa has dropped by 25 per cent since 2012, and several projects have come to a standstill. The FGV [Getulio Vargas Foundation] had 60 projects in Africa three  ago and now it has two. Vale [Vale do Rio Doce mining company] closed mineral exploration activities in three African countries and sold part of the operations in Mozambique to Mitsui, late last . Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] returned five exploration blocks in the last two . And Brazilian exports to Africa (which reached a peak of USD 12.22 billion in 2011), closed 2014 at USD 9.70 billion, a 20 per cent decrease. During the same period, total exports from Brazil dropped by 12 per cent. The ProSavannah, one of the flagship projects, is idling. The partnership between Japan, Brazil, and Mozambique aims to develop agriculture in the Nacala corridor region (northern Mozambique), of similar characteristics to the Brazilian wasteland. For this, Embrapa [Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock Research Enterprise] would set up a soil laboratory and Japan another. The laboratory of the Japanese is ready. The Lichinga, worth USD 1.5 million that would be funded by Brazil, through ABC (Brazilian Cooperation Agency), is stopped due to the lack of funds, Folha found out. \"There is a decline in the foreign policy for the region, while Brazilian companies experience economic difficulties, with low commodity prices,\"  Adriana Abdenur, professor at PUCRJ [Pontifical Catholic University Rio de Janeiro]. \"China, India, and Turkey are gaining ground with Brazil retreat in the continent,\" she says. The execution of the ABC budget (the amount actually used) dropped by 25 per cent from 36.9 million reais [R] in 2012 to R27.8 million in 2014. The agency had 253 projects or activities in Africa in 2010. Last , they amounted to 161. \"All the projects are behind schedule and facing difficulties. Resources were not short only for the cotton area, which had money from the trade dispute with the US,\" a person involved with the project told Folha. \"The incumbent administration has no sensitivity towards foreign policy, let alone Africa. In the past there was no money for Africa because it was not a priority. Now, there is no money for Africa because there is no money,\" she  on the condition that she is not identified. ABC renegotiated with some countries, asking to share costs the projects in those countries that did not agree with the deal were cancelled. Now, the agency is focused on completing projects already started. Still, due to the lack of resources, some were abandoned half way. This is the case of the Senai [National Service for Municipal Aid] centre in Maputo (Mozambique) to train manpower. The equipment was purchased, but USD 3.5 million are missing to reform the area designated for the centre. \"There was considerable optimization of the resource used, reducing the average cost of the projects, although there have been adjustments in the number of activities in Africa in the past two ,\" says ABC Director General Fernando Abreu. On Friday (20), during lunch with African ambassadors in Brasilia, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira  that Brazil engagement in Africa is a \"state policy.\" But he admitted difficulties. \"Cyclical adjustments may have a momentary impact (...), but they do not alter our sense of priorities. Africa was, is, and continues to be an absolute priority of Brazilian foreign policy.\" Next week, Vieira will travel to Ghana, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, Angola and Mozambique. DECLINE OF DONATIONS Even humanitarian cooperation has been affected. In 2012, donations to Africa amounted to USD 65.2 million. In 2013, they dropped by 89 per cent, to USD 6.9 million. In 2014, they amounted to USD 11.9 million, but only because they included USD 9.6 million of extraordinary donation to fight Ebola (with a delay in the release of funds). The decline goes against the strategy \"Focus on Africa\" of Lula and his Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, that also served for Brazil ambition to play a greater global role. Brazil claimed a permanent seat in an expanded UN Security Council. Africa represents 50 votes. The government credits two achievements Roberto Azevedo election to chair the WTO and Jose Graziano for the FAO to this African expansion. Cleber Guarany, who has been working on projects in Africa for the past eight , believes that the withdrawal of the Brazilian foreign policy affects businesses, which are less willing to take risks today. According to him, the FGV has up to 60 projects in seven countries worth USD 3 billion, with the support of the Brazilian government. Today there are only two, in Mozambique and Angola, \"with the handbrake on.\" Source: Folha de Sao Paulo website (www.folha.com.br [http://www.folha.com.br]) in Portuguese 23 Mar 15',\n",
       " 'China to Set More FreeTrade Zones Program intended to help liberalize the financial sector but many companies say they see little benefit in pilot By William Kazer The Wall Street Journal March 24, 2015 8:13 a.m. ET BEIJING—China has formally approved plans to set up three more free trade zones in a trial program intended to pave the way for liberalization of the country’s financial sector. The Communist Party’s powerful Politburo approved the plan for the three zones in Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the south and the big northern municipality of Tianjin, the official Xinhua News Agency  on Tuesday. The three new zones will join their counterpart in Shanghai, which was opened with much fanfare in September 2013 but has so far failed to convince many foreign companies that it has ushered in an era of more liberalized investment rules. An annual survey of more than 370 members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai released this month found that almost threequarters of the respondents believed the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone offered no tangible benefits for their business. Around half  they hadn’t noticed any change. Chinese authorities rolled out what they called a “negative list” of investment guidelines—essentially allowing foreign companies to invest in any sector that doesn’t specifically bar them. But its list of negatives was so long that many foreign companies were disappointed. Chinese officials have  that the Shanghai free trade zone has simplified foreignexchange procedures and made it easier for companies operating in the zone to borrow funds offshore. It has also allowed Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. to offer videogame consoles in China for the first time in more than a decade. Officials maintain that more liberalization lies ahead as China moves gradually toward an easing of its foreign exchange control regime, which limits currency conversions. The Xinhua report didn’t give any fresh details on the regulations covering the three new zones. —Grace Zhu contributed to this article. END',\n",

This  the WTO 160 members began a process aimed at improving market access, eliminating export subsidies and reducing tradedistorting domestic support in line with the goals of the group Doha Development Agenda. Though the U.S. has taken part, it hasn't provided its representatives a clear mandate in the absence of Trade Promotion Authority, or fasttrack trade, legislation that would allow the executive to negotiate and give Congress an upordown vote on potential trade deals. “Trade promotion authority would certainly help in the later stage when we are finalizing the deal,” Roberto Azevedo  in an interview on March 24. WTO members resumed consultations this week to advance a work program for the remaining issues of the 2001 Doha Round. The talks' conclusion has been hampered by disagreements between developed and developing countries over the best ways to modernize multilateral trade rules. “My hope is that we can complete, by July, a very specific and detailed work program,” Azevedo . “Because the more specific we are, the better we are situated to conclude the negotiations.” Azevedo  the WTO work doesn't conflict with U.S. efforts to conclude regional trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans Pacific Partnership. “The WTO agreements are more rules and disciplines oriented, and the bilateral agreements and the regional agreements are more marketaccess oriented,” Azevedo . “Difficult to compare, so one doesn't diminish the importance of the other.

This comes a day after the accession protocol was ratified by the archipelago National Assembly. The signed document which Michel presented to WTO Director of the Accessions Division, Chiedu Osakwe, at State House, in the Seychelles capital of Victoria this morning, paves the way for the island nation to become a full member of the organisation in 30 days. A proud moment for Seychelles Hailing the final step to WTO accession as a proud moment for Seychelles, the Seychellois Head of State expressed confidence that the country can bring additional value to the organisation. \"Joining WTO ensures that we are not bystanders while global processes are shaped and directed by others,\" he . \"It ensures that we can create more opportunities for our people while also defending their right to development.\" \"As a Small Island Developing State we are reliant on open access to trade in goods and services both to ensure that the basic needs of our people are met, and to ensure that we continue to create opportunities for wealth creation and prosperity.\" Michel has called on the WTO secretariat to help build the capacity of the private sector, especially among small and medium businesses in the India Ocean island nation of 90,000 people. \"Our future success economically depends on our ability to innovate to build on our strengths and reduce our weaknesses,\" he . \"Our call to develop our Blue Economy is one such initiative which aims to transform our situation from price takers in the global economy to shapers of new models of development. And to develop the Blue Economy we will need to leverage the research and technological support from across the globe. WTO is well placed to facilitate this access to the key drivers of our Blue Economy transformation.\" Michel also highlighted the necessity to continue to link trade and development stressing that this will ensure that longterm investments are secure as long as there is more transparency in international trading rules. \"I am convinced that WTO accession opens up a new chapter for Seychelles\\' development. A new chapter whereby even though we know we are still vulnerable to external shocks we have many more tools with which to cope with these shocks. That we have many more tools to build other opportunities that ensure that our economies are fundamentally sustainable,\" he concluded his remarks. WTO membership is a commitment to reform 30 days from now, Seychelles will officially become the 161st member of the WTO. The accession process, which started almost 20  ago, came to a conclusion in December last , when WTO General Council meeting in Geneva, Switzerland approved the archipelago accession package, including the accession protocol. The Director of the organisation Accessions Division, Chiedu Osakwe, has described WTO membership as a commitment to reform. \"Accession to the WTO is a commitment to trade integration to the core values of the WTO which are the values of the market economy, transparency, good governance and the rule of law. This is what you have committed yourself to,\"  Osakwe, who spoke on behalf of the DirectorGeneral of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo. \"What you have done for your country, is not only what has been done for your country but what has been done for Africa and what has been done to update the rules of the multilateral trading system.\" Seychelles expected to participate fully in future WTO negotiations Upon becoming a full member of the WTO, Seychelles will be expected to become actively engaged in future negotiations. One of the events where the island nation will be able to make its very first contribution will be during the 10th WTO Ministerial Meeting. which will take place in Nairobi Kenya from December 15 to 18 this  the first time such a meeting will ever take place on African soil. Interviewed by SNA in December last , the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Chairperson, Marco Francis  the WTO membership had to be embraced and utilised to the business community in Seychelles\\' advantage. He highlighted the need for the Finance, Trade and Investment Ministry [now Finance, Trade and Blue Economy] to have targeted informative sessions for people in the private sector and businessmen to educate them on what is to be expected and what in it for them and how to use this for their own benefits. Currently, the WTO membership of 160 member states accounts for over 97 percent of the world total trade volume. While the process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant country it normally takes an average of about five  for most nations. Seychelles initially requested membership to the WTO on May 31, 1995, and made very little progress up until it reinitiated the process in 2008. One of the main challenges Seychelles faced was the limited expertise and experience within its national institutions in trade negotiations and in general and multilateral negotiations in particular. Since 2008, the government made a significant amount of progress to identify the required legislative changes. By 2010, Seychelles had submitted offers in both Goods and Services, and also established a Working Party on July 11, 1995. The island nation completed bilateral trade negotiations with nine WTO members that requested talks via Seychelles\\' working party, namely the US, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mauritius, Oman, South Africa, Switzerland and Thailand. Tourism and fisheries are the main pillars of the island nation economy, with the main export being canned tuna destined mainly for the European market. Seychelles also depends heavily on food imports with up to 90% of goods consumed coming by air and sea cargo. According to the Seychelles National Bureau of Statistics, the country exported goods worth just over $230 million in the first 9 months of 2014, including fish products, sea cucumbers and medical supplies while importing nearly $800 million of goods during that same period. According to provisional statistics compiled by the NBS the largest volume of imports to Seychelles in 2014 were from the UAE, followed by France, Spain, South Africa, United Kingdom, India, China, Mauritius and Singapore.',\n",
       " 'WTO quandary expected to end soon KUENSEL – National Daily News Paper 26 March, 2015 But first, look forward to a rehash of all the old pros and cons of joining the world body Trade: After sitting on it for more than a decade, the government is to soon give its decision on whether Bhutan will join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or not. The move is also in line with government’s pledge to explore the possibilities of joining WTO, and the economic affairs minister Norbu Wangchuk  the ministry would be making a presentation to the cabinet next month. Bhutan’s accession process started in 1999, when it was given observer status, and the first working party was formed the same . Bhutan almost acceded to WTO in 2009 but decided against it. The WTO quandary popped up again during a high level workshop on national competitiveness on March 23. The former trade minister of the Republic of Korea, Taeho Bark,  it was  for Bhutan to resume the WTO negotiations. “Accession to WTO is the key towards futuristic economic vision,” he . “It offers a chance to evaluate the overall trade system and improve it while getting technical support.” Although it comes with a cost, he , accession to WTO would facilitate trade in a landlocked country, with enhanced capacity for managing sound trade policy and legal tools. Some participants  joining WTO was a part of globalisation, which was inevitable, and that the benefits of economic integration would eventually compensate the costs incurred. The cost refers to the financial resource that the country needs to amend or abolish existing acts and regulations to make them coherent with WTO rules and agreements, and even to establish new institutions for that matter. Officiating economic affairs secretary Sonam P Wangdi  the accession process took time because the government didn’t want to act in haste. “An extensive debate would explore more benefits and adverse implications for the country,” he . Going by the studies conducted in the past, membership in the WTO would give Bhutan a stake on direction of international trade. The country can also reap the benefits from access to open market and ensure that Bhutanese goods are not discriminated in the market. Reducing the tariff and nontariff barriers is one of the impacts, which means that Bhutan gains by importing goods at competitive prices, and loses if its goods cannot compete with those of other members in the same market. Under the “most favoured nation” (MFN) principle of WTO, Bhutan will also be obliged to trade with China or any other country, as equally as it trades with India, with which Bhutan’s trade is about 90 percent. The MFN principle states that, if a country improves the benefits that it gives to one trading partner, it has to give the same “best” treatment to all other WTO members, so that they all remain “mostfavoured,” and this is where competition comes in. This again implies that the country can enjoy multilateral trade without having to sign trade agreement with each of the nations. But past studies have also pointed out that Bhutan’s advantage of joining the WTO is always accompanied by an equal number of factors resisting it. “It all depends on how intelligently Bhutan negotiates and the country’s economic preparedness,” states one such assessment.

       " 'WTO to Rule on Legality of U.S., EU and Russian Duties in 2016 By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 26, 2015 March 25 — The World Trade Organization investigation into certain U.S., EU and Russian trade measures is unlikely to be resolved until 2016, trade officials  following a meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The DSB agreed on March 25 to establish three separate panels to consider whether various U.S., EU and Russian duties comply with international trade obligations. Though Russia and the U.S. rejected initial requests for panel consultations at a March 10 special meeting of the DSB, the appointment of a panel could not be rejected a second time, per WTO rules. The WTO requires the DSB to issue a report within nine months of the panel establishment, though a backlog of cases before the body has caused significant delays. A WTO official told Bloomberg BNA that the average dispute process takes about a  and a half to complete. U.S. Steel Measures A DSB panel agreed to study U.S. tariffs on steel products used for oil drilling, known as oil country tubular goods (OCTG). The case stems from a 2014 International Trade Commission decision that dumped imports of OCTG from Korea, India, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam posed material injury to the U.S. steel industry. In response, the U.S. issued antidumping duties ranging from 9.89 percent to 15.75 percent on Korean producers and exporters such as AJU Besteel Co., Husteel Co., Hyundai HYSCO, ILJIN Steel Corp., Nexteel Co. and SeAH Steel Corp. Korea argued that the U.S. measures and the Commerce Department price calculations were inconsistent with the rules of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the AntiDumping Agreement(37 WTO, 2/25/15). The EU, India, Canada, China, Turkey and Russia have requested to reserve their thirdparty rights in the dispute. Russian Tariff Rates The DSB agreed to investigate the EU claim that the level of Russian duties on imports of paper, palm oil and refrigerators are higher than the levels to which Russia had agreed to when it joined the WTO in 2012. Russia applied a duty rate of 15 percent instead of 5 percent for paper products and, in the case of palm oil and refrigerators, it “fixes a minimum amount that needs to be paid even if not justified by the agreed duty rate expressed in a percentage of the product value,” the EU  (39 WTO, 2/27/15). The EU previously claimed that Russia duties have impacted European exports to the tune of $672 million per . Russia  that it was disappointed and believed that the matter could be better resolved through consultations. The dispute comes amid strained relations between the EU and Russia stemming from economic sanctions applied after Russia seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The following countries reserved their thirdparty rights in the dispute: Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, the U.S., Japan, Korea, Norway, Moldova, India and Ukraine. EU Plastics Dispute The DSB will also consider Pakistan dispute over EU countervailing duties on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) imports such as plastic food and beverage containers. The case stems from a 2010 EU decision to impose a 5.1 percent countervailing duty (CVD) rate on Pakistan imports of certain PET products. The EU  that Pakistan had implemented at least seven forms of domestic subsidies, favorable tax regimes and tariff protections that unfairly harmed the EU plastics industry. Pakistan argued that the EU unfairly characterized its domestic tax laws and implemented retaliatory measures in violation of the WTO Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement. In 2013, the EU agreed to reduce its CVD rate on Pakistani PET imports to 4.1 percent following a successful appeal from Pakistan sole PET exporter, Novatex Ltd., which claimed an accounting inaccuracy in the 2010 EU decision. The EU CVDs, which are scheduled to expire in September 2015, also targeted PET imports from Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

Following a meeting earlier on Wednesday, the WTO decided to establish an arbitration group to resolve the RussiaEU dispute. Russias representatives  that negotiating process was the most constructive way of reaching mutually acceptable decisions in the current situation. The delegation emphasized that in the event of arbitration, Russian representatives were ready to champion the interests of Moscow using all the tools permitted by the WTO. Russia joined the WTO in August 2012. Brussels has repeatedly accused Moscow of not meeting the commitments it undertook since becoming a WTO member. The European Union has filed at least four cases against Russia, its third largest trading partner, within WTO frameworks. For its part, Russia has initiated two cases with the WTO against the European Union. The first concerns EU antidumping measures for some Russian imports, while the second is over EU measures relating to the socalled Third Energy Package.',\n",
       " \"Challenges Weigh on Pakistan Economic Growth, Trading Status By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 26, 2015 March 25 — The World Trade Organization  that natural disasters, security challenges and other “economic adversities” have weighed on Pakistan ability to improve its trade policies in recent . Despite a 3.2 percent average increase in real GDP growth from 2011 to 2013, “serious challenges remain,” including power shortages, a weak fiscal position and lack of investment, the WTO  in an executive summary of its trade policy review of Pakistan. The report noted that Pakistan maintained persistent fiscal deficits during the review period and cited widespread tax evasion and other policies as significant drains on its revenues. Pakistan deficit exceeded 8 percent of GDP from 2011 to 2013 and fell to 5.3 percent in 20132014. ‘Positive LongTerm Bet.’ Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke  Pakistan is a “positive longterm bet” despite its faults, according to remarks submitted at the WTO trade policy review. Punke commended Pakistan first transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another in 2013 and attributed Pakistan relative growth and stability to “wellgrounded economic policymaking and adherence to [International Monetary Fund]prescribed reforms.” Punke  the bilateral trade relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan “still shows room for expansion.” In 2014, total trade between the nations was $5.2 billion, down from $5.5 billion in 2008. U.S. imports from Pakistan in 2014 totaled $3.7 billion, and U.S. exports to Pakistan were $1.5 billion. Punke noted that the WTO report “covers a period of time when Pakistan has needed to dedicate significant resources to address security concerns and respond to natural disasters, at times diverting resources from its economic development.” Tax Revenue Shortfall The WTO report emphasized the persistence of Pakistan revenue shortfalls and  that its tax revenues are among some of the lowest in the world with respect to GDP. Total fiscal revenue as a proportion of GDP declined to under 13 percent in 2012 and 2013, and tax revenue as a proportion of GDP declined to under 10 percent during the same period. The WTO blamed “widespread tax evasion, a wide array of tax exemptions, and failure to widen the tax base” for the decline in revenues. In particular, statutory regulatory orders (SROs), which provide tax and tariff exemptions, “are a significant drain on fiscal revenue,” the WTO report . “The use of ad hoc trade policy instruments under SROs remains common and severely undermines the predictability of the trade regime; it also supports a culture of rentseeking,” the WTO report . “The elimination of tariff and taxrelated SROs, planned for end2015, will significantly increase transparency of the trade regime.” Punke added that the U.S. has  it would monitor Pakistan effort to phase out SROs that had established special rates and nontariff trade barriers in some 4,000 product areas. High Expenditures Pakistan expenditures exceeded 21 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2013, due in part to its support of stateowned enterprises such as Pakistan International Airlines, Pakistan Railways, Pakistan Steel Mills and its power sector, the WTO report . “Consequently, Pakistan is now in a position where revenues cannot meet even current expenditures and the government has to borrow just to function,” the WTO executive summary . “The authorities realize the precarious fiscal position and have initiated a program of fiscal consolidation and the restructuring or privatization of stateowned enterprises.” ‘Cautious' Trade Liberalization Pakistan has taken some “cautious steps” towards trade liberalization since its last trade policy review in 2008, the WTO . However, regulatory exemptions and concessions provided for various industries under SRO regimes “remain an  source of deviation from [mostfavorednation] rates,” the WTO . Pakistan average applied mostfavorednation tariff is 14.3, slightly down from 14.8 percent in 2008. Since July 2014, Pakistan no longer has dutyfree tariff lines, and all but 45 tariff lines are ad valorem. Some 98 percent of tariff lines are bound; the average bound rate is 61.5 percent. “Despite cautious liberalization, overall tariff levels remain high, which weakens productivity growth and constitutes an impediment to efficient resource allocation and the integration of Pakistan into global value chains,” the WTO . Other Concerns Punke admonished the “tepid” level of overall foreign domestic investment (FDI) in the Pakistani economy, which fell from 3.2 percent in 2008 to 0.6 percent in 2013. “This disappointing result can be attributed to energy shortages, security concerns, and the bureaucratic hurdles to doing business in Pakistan,” Punke . The U.S. urged Pakistan to further improve its protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, “including through improvements in its administrative and judicial capacity as well as increase[d] transparency in IP decision making.” The U.S. also warned the Pakistani government not to interfere with pharmaceutical pricing and urged it to introduce “FDIfriendly” policies on setting pharmaceutical prices. The U.S. congratulated Pakistan for its 2014 auction of spectrum bands for commercial use and its approval of a liquid natural gas terminal at Port Karachi.\",\n",
       " 'Environmental Goods Agreement trade talks on track for negotiation stage Biores 25 March 2015 Talks towards securing a tariffcutting deal on environmental goods are now ready to shift from technical discussions into a second negotiation stage, trade sources have confirmed after the fifth round held last week in Geneva, Switzerland. This next negotiating stage would focus on whittling down a compilation of potential tariff lines to a final list slated for tariff liberalisation under the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) negotiations, as these trade talks are formally known. A current draft compilation of most participants’ indicative proposals made during the last eight months of scoping discussions numbers at nearly 600 tariff lines and goods. To date the talks among the now 17 participating WTO members – both Turkey and Iceland formally joined the negotiations in the latest round – have covered products falling under ten categories of environmental goods since kicking off in July last . Last week’s discussions focused specifically on possible products relating to the categories of environmental monitoring, analysis, and assessment (EMAA), environmentally preferable products (EPP), as well as resource efficiency. Officials say this “category approach” is geared towards ensuring the environmental credibility of the overall agreement, in other words, that the eventual goods included have positive environmental applications. Before this second negotiation stage begins, each participating member will formally put forward a list of product nominations by early April, officials confirmed last week. Participants’ lists will collate their various indicative product proposals made during the category discussions. During the next EGA round, scheduled for the first full week in May, trade negotiators will then move linebyline through a full compilation of all participants’ product lists. This exercise will be geared towards streamlining proposals and examining their environmental justifications, as well as starting to identify areas of consensus. Officials  that that they do not plan on using specific criteria to filter through the compiled list, although they may group similar products together, such as those related to LED lighting equipment. At the launch last July, participants  that they will build on and add to a list of 54 tariff lines agreed to by the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 2012. The 21country APEC group has committed to lowering applied tariffs on these 54 tariff lines to five percent or less by the end of this . (See BioRes, 10 July 2014) March categories discussion Sources  that last week’s discussion on the three categories made good progress. Proposed products relating to EMAA reportedly garnered broad support. These include, for example, goods such as multimetres used to measure voltage, resistance, and current in electrical equipment. Some officials have  that May’s negotiations might kick off with EMAArelevant products and then continue to move in reverse order through the ten categories discussed over the last eight months. Several participants also put forward indicative nominations last week relating to the EPP category. While these proposals reflected differences in understanding between participants around the term “environmentally preferable,” officials  that the category nevertheless proved useful, and helped to bring forward some nominations not made elsewhere. Some EPP goods tabled range from sealing devices, bamboo, and bicycles. EGA negotiators were also briefed by experts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on various descriptions of environmentally preferable products and the potential benefits of liberalising trade in these. According to the OECD, the EPP term was first defined at the international level in 1995 by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) as products that cause “significantly less environmental harm” at some stage in their life cycle. Many countries have since adopted a variety of definitions for products considered environmentally superior, ranging from “environmentally friendly” to “green.” Regarding the resource efficiency category, some participants did not nominate in this category due to overlaps with previous rounds, for example, goods related to energy efficiency discussed in January. (See BioRes, 6 February 2015) Goods on the table In addition to last week’s categories, EGA participants had previously discussed products related to cleaner and renewable energy; energy efficiency; wastewater management and water treatment; environmental remediation and cleanup; noise and vibration abatement; air pollution reduction and mitigation; and solid and hazardous waste management. Most EGA participants have come forward with indicative product nominations across the range of categories. Some duplicate nominations have been made between the categories, as well as between participants’ nominations. Countries such as Canada, the US, Japan, and Chinese Taipei are  to be among those that have made the most indicative proposals during the technical discussions. Israel, which formally joined the EGA during the January round, as well as newcomers Turkey and Iceland have not yet made proposals. However, this was not a measure of these countries’ ambition but rather due to their slightly later arrival to the talks, trade sources . The latest round saw China, which had previously not proposed any products, circulate its indicative list relating to nine out of the ten categories. This list reportedly includes around 70 tariff lines covering products related to water, air pollution, bamboo products, and highefficiency goods, among others. In addition to these Beijing would also support the 54 tariff lines covered by the APEC agreement. Based on the current indicative nominations, trade sources estimate that all 54 6digit level Harmonised System (HS) subheadings from the APEC deal have been put forward during the various category discussions. Parts of the APEC list are complicated, according to trade experts, because of the use of “exouts” to indicate that only one part of a particular HS subheading may be considered an environmental good. EGA delegates have, however,  that they are focused on the 54 tariff lines in the broadest sense in order not to get caught up in APEC implementation. Environmental services? While EGA officials at the launch last July explained that the negotiations would initially be focused on reducing tariffs on environmental goods, some participants would also like to see issues related to environmental services and nontariff barriers (NTBs) tackled further down the line. During a lunchtime sideevent discussion held last Friday by the Swedish National Board of Trade, researchers and panellists discussed how to liberalise trade in environmental services. Some differences of opinion emerged among participants and interventions from delegates, however, on whether to tackle these in the EGA or elsewhere. Negotiations are also ongoing among a separate group of WTO members – although with some overlapping membership – on a proposed standalone pact known as Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) designed to liberalise services trade in all sectors. Some EGA participants also involved in TISA would prefer to see environmental services addressed in the latter negotiation. Canada has tabled a specific annex in TISA dedicated to environmental services. This proposal, however, has reportedly faced some resistance in the servicesfocused talks. Some countries have reportedly  that a focus on environmental services alone may not be enough to cover all the services relevant for the delivery of environmental goods, such as engineering, maintenance, repair, training, and legal services. The next TISA round will be held in April, and is expected to set the groundwork for a July stocktaking session that aims to provide more clarity on the perimeter of the future services agreement, including which of the various proposals on the table have most support. (See Bridges Weekly, 19 February 2015) Next steps Formal discussion on the institutional arrangements for the planned Environmental Goods Agreement, covering issues such as how to include some sort of review mechanism to periodically update the list of covered goods, will likely only take place sometime after the May round. Talks on this review mechanism may be prompted by the eventual tabling of a draft text, which could be forthcoming from the EU, according to some other participants. As agreed in January, two further sessions are scheduled for the coming months, one planned for 1519 June and another for 2731 July. EGA participants have signalled a desire to successfully hammer out the main points of the deal in time for the WTO’s Tenth Ministerial Conference, scheduled to take place from 1518 December in Nairobi, Kenya. That international meet will follow hot on the heels from the UN climate talks in the first part of the month. EGA officials have in the past  that addressing climate change is an  dimension of their planned trade deal, although these talks have no formal link to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. New members? Sources  that, while no new members have formally requested to join, there might be a broader interest from some developing countries later on in the  as the UN climate talks approach. EGA officials have  that they continue to remain open to other WTO members joining the talks. The EGA talks are a plurilateral initiative negotiated among a group of WTO members. Participants have  they plan to extend the agreement to the rest of the global trade body on a “mostfavoured nation” (MFN) basis once the deal is concluded and if sufficient countries trading in the liberalised goods participate. Joining the talks before their conclusion, however, offers countries the opportunity to shape the terms of deal. Meanwhile China reportedly told other EGA members last week that it would soon circulate a nonpaper outlining the various development dimensions of the talks. Beijing  that this nonpaper would, among other things, reflect on how to attract more developing country participation in the future. ICTSD reporting.',\n",
       " \"Agriculture Lawmakers, Meat Industry Urge Repeal of COOL to Solve Trade Dispute By Catherine Boudreau WTO Reporter, March 26, 2015 March 25 — Lawmakers on a House Agriculture panel, along with the beef and pork industry, are calling for the repeal of countryoforigin labeling (COOL) regulations to avert potential retaliatory trade measures from Canada and Mexico. Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee Michael Conaway (RTexas)  the U.S. COOL rule, which requires meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered, is a failed experiment. He was followed by Reps. Ted Yoho (RFla.) and Vicky Hartzler (RMo.) that  they support Congress repealing the law. “Considering the discussions that took place prior to the initial passage of COOL in 2002, mainstream cattlemen and pork producers have raised concerns that this policy would likely not withstand legal challenges in the [World Trade Organization],” Conaway  March 25 at a Livestock and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee hearing. “Yet we proceeded to implement a program with enormous costs and no quantifiable benefits. Our North American livestock market has been unnecessarily fractured by this policy, but I believe that the damage can be repaired.” Michael T. Smith, special projects manager at Harris Ranch Company,  Canada and Mexico in 2014 each imported roughly $1 billion of U.S. beef, or roughly onethird of the total beef export value. “If we lose access to those markets, or have tariffs placed on them, it will have negative impacts on U.S. producers,” Smith . U.S. Awaits WTO Decision The U.S. is waiting for an appeals decision by a WTO dispute settlement body in a case that challenges the legality of COOL. Canada and Mexico filed the case, arguing COOL harms their pork and beef industries by distorting trade and imposing undue burdens and costs exceeding $1 billion per . The WTO report is expected to be issued by May 18. Should the WTO panel determine COOL isn't compliant with international standards, it may permit Mexico and Canada to seek retaliatory trade measures. Canada in June 2013 listed potential U.S. goods to target, including live cattle and hogs, cheese, fresh apples and cherries, rice and wine. The WTO has ruled against the COOL regulations three times, most recently in October 2014. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, whose agency implemented the COOL regulation, has  it can't be fixed administratively. Canada and Mexico need to specify what measures would be acceptable, or Congress must change the law. Damage to Beef Industry Refuted President of the National Farmers Union (NFU) Roger Johnson  Congress should wait to act on COOL until the WTO panel issues its report. If the U.S. loses its appeal, Canada and Mexico would need to demonstrate damage as a result of COOL in order to impose trade retaliations through statements and visits to the offices of American lawmakers. “There is no right to retaliate unless there is proven economic damages,” Roger  at the March 25 hearing. “The only evidence introduced to the WTO at this point is based on proprietary pricing data by the [Canadian Cattlemen Association]. It has been overwhelmingly refuted by publicly available data.” Johnson highlighted a January study by Auburn University professor C. Robert Taylor that  Canadian claims of economic damage to their beef exports to the U.S. were unfounded. “Dr. Taylor report found that the fed cattle price basis actually declined after COOL went into effect; that COOL had no negative impact on imports of slaughter cattle; and that COOL did not significantly affect imports of feeder cattle,” Johnson .\",\n",
       " 'EU slaps antidumping duties on China, Taiwan steel Lachlan CARMICHAEL 25 March 2015 Agence France Presse The EU announced Wednesday it will impose antidumping duties for six months on some steel imports from China and Taiwan as a new trade row erupted between Brussels and Beijing. The tariffs will affect imports of flatrolled stainless steel used to make products like washing machines, dishwashers, medical tools and automobiles. The European Union and China have already clashed over the alleged dumping of products ranging from wine to solar panels to steel pipes. Duties of around 25 percent for the targeted Chinese firms, including industrial giant Baosteel, and 10 percent for the Taiwan companies will take effect from Thursday, the European Union Official Journal . \"In the absence of measures, the dumped imports from the countries concerned will continue to force Union industry to sell at lossmaking prices,\" the journal . Chinese and Taiwanese companies that cooperated with the EU investigation are excluded from the duties. Following the news, the share prices of European steelmakers surged on the continent stock markets, before slowing later. Aperam, whose main shareholder is the Mittal family, was up 3.1 percent in afternoon trading in Amsterdam and Spain Acerinox climbed 1.5 percent in Madrid. But shares in Finland Outokumpu were down 0.65 after having traded up over two percent in the morning. The EU opened the investigation on June 26 last  after complaints from European competitors about the Chinese and Taiwanese firms. Chinese companies targeted in the latest decision include Baosteel Stainless Steel Co, Shanghai, Ningbo Baoxin Stainless Steel Co, Ningbo, Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co, Taiyun City and Tianjin TISCO and TPCO Stainless Steel Co, Tianjin City. Taiwan firms include Chia Far Industrial Factory Co, Taipei City, Tang Eng Iron Works Co, Kaohsiung City and Yieh United Steel Corporation, Kaohsiung City. Total imports from China and Taiwan rose by 70 percent between 2010 and the period of the investigation from mid2014 and early 2015, while the market share increased by 63 percent, the European Commission . The investigation found that the EU industry concerned suffered a production volume decline of five percent, which led to an eight percent drop in capacity utilisation. Market share declined by five percent, employment dropped by 11 percent, and labour costs increased by eight percent while investment decreased by 17 percent, it . \"It was clear that the strong increase of dumped imports led not only to deteriorating profitability but also to lost market share by the Union industry and drop in production, capacity utilisation, employment, investments and return on investments,\" the Official Journal . The companies from China and Taiwan can submit complaints to the EU and request a hearing from the European Commission, the executive of the 28country bloc. In February, a WTO panel largely ruled against China in its row with the European Union and Japan over Chinese antidumping duties on imports of steel pipes. In December, EU trade authorities opened an investigation into alleged price dumping by China on solar glass, a key component of solar panels. A 2013 trade row over solar panels sparked the EU biggestever trade probe covering a market worth some 21 billion euros ($25 billion) at its zenith. But last July, Brussels and China came to a hardwon agreement, ending heated rounds of titfortat measures that included a Chinese probe into European wine imports.',\n",
       " 'Indonesia defends deforestation for palm oil on economic grounds TRFN * Palm oil industry lowers poverty in Indonesia, official says * Most Indonesian export customers unworried by forest destruction * Deforestation a \"technical\" issue, not a trade issue By Stella Dawson WASHINGTON, March 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) Clearing forests for palm oil plantations is a \"technical\" matter that should not get tied up with trade discussions, an Indonesian minister told a land and poverty conference. Growing global demand for palm oil is fuelling rapid deforestation in Indonesia, at a faster pace than in Brazil Amazon region, making Indonesia a major contributor to global warming. But Prabianto Mukti Wibowo, assistant deputy minister for forestry in the Economic Affairs Ministry, told a World Bank conference on land and poverty held in Washington this week that deforestation was a richcountry concern. \"We know that our primary customers are not concerned about deforestation,\" he . Asian nations, led by India, China and Pakistan, buy 55 percent of Indonesia palm oil exports, while Europe buys only 8 percent, yet Europe puts much of the pressure on Indonesia not to cut down and burn forests to make way for plantations, he . Palm oil is  to Indonesia development because it reduces poverty by bringing roads, schools and other infrastructure to rural communities and generates five million jobs that benefit 15 million people, Wibowo . The pace of forest loss declined rapidly between 2009 and 2013, he , even before last  New York Declaration on Forests called for an end to deforestation by 2020. Hence the issue should be treated as a technical matter not a trade issue, and reserved for discussion in such forums as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) among industry, investors and civil society groups, he . \"The zero deforestation commitment should not be a trade barrier because deforestation is a governance issue and about effective implementation, not about trade,\" Wibowo . Illegal logging, a primary source of deforestation in Indonesia, is under discussion at the World Trade Organisation, which aims to complete some environmental negotiations by July as part of the Doha round of global trade talks. Indonesia also signed a 2006 memorandum to combat illegal logging as part of its trade agreement with the United States. (Reporting by Stella Dawson; Editing by Tim Pearce)',\n",
       " 'Myanmar launches export strategy to connect smaller firms to global economy By Jared Ferrie YANGON, March 25 (Reuters) Myanmar on Tuesday launched an export strategy aimed at strengthening smaller companies, which is a departure from 49  of military rule when a few large firms dominated the economy,  the International Trade Centre (ITC). Myanmar economy was eviscerated by poor management and corruption under the former military government, and Western countries imposed strict sanctions in response to human rights abuses. A semicivilian government has implemented sweeping political and economic reforms since taking power in 2011. In recognition, the European Union, Australia, the United States and other countries have lifted or eased sanctions. That has opened the door to the global economy, and the ITC, which is affiliated with the United Nations and World Trade Organization, worked with the government and the German aid agency, GIZ, to develop the country first ever national export strategy. \"We really want to ensure that now also these small and medium sized enterprises are included in the process,\"  Irina Scheffmann of GIZ. \"It not only big companies that have a share of the cake.\" The former military government tightly controlled the economy, a situation that benefited a handful of firms owned by socalled cronies, many of whom remain on the United States\\' list of sanctioned individuals.

       " 'US caught off guard by success of new Chinaled bank Jeremy TORDJMAN 26 March 2015 Agence France Presse The success of the new Chinaled development bank has caught the United States off guard, after it fought the project and now finds itself increasingly isolated. Britain, Germany, France... the United States has watched, helpless and dumbfounded, as its European allies flocked to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a potential rival to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, both institutions under powerful US influence. The list does not stop there. Other US allies, like Australia and South Korea, are considering joining the AIIB, which already has about 30 member nations and the blessing of International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde. \"The US has been caught flatfooted by the rush of countries, including its close economic and political allies, that are lining up to join the Chinaled AIIB,\" Eswar Prasad, a former head of the IMF China division, told AFP, pointing to the \"declining power of the US in driving the global economic policy agenda.\" The Obama administration has been waging an intense but lowprofile lobbying campaign against rival China $50 billion bank project unveiled in October. Officials have insinuated that the AIIB would lower international development standards. \"Will it adhere to the kinds of high standards that the international financial institutions have developed? Will it protect the rights of workers, the environment, deal with corruption issues appropriately?\" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  last week in testimony in Congress. The upfront opposition, which is fed by a climate of mistrust between the world leading economic superpower and its fastgrowing rival, has proved ineffective. \"The US became isolated on the issue relatively early because they were so vocally critical. As a result the US lost the opportunity to have more of an open discussion with countries who were considering joining,\"  Scott Morris, a former Treasury official, in an interview. That failure has its consequences. In a rarity since the end of World War II, the United States must prepare to cope with a multilateral institution on which it will have no direct influence. Accustomed to constructing the world financial architecture, the United States may be overconfident and underestimated the powerful attraction of China and its colossal cash reserves. \"The United States has only known its status as a leader and it has psychologically not adjusted to the real emergence of other countries including China. Their mentality is a bit behind the reality,\"  Hongying Wang, an expert on USChina relations at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think tank. According to experts, Washington also underestimated the weariness of certain countries, including its allies, with its lack of enthusiasm for multilateral economics. The United States is blocking 2010 reforms of the IMF that would raise the voting rights of emerging powers and sometimes is accused of neglecting the World Bank. Washington is the major stakeholder in both institutions. \"These countries have more ambition for larger multilateral institutions and they become frustrated with the position of the United States, which is not terribly ambitious,\" Morris, the former Treasury official,  of the countries that are joining the AIIB. Growing aware of its isolation, the United States has begun to relax its position by opening the door to cooperation with the Chinaled bank, which is expected to be open for business by the end of the . \"The United States would welcome new multilateral institutions that strengthen the international financial architecture,\"  Nathan Sheets, Treasury under secretary for international affairs, on Monday. In a recent blog post, the US Treasury  that it will continue to \"engage directly\" with China and coordinate with other international partners \"to provide concrete suggestions on how the AIIB can best adopt and implement highquality standards.\" The United States may find it difficult to go further. An attempt to join the AIIB would certainly raise hackles in Congress and could be seen as an acknowledgement of weakness. \"This would be politically very difficult,\" Morris . The episode in any case has shifted the landscape. By rallying a number of countries to its project, Beijing has proven that it is \"finally maturing\" and that it can provide \"constructive leadership\" in the international community,  Prasad. That is \"making it harder for the US to counter China increasing international influence,\" he . Opinions/Invités',\n",
       " \"WTO DirectorGeneral Touts Changing Tides in Doha Talks Despite Agricultural Discord By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 27, 2015 March 26 — The directorgeneral of the World Trade Organization  members have entered a new phase of their latest Doha Round talks whereby specific proposals and solutions are actively debated among members. “At this point in time the negotiations are changing gears very visibly, very clearly,” Roberto Azevedo told reporters at a March 26 news conference in Geneva. The shift marks a notable departure from past Doha Round conversations where members had generally rehashed old positions from 2008. “That has clearly changed,” Azevedo . “Right now you will see a number of delegations exploring new approaches, suggesting new approaches. There have been new proposals put on the table. “ “We are moving more from a situation of identification of problems and difficulties and gaps to one where we are trying to find solutions,” Azevedo . New Proposals This , members have endeavored to address the lingering Bali Ministerial goals of liberalizing multilateral rules regarding agriculture, nonagricultural market access and services. Through an intensive consultation process members have begun negotiating terms to improve market access, eliminate export subsidies and reduce tradedistorting domestic support in line with the goals of the group Doha Development Agenda. The members' nearterm goal is to present, by July 31, a detailed work program that ideally leads to the conclusion of the Doha Round. Though the process has been slow, members like Paraguay and Argentina have introduced new proposals that seek to replace some of the negotiating texts from 2008 regarding market access terms. Paraguay, suggested members adopt a series of average tariff cuts for developed and developing nations, with special protections for small and lesserdeveloped countries. Argentina proposal would consider offers and requests by individual members instead of a tiered tariffreduction formula. No Convergence Azevedo acknowledged that the new proposals have not yet produced an accord among members and agriculture continues to be the key area for discussions. “In the three pillars of agriculture the bigger challengers are in domestic support and in market access,” Azevedo . In a recent document, the G33 46 members—which include China, India and Indonesia—rejected Paraguay and Argentina proposals because they deviate from the text of the December 2008 draft modalities (Rev. 4), which are formulas for reducing tradedistorting measures. G33 nations  there is potential to improve the Rev. 4 text but reaffirmed their steadfast support for the document as a central component in their effort to improve policies regarding domestic support and market access for agricultural products. Some developed nations—like the U.S.—argue that market realities have dramatically changed since 2008 and the negotiations must take account for the increased impact that developing countries have upon the multilateral trading system. Export Competition One agricultural area where there is greater convergence among members is in the discussions to eliminate export subsidies, Azevedo . “Members, I think, are less distant from each other on that pillar,” he . Last month, 16 members of the Cairns Group endorsed a proposal to eliminate export subsidies in line with the 2008 revised draft modalities for agriculture(27 WTO, 2/10/15). The Feb. 6 proposal urged members to adopt the relevant elements of Rev. 4—namely Section III, paragraphs 160169 and related annexes J, K and L—at the December 2015 Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. “The rest will have to follow,” Azevedo . “It not an agriculture only round. Goods, services and all the other areas of the Doha negotiations are on the table.”\",\n",
       " 'NZ ambassador hauled before Brazilian foreign minister STACEY KIRK Stuff Last updated 17:41, March 27 2015 The Brazil Government has called for an explanation, over revelations New Zealand GCSB snooped on its diplomat who was competing with Trade Minister Tim Groser for the top job at the World Trade Organisation in 2013. New Zealand ambassador to Brazil, Caroline Bilkey, has been called upon to explain leaked documents showing New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) spied on rival candidates for the top job at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). United Statesbased website The Intercept released explosive documents on March 24, alleging the GCSB used its specialist spyware to snoop on Trade Minister Tim Groser rivals for a job as the WTO directorgeneral. Documents obtained by The Intercept show that, leading up to the May 2013 appointment, the GCSB set up a programme to snoop on emails about the other candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico and South Korea. In what it labelled the \"WTO project\", the GCSB looked for emails referring to Groser, the WTO, and the surnames of other candidates. It targeted the Indonesian candidate in particular. The claims are the latest in a series based on documents obtained by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden. Brazilian diplomat Roberto Azevedo was the successful candidate for the role and still sits at the head of the WTO, while Groser bid was seen as a long shot. He failed to make the final cut but the Government poured its resources behind him in an effort to secure international backing for his candidacy. On Thursday, the Brazilian Department for External Relation confirmed New Zealand Ambassador Caroline Bilkey was hauled in by their SecretaryGeneral of Foreign Affairs for a \"please explain\". \"The Brazilian Government has learned with surprise of media reports indicating that electronic mail on the candidacy of Ambassador Roberto Carvalho de Azevedo for the post of Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been the subject of a violation by the Government New Zealand. \"The Brazilian government expressed its determination to see the issue more fully worked out within the framework of the friendship that has always existed in relations between the two countries,\" the department  in a translated statement. \"Ambassador of New Zealand yesterday called the Foreign Ministry by the Secretary General of Foreign Affairs, with the expectation that the New Zealand Government to provide the necessary explanations on the subject.\" Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully confirmed the meeting had taken place. In a statement, he : \"We can confirm that MFAT officials in Brazil have discussed the matters raised in media reporting with their counterparts. \"If foreign governments want to raise issues about the assumptions being made by journalists we will respond. We will do this in private rather than through the news media.\" Meanwhile, Fiji has also taken action in relation to separate revelations New Zealand had spied on it and other countries in the Pacific. The Fiji Times reported defence minister Timoci Natuva  the government would invest in extensive security measures to make its communication networks more secure. Those allegations, also made in documents released by The Intercept, are now the subject of an inquiry by the spying watchdog, InspectorGeneral for Intelligence and Security Cheryl Gwyn. Natuva reportedly  the government would not write to New Zealand over the allegations. Stuff',\n",
       " 'U.S. questions China at WTO on banking technology restrictions By Tom Miles GENEVA, March 26 (Reuters) The United States is concerned about China restrictions on the use of foreign information technology equipment by the banking sector, according to a filing published by the World Trade Organization on Thursday. U.S. business groups have already complained about the new rules, which China announced in December, and senior officials including Secretary of State John Kerry have written to their Chinese counterparts about them. Japan and the European Union have echoed U.S. concerns about the regulations, which China says aim to promote cybersecurity. By bringing up the issue at the WTO, where member countries can legally challenge foreign laws that affect trade, the United States has put pressure on China to explain how the regulations which aim to promote \"secure and controllable\" banking technology comply with global trade rules. \"Could China explain what \\'controllable\\' means?,\" the U.S. filing asked. \"Do the guidelines apply to foreignowned banks operating in China?\" Although it did not question China right to improve cybersecurity, it  the definition of \"secure and controllable\" would severely limit access to the commercial banking sector for many foreign products and services and dictate the business decisions of financial institutions. That raised the question of compliance with WTO rules, which bar countries from favouring domestic producers over competitors abroad, the United States . The regulations specify that all new computer servers, desktop computers and laptop computers and 50 percent of new tablets and smartphones bought by the banking industry must meet \"security and controllability\" requirements, it . The new regulations represent one of China most significant steps toward banishing foreign technology, 18 months after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American tech exports to snoop on overseas targets. The rules also aim to encourage \"indigenous innovation\", but \"the requirement for a product to be \\'indigenous\\' would allow for little involvement by foreign companies,\" the filing . Among the U.S. questions for China was a request to explain the meaning of \"indigenous\" software whether the code had to be mainly written by Chinese nationals or on Chinese territory or copyrighted in China and why indigenous software was favoured over nonindigenous. \"Does China exclude the possibility that foreigndeveloped technology may provide a better security solution than a technology developed indigenously?,\" it asked.

       " 'WTO Decision in U.S.India Solar Dispute Expected in Late August By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 27, 2015 March 26 — A World Trade Organization panel  it will determine, by “late August,” whether India solar energy program violated international trade rules. Participants had expected the WTO to reach a conclusion in the case, which centers on U.S. claims that India domestic sourcing requirements are discriminatory, before the end of March. On March 26, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)  it would not issue its final report within the sixmonth timeframe required by the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. The delay is due, in part, to a backlog created by the increased frequency of complex disputes being considered by the DSB. Though the DSB hired eight new dispute attorneys this week, WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo told reporters that the “resources of the secretariat are being stretched to the limit.” Systemic Delays The panel was established on May 23, 2014, after the U.S. claimed India Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission unfairly discriminated against imported solar cells and modules in favor of domestic products (102 WTO, 5/28/14). The WTO named three mediators in the case on Sept. 29, 2014. The U.S. claimed that India domestic sourcing rules were inconsistent with India obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Agreement on TradeRelated Investment Measures, and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The U.S. solar industry has urged the U.S. to dispute India requirements, although some environmental groups—like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace—say a prolonged disagreement could hinder solar deployment.',\n",
       " 'U.S. groups don\\'t want trade war with Canada; Ottawa could impose tariffs on American oranges, wines, candy ALEXANDER PANETTA The Canadian Press 26 March 2015 Montreal Gazette Business interests are pleading with the U.S. Congress to avert a trade war with Canada that could squeeze Florida orangegrowers, put a cork in California wine exports and sour the sales of American chocolate. Several groups Wednesday asked lawmakers to undo legislation that caused trade tensions with U.S. neighbours, prompting Canada and Mexico to threaten widespread retaliation. They urged a House of Representatives Committee to change the countryoforigin meatlabelling rules before it causes blowback for all sorts of American industries. \"This is a dark cloud that is forming over U.S. exporters,\"  Christopher Wenk of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"This is a very urgent topic.\" Canada has already listed a series of products that could be slapped with tariffs, should it and Mexico follow up their recent successes at the World Trade Organization with a win in the final round. But proponents of U.S. countryoforigin rules say consumers deserve to know where their meat comes from. Those mandatory U.S. labels explain where livestock was born, raised and slaughtered. Opponents say those labels do nothing to affect safety standards, cause headaches for businesses during processing, and amount to a protectionist measure that has slashed Canadian meat exports to the U.S. by half. The Canadian government has expressed optimism that there might be more sympathy for its position in the new, Republicandominated Congress even though the issue doesn\\'t fall neatly along partisan lines. It certainly sounded CanadaandMexicofriendly on Wednesday. The politicians who spoke at the House agriculture committee hearing, as well as the people invited to testify, almost all supported repealing the law. \"Clearly there no upside to this (rule),\"  Republican Vicky Hartzler of Missouri. \"It not good for America, it not good for the producers, the processors, and it not good for the mom that goes to the grocery store that has to pay more for products. So we really do need repealing.\" Linda Dempsey of the National Manufacturers Association warned: \"Time is running out. It is imperative that Congress act quickly.\" The vicepresident of California Wine Institute, Tom LaFaille, warned that producers lost 50 per cent of their exports to Mexico a decade ago because of retaliatory measures and it took  to rebuild. LaFaille  he doesn\\'t want a repeat. Wine is on Canada lengthy hit list for possible tariffs. Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida expressed fear for his state: \"Canada is Florida largest trading partner also it would be tough for us. We ship a lot of citrus up there.\" American candymakers aren\\'t too sweet on a trade war, either. Alison Bodor, the vicepresident of their lobby group, the National Confectioners Association, noted that Canada published list of potential tariffs includes different types of chocolate and sugarfree sweeteners. \"Many Americanmade chocolates will disappear from Canadian shelves,\" she . \"That loss of business will impact U.S. confectionary companies, their workers, and ly also their communities.\" A rare voice in support of national meatlabelling Wednesday was the National Farmers Union. While several big livestock associations oppose the existing law, the NFU isn\\'t one of them. The group president, Roger Johnson, urged lawmakers to be patient. He  they should wait to see the final WTO ruling, expected soon, before taking any drastic measures. He  about 70 other countries have meatlabelling requirements. Also, in the latest rounds at the WTO, he  the body decisions against the U.S. have become increasingly narrow in scope. He  the trade body has never ruled against the principle of countryoforigin labelling only the way the law has been applied and he suggested the U.S. still had a chance of winning the final round.',\n",
       " 'Japan Again Asks S. Korea to Lift Import Ban on Fishery Products London, March 26 (Jiji Press)Japan on Thursday reiterated its call for an early removal of South Korea import ban on fishery products from Fukushima and seven other prefectures that was introduced following Japan worst nuclear accident. Tokyo made the request at a meeting of a World Trade Organization panel on food safety, held at the WTO headquarters in Geneva. South Korea introduced the ban in September 2013 following massive leaks of radiationtainted water from Tokyo Electric Power Co. <9501> Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan, which was knocked out by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The seven other Japanese prefectures are Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma and Chiba. At the panel meeting, Japanese officials argued that the South Korean ban is not based on scientific grounds. This time, the Japanese side sought an early lifting of the ban especially because farmed sea squirts are set to be shipped from areas hit by the disaster this summer for the first time since the quake and tsunami. Sea squirts are a popular food item in South Korea. In response to Japan repeated requests, the South Korean government started last September a study on whether to remove the ban. But it is unclear how the country is conducting the review and when it will draw a conclusion. Japan has urged South Korea to clarify the review process and make an objective decision.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Sees \\'Pervasive\\' Circumvention Of AD Duties, Seeks WTO Discussion Inside U.S. Trade 03/27/2015 Five  after Sen. Ron Wyden (DOR) flagged the problem, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is seeking a discussion in the World Trade Organization on the increased proliferation of services offering importers and exporters help in evading antidumping (AD) duties. \"Such evasions of the applications of antidumping duties undermine the effectiveness of the [Antidumping Agreement] and erode confidence in the rulesbased multilateral trading system,\" the U.S.  in a twopage paper dated March 17 that outlined the problem in general terms. According to the paper, the U.S. is seeking to notify members of the Informal Group on AntiCircumvention of the growing problem of AD evasion, particularly through such evasion services. It notes that it also wants to obtain information on how the other members counter or eliminate such efforts. The paper does not identify which countries engage in such evasion of orders, but does refer to the 2010 staff report prepared for Wyden, which cites numerous examples of evasion offers related to products from China. The staff report  a Wyden aide set up a fictitious company profile on China largest businesstobusiness ecommerce website, Alibaba.com, in order to find companies willing to evade AD/CVD orders. Over a twoweek period, the aide purporting to be a purchasing manager contacted roughly 120 companies, and got 47 responses, 10 of them written offers to evade duties on five different Chinese products subject to AD/CVD orders. A trade lawyer involved in anticircumvention issues for petitioners also  this week that the problem is largely a Chinese one. The Informal Group on AntiCircumvention is solely a discussion forum, which is limited in its power to making recommendations to the Committee on Antidumping Practices, according to the WTO. It generally meets the same day as the formal committee, whose next meeting is scheduled for April 29. So few participants raise issues in the group that Brazil in October last  proposed that the group not reconvene until members do so. Brazil idea, however, was dismissed. The last paper the U.S. submitted on circumvention to the group was on Oct. 17, 2003, and was more lengthy and detailed than the March 17 paper. Specifically, the older paper drove home the need to carefully examine circumvention claims to ensure they really involve \"minor\" alterations in a product under AD order to avoid such duties. It provided a case study involving identical modifications by Japanese and Canadian producers to carbon steel, which was subject to a trade remedy order. But upon closer examination, Commerce found that Canada was engaging in circumvention in this case, while Japan was not because it made the alterations to affect the product characteristics. The only other papers submitted in recent  were two from New Zealand in 2004 and 2007 respectively, according to the WTO. One labor source placed the new anticircumvention paper firmly in the context of an administration campaign to show enforcement efforts in the runup to a potential vote on a bill to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as fast track. \"This is all about fast track,\" the labor source , who was critical of proponent claims that TPA will pave the way for jobcreating trade deals. \"The only way that fast track creates jobs is in getting the administration to initiate enforcement actions.\" The source noted that the WTO paper seems to be aimed at industrial products, while last week USTR request for a WTO panel on Argentina import licensing scheme is focused on U.S. agriculture exports. He anticipated that USTR would make several more enforcement efforts involving industrial sectors in the near future. According to the U.S. paper, the problem of circumvention has \"become more pervasive and the parties have become more brazen in their activities,\" but it fails to provide any numbers or any details specifying how this is the case. \"Accordingly, the United States believes it warrants a more detailed discussion in this Group,\" according to the paper. The paper only offers one example for such an evasion scheme, which it says involves shipping goods under AD orders from one country to another, reloading them and providing papers claiming that intermediary country as the export nation. The services provided include manipulating and creating new invoicing, packaging lists, and other related documentation to disguise the actual country of origin, the U.S. . Typically, there are no other services provided that would constitute substantial transformation of the good in question, adding significant value or any other activities that would confer origin to a new country, the U.S. paper says.',\n",
       " 'EU to end milk quota on March 31 BRUSSELS, March 26 (Xinhua) The European Union (EU)  on Thursday its milk quota regime will come to an end on March 31, a move aiming to increase the marketorientation of the dairy sector and boost exports of dairy products. The EU milk quota regime was first introduced in 1984 at a time when EU production far outstripped demand. The quota regime was one of the tools introduced for overcoming these structural surpluses. \"The situation today is completely different to that in 1984 with this more market oriented sector. You will recall that those were the days of butter mountains and milk lakes,\"  Phil Hogan, the EU commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development. The decision to end the quota regime was made in order to provide EU producers with more flexibility to respond to growing demand, especially on the world market. Even with quotas, EU dairy exports have increased by 45 percent in volume and 95 percent in value in the last 5 . \"We are now more competitive in world market prices. Intervention prices are set at a level that does not encourage surplus milk production and we are able to export 11 percent of our milk production without any kind of subsidies at all,\" Hogan . Market projections indicate that the prospects for further growth remain strong in particular for addedvalue products, such as cheese, but also for ingredients used in nutritional, sports and dietary products. Hogan added that the EU will introduce new market mechanisms to prevent any disorder in the dairy sector after abolishing the quotas. For example, the European Investment Bank will assist member states to restructure the dairy industry with a new financial instrument.',\n",

Grain farmers have until next Tuesday to choose between the federal government new subsidy programs created under the 2014 Farm Bill agricultural risk coverage (ARC), which is a priceaverage option, and price lose coverage (PLC), which is a fixedprice program. By Tuesday farmers also must update their crop acreage and yield history, data that will be used to determine farmers\\' subsidies over the life of the five federal law. Responding to a Reuters inquiry, the USDA  in a statement that 94 percent of grain farmers had updated their crop history as of March 19, but only 77 percent had elected either ARC or PLC to complete their five eligibility for payments. \"We do not yet have a breakdown of how many have chosen ARC and how many PLC,\" USDA spokesman Cullen Schwarz added. University economists who have been teaching farmers about the complicated new programs say ARC is a big favorite among corn and soybean farmers while PLC will likely be more popular with crops like wheat, sorghum, barley, rice and peanuts. Covered commodities include barley, canola, chickpeas, corn, crambe, flaxseed, sorghum, lentils, mustard seed, oats, peanuts, dry peas, rapeseed, rice, safflower seed, sesame, soybeans, sunflower seed and wheat. Upland cotton is no longer a covered commodity. Late last month the USDA extended the deadline for farmers to update their farm history from Feb. 27 to March 31, matching the time to enroll in a specific subsidy program. \"No announcement yet on whether there will be an extension,\" Schwarz .

       " 'Imported rice volume in FY 2014 to fall to lowest in nearly 20  Kyodo News TOKYO, March 26 The amount of rice imported into Japan in the current business  under exceptional tarifffree quotas is set to drop to the lowest in nearly 20 , farm ministry officials  Thursday. The volume in fiscal 2014 that ends Tuesday will be the lowest since fiscal 1995 when socalled \"minimum access\" quotas were introduced due to falling prices of domestically produced rice. The average price of domestically produced rice in January stood at 12,078 yen per 60 kilograms, down 17 percent from a  earlier. Under the ongoing TransPacific Partnership free trade talks, the Japanese government has proposed a plan to further increase annual rice imports from the United States by some 50,000 tons without tariffs, in exchange for retaining its current 778 percent tariffs on rice. Japan wants to retain tariffs on rice a staple food in Japan and one of the country main farm products under the TPP deal to protect domestic farmers. But the drop in rice imports suggests demand for overseas rice may not increase even if tariffs are abolished. \"The farm ministry is trying to increase imports as it is obsessed with keeping tariffs, which will result in lowering Japan food selfsufficiency,\"  Kazuhito Yamashita, a senior fellow at the Canon Institute for Global Studies. Under the minimum access quotas, Japan needs to import as much as 770,000 tons of rice annually, a deal which the country agreed on in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in exchange for rice tariffication. While most rice imported under the quotas is used for processed products such as rice crackers as well as livestock feed, 100,000 tons are imported for the staple. But bids were made only for 11,600 tons in fiscal 2014. In such a case, the rest is imported for processed products.',\n",

       " 'SNB warns of ‘difficult times’ as currency move hits home Laura Noonan in Zurich Financial Times March 26, 2015 8:04 pm Switzerland is facing “difficult times” and a short period of deflation following January’s abrupt unwinding of a currency peg, one of the Swiss National Bank’s most senior policy makers  on Thursday night. The comments from Fritz Zurbrugg, one of three permanent members of the SNB’s governing board, show the impact of the January 15 currency move on an economy often regarded as a safe harbour during the eurozone crisis. The Swiss franc has shot up in value since the removal of the peg that capped it at SFr1.20 per euro, making Swiss exports and Swiss holidays more expensive. A euro is now worth SFr1.05. “This , the stronger Swiss franc will have a noticeable damping effect on economic activity in Switzerland,” Mr Zurbrugg  in Zurich. “CPI [consumer price index] inflation will decline well into negative territory.” Switzerland’s stock market — home to global groups such as UBS, Credit Suisse, Novartis and Zurich Insurance — fell sharply in the days after the SNB’s announcement but has largely rebounded. In an effort to ward off the danger of deflation in the 18country eurozone, the European Central Bank has launched a €1.1tn quantitative easing programme in which it will, in effect, print money. Mr Zurbrugg  that the fall in prices that Switzerland faces is “temporary” and would not threaten price stability in the medium term. “A damaging deflationary spiral is not expected.” Swiss inflation is already in negative territory, with prices falling 0.8 per cent in February — worse than the 0.3 per cent fall in prices across the eurozone in the month. The SNB complemented January’s currency move by reducing deposit interest to 0.75 per cent in an effort to prevent a wave of cash flowing into Switzerland in anticipation of the Swiss franc’s rise in value. “The introduction of negative interest is already having the desired effect,”  Mr Zurbrugg, pointing to falling interest rates across the board. “It is  that the negative interest rate be allowed to take effect and help to bring about a weakening of the Swiss franc,” he . “Efforts to circumvent negative interest rates by obtaining exemptions or shifting to cash are not in the interests of Switzerland as a whole in the current climate.” Speaking at the same event, Dewet Moser, an alternate member of the SNB’s governing council,  the central bank had more tools it could use to make sure it achieved its policy objectives. “If required, the SNB will continue to deploy unconventional methods for monetary policy implementation,” he . “Equally, it will continue to take account of the exchange rate situation and, if necessary, will intervene in the foreign exchange market.” END',\n",
       " 'Spying on WTO justified by economic ambitions 28 March 2015 The New Zealand Herald Keeping tabs on candidates for director general job the best way to protect New Zealand, and the worlds trade interests The revelation that New Zealand has used its external intelligence agency to tap the communications of candidates for the top job at the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation posed the question: is this a proper use of spies? The answer, I think, is hell yeah. The director general of the WTO is not some cosy international status job for retired or defeated politicians, at least for New Zealand it is not. It is the cockpit for driving global rounds of negotiations towards a world in which people can buy and sell freely across national borders under fair trading laws and recognised property rights. There is probably no international post more  to New Zealands welfare, and probably no trade minister on the world stage more committed than Tim Groser to the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO ideal. He devoted his previous diplomatic career to trade liberalisation and entered Parliament on Nationals list purely to pursue the project with political power. If any of those seeking the director generals chair two  ago were capable of kicking the latest round back to life it was Groser, and member states knew it. That is  to be why he failed to make the short list. Sadly, a free and fair global trading environment is not a universal goal of governments, though nearly all pay lip service to it. The majority joined the newly formed HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO in the 1990s. It was the the one institution that had eluded the postwar creation of the United Nations and other foundations of international cooperation and a lasting peace. The 1990s was a time of renewed hope. The Berlin wall had been torn down, the West had won the cold war, monetarism was defeating inflation and competitive markets were acknowledged to be the source of economic success. But looking back, it was probably naive to think the countries signing up to the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO in droves were all converts to free trade. Protection is always easier politics in countries that depend on declining industries or want to subsidise surplus agriculture for the sake of maintaining rural life. The HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO is still in the grip of nations in no hurry to see progress. They treat trade talks as a contest of reluctant concessions in which it is better to stall and stymie agreements than to upset protected constituencies. They dont admit this openly, nor do their candidates for the WTO directors chair. If tapping their internet traffic can flush out their real intentions, Im all for it. The surveillance is certainly legal. The GCSBs legislation gives the bureau three stated objectives: the national security of New Zealand, the international relations and wellbeing of New Zealand, and the economic wellbeing of New Zealand. The last would certainly be served by the election of a good WTO director. Arguably New Zealands international relations are less well served if the espionage is made public. This weeks Snowden drop came just as John Key was about to sign a free trade agreement with South Korea, whose candidate was one of the targets, and it didnt sabotage the deal. It was clear in the Heralds report that the surveillance continued after Groser had missed the cut. The intelligence on other candidates might have been widely shared and appreciated by countries that share New Zealands free trade credentials. There may be precious few of them but with the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO Doha Round stalled they are making progress on other fronts. Regional and bilateral free trade agreements can be steps in the right direction if they are open to all countries willing to embrace HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO ideals. New Zealand did the worlds first bilateral treaty with China and, along with Singapore, Chile and Bahrain, formed the regional pact that has grown into the hemispheric TransPacific Partnership proposal. The TPP is now the big game in global trade liberalisation, offering hopes of agreement on intellectual property rights, investment rights, biosecurity and much else besides trade in all goods and services. It is being watched closely by Europe and the rest of the world and fiercely opposed by those who claim that it will restrict democratic rights. It cannot restrict the power of governments to do anything they like, but if they inflict unreasonable damage on a private investment the investor could seek damages from an international tribunal. Sounds fair to me. Its a little chilling to read Jane Kelseys criticism of the latest draft investment treaty yesterday. There is no agreement on restricting capital flows in a financial crisis, she wrote. That is somebodys right to withdraw their own money should New Zealand ever be governed like, say, Brazil, whose currency fell with a thud last week. A candidate from Brazil got the job at the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTOs magnificent palace at Geneva. Sometime later he was moved by reports of progress in the TPP to announce a new Doha initiative, but nothing happened.',\n",

Beef exports to Indonesia have seesawed in recent , reaching a high in 2010 of 48,823 tonnes, making it New Zealand second largest beef market for that , behind the US (156,173 tonnes), but ahead of other markets like Korea (39,110 tonnes), and Japan (37,402 tonnes). The Indonesia market was then worth $185 million. But in 2011 the Indonesian government introduced import quota restrictions on beef as part of a programme to become self sufficient in a range of agricultural products. Exports tailed off until last  when the Indonesians relaxed restrictions. By September 2014 exports to Indonesia grew to about 20,000 tonnes of beef, worth $79m, compared to just over 10,000 tonnes the  before. However, fresh calls for self sufficiency have coincided with the election of President Joko Widodo late last . In January this  the Indonesian government banned the import of the bulk of secondary cuts and offal, and New Zealand exports fell to a trickle of 28 tonnes that month. Meat Industry Association chief executive Tim Ritchie  the import restrictions had led to shortages of beef and price rises in Indonesia. \"During the period that they were in place, there were regular Indonesian media reports that retailers and processed beef manufacturers were facing a shortage of beef, as domestic supplies could not make up for the reduction in imports, and that the resulting shortage pushed up beef prices for consumers,\" Ritchie . A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman  Cabinet agreed in 2013 that New Zealand would initiate HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO dispute settlement proceedings challenging Indonesia import restrictions on agricultural products.

On Thursday New Zealand joined the US also a beef exporter in requesting a HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO dispute settlement panel. New Zealand and the US will be cocomplainants in this dispute, the MFAT spokeswoman . The Government believed that Indonesia restrictions \"undermined core HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO principles and are inconsistent with key obligations in the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO agreements\", the MFAT spokeswoman . She  the \"isolated trade dispute\" would not negatively affect New Zealand \"strong broader relationship\" with Indonesia.

       " 'New Foreign Trade Policy for 20152020 set to be \\'different\\' 29 March 2015 Business Standard Government is all set to finally unveil the long awaited Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) for a period of five  from 20152020 which is poised to be \"different\" from previous such policies even as it will put special emphasis on promotion of manufacturing and services exports. The FTP, which seeks to offer an incentive package for the exporting community, is generally released for a period of five  with annual supplements to revise the sops offered to the exporters depending on domestic and global factors. \"The new Foreign Trade Policy is going to be for the period 20152020. This time the policy is going to be different. We have taken a calibrated and openended approach to strengthen our exports,\" minister of state (independent charge) for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman told Business Standard. The new FTP got delayed by a  as it had to be in tandem with Prime Minister HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Narendra Modi larger vision of Make in India, Digital India and ease of doing business initiatives, commerce department officials told Business Standard. According to the officials, the delay was mainly because last  budget was not a fullfledged budget and it was only for a period of eight months, hence, the government was left with a small fiscal space to squeeze in various types of exportoriented incentives scheme. \"The policy had to be given a financial connotation, which was not there last . Since last  the government only came in May and the budget was passed in July, it was not clear as to how much will the export sector get,\"  a commerce department official. It seems unlikely that the government will set any specific target for exports to achieve. Besides, all these , the FTP has been more favourable towards exports compared to imports. Bucking the trend, this time the government might announce measures to promote the import of valueadded imports. This  the thrust will be given mainly on manufacturing exports and services exports. In manufacturing exports, it will chart out a strategy on how to promote manufacturing exports in the key sectors of engineering products, electronic goods and textile exports. In services, there will be a host of incentives that are likely to be rolled out to sectors such as tourism, hospitality, education and others that might be promoted in the form of project exports from India. According to HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Sanjay Budhia, chairman, National Committee on Exports and Export Competitiveness at the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Confederation of India Industry (CII), \"The government should view export sector as an engine of growth and give its due importance. We need to retain our existing markets as well as the new markets in line with Make in India vision of the PM. Besides, this  the government should bring the top exporting sectors under the purview of Focus Market Scheme and provide interest subvention to these sectors.\" Focus Market Scheme is an incentive package under which exporters are entitled for duty credit scrip that is equivalent to 3 per cent of the freeonboard (FOB) value of exports in free foreign exchange. The FTP this  is also expected to put greater emphasis on greater utilization of the free trade agreements (FTA) and other multilateral arrangements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Apparently, during an internal study conducted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry the rate of utilization of the FTAs is the lowest in India compared to its partner countries. As a result, the exporters lose out in the international markets with which India has such bilateral arrangements. In line with the commitments made at the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO), the FTP is expected to announce measures on how to achieve greater seamless movement of goods and services as per the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) signed last . So far in the present fiscal exports have reached $286.58 billion during AprilFebruary. Last  exports stood at $314.40 billion.',\n",
       " 'A Silk Road for China yuan 29 March 2015 Cihan News Agency (CNA) Pace of the currency internationalisation seems to be gaining momentum THE launch of HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Silk Road Fund as well as the various speeches by the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" People Bank of China on the yuan currency in the last month or so signal that the pace of yuan internationalisation seems to have gathered momentum. What are the real benefits and risks of yuan internationalisation? Basically, there are five major reasons why the yuan should be more internationalised. First, China achieved a US$10 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) status last , becoming the second largest economy in the world after the United States, if one were to exclude the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" European Union as one entity. As one of the largest trading nations in the world, China today accounts for roughly 13% of world GDP, slightly more than 10% of global trade, but turnover in the yuan in global foreign exchange (forex) markets remains still less than the Australian or Canadian dollars and way behind the greenback (roughly 60% of forex turnover), the euro (20%), the pound sterling and the yen. It seems natural that the currency of a major economy should have roughly the same share in global trading and exchange. The second reason is that since China is a major importer of commodities and exporter of consumer goods, payments and settlements in the currency of your major supplier is good for currency risk management for both buyers and sellers. With the growing sophistication of Chinese financial institutions in supporting trade and the creation of a global yuan clearing and settlement system by this , transaction costs in trading through the yuan could be as cheap and robustly settled as in the dollar or the euro. Third, since China is already the largest importer of commodities, such as iron and coal, as well as crude oil, increasingly more commodities are likely to be priced in yuan and not necessarily in dollars. The Chinese would like to pay in yuan and if the sellers feel comfortable investing in yuan because of liquidity and longterm returns, there is no reason why some of the key commodities will not be priced in yuan. Fourth, yuan internationalisation is good for China as a reform driver. Major reforms in China have historically come from \"reverse pressure\", not just from internal needs, but because China becomes more engaged in global affairs and becomes subject to global standards and rules. The move to join the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO) in 2001, which required huge internal adjustments and concessions to comply with HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO rules, was initially considered by many within China as a \"sellout\" but China was a major beneficiary from joining HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO in terms of both trade and investments. Hence, yuan internationalisation, which will require more capital account liberalisation, internal reforms in interest rate and exchange rate liberalisation, and more liquidity and competitiveness in domestic banking, insurance and capital markets, are seen to be good not only for China, but also for global financial markets. Fifth, and this is not obvious to many observers, there is an imperative for the yuan to join the international reserve currency group, such as the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" International Monetary Fund (HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" IMF) Special Drawing Rights\\' component currencies. Some people think that China wants this for the prestige, but in reality if China does not join soon, the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" IMF and the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Bank will not have enough liquidity to deal with the coming global financial crisis. Global financial assets have risen to roughly US$275 trillion (not counting derivatives), roughly 3 world GDP, mainly because, as the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" McKinsey Global Institute recently pointed out, global leverage is growing faster than GDP. At the same time, the central banks\\' balance sheets have ballooned to nearly 8% of total financial assets, mainly because of quantitative easing by the advanced central banks, primarily the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" US Federal Reserve,HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" European Central Bank and the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Bank of Japan. Because central banks lend against collateral, a lot of the socalled riskfree bonds are tied up in central banks. Liquidity in such sovereign debt has become more volatile, as the large global banks are required to maintain higher capital for them even to marketmake in these assets. As the emerging market debt begins to rise in the face of higher real interest rates, more volatile capital flows and geopolitical risks, it would not be surprising if in the next decade there is another round of financial market spikes, if not outright crash. Currently, the Bretton Wood twins, the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Bank and the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" IMF have total balance sheets of US$800bil (or slightly more than 3% of global financial assets). Since the US and European members, which control the majority shares of the multilateral institutions are unwilling to increase their capital because of fiscal constraints, these safety nets will not have enough money to deal with impending financial crises that require more and more funding to resolve. China Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road strategies, plus the AIIB, BRICS Bank and the Silk Road Fund are all attempts to fulfil the global need for infrastructure spending, improving trade and global liquidity in the event of another shock to the system. Thus, for the United States to openly lobby against their creation and membership is a little bit like cutting one nose to spite one face. Getting yuan totally internationalised is likely to be a long and tortuous road. After all, it took the US dollar 70  to overtake the pound sterling, emerging as the dominant currency backed by an overwhelming dominant military force after the World War II. One cannot but reflect that the yen challenged the dollar in the 1990s, only for the euro to overtake it as the number two reserve currency in the last decade. Was it pure coincidence that both economies got into crises because their internal structures were not ready to take the stresses and strains of internationalisation? In other words, the road to yuan internationalisation will not be smooth as Silk, but it could come sooner and in more different ways than most people think.',\n",

       " 'SROs drain out fiscal revenue collection: WTO 29 March 2015 Business Recorder (Pakistan) The HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO) has  the prevalence of Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) a discretionary measure for providing tax and tariff exemption to vested interests significantly drains out fiscal revenue collection of the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). This has been mentioned in the latest report, prepared for the fourth Trade Policy Review of Pakistan2015 by the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO Secretariat. It  that, although the FBR website indicates that a number of SROs have been rescinded in 2014; the system of SROs continues to hamper transparency. It  the tariff rates are amended annually at budget time and approved by the Parliament in the Finance Act. The FBR determines annual tariff rates in collaboration with key ministries, including finance; commerce; and industries & production. It also receives tariff recommendations from the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" National Tariff Commission (NTC), in particular reference to protection of indigenous industry, improving competitiveness and promoting exports from Pakistan. It  the government has general authority to apply tariff exemptions/concessions, and to add or modify import rules, the latter being issued by the FBR as SROs, which are approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet. Exemptions and partial exemptions provided for industries under the SRO regime are a central source of deviation from the MFN rates. Transparency, and therefore analysis, of the level and structure of Pakistan\\' tariffs has made greatly complicated the large number of exemptions and partial exemptions which are announced separately through SROs and do not affect the customs duty rate shown in the customs duty column of the tariff schedule. Other SROs further specify whether specific products are exempted from sales and other domestic taxes, as well as rules and ordinances affecting imports. Although available on the FBR website, separate SROs make it difficult to discern the applicable taxes and other measures imposed on individual tariff items which may be covered under multiple SROs. Often, SROs provide the exemptions for inputs for certain industrial sectors. By confining regulations to select sectors these exemptions operate as a de facto licensing scheme. The 201415 budget exercise included the withdrawal of three major SROs, ie, 565(I) 2006, 575(I)/2006 and, 567(I) 2006 as well as the elimination of concessions available to 89 industrial sectors, it added. It  that since the last review, the most prominent exemptions applicable to the industrial sector were provided in three SROs accounting for 23 percent of Pakistan\\' imports in 200910.On average, companies or industries under these three SRO provisions receive concessions up to around 11 percentage points from the statutory rates, applied nonuniformly across the industries. In addition, a comprehensive scheme of exemptions in the automotive sector, which discriminates by type of market (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) versus aftersales parts), is implemented under SRO 656(I)/2006, autovendors under SRO 655(I)/2006 and SRO 693(I)/2006. Although the FBR website indicates that a number of SRO have been rescinded in 2014, the system of SROs continues to hamper transparency. It remains difficult to provide a clear picture of which concessions/exemptions continue to operate and to assess their incidence. The extent to which new exemptions and concessions extend, replace or duplicate previous ones are often unclear as is the number of amendments that have been made to some of these SROs. Their use makes the tariff regime complex and less transparent. By altering the structure of tariff incentives unpredictably, with uncertain effects on resource allocation, these concessions and exemptions may counteract economic efficiency by raising tariff and increasing effective rates of protection. 3.28. The cost of exemptions and concessions as a result of importrelated SROs amounted to Rs 137 billion during the financial  201314. It is worth noting that Pakistan is committed to eliminate most tax or customs tariff exemptions or concessions granted through SROs and to approve legislation by endDecember 2015 to permanently prohibit the practice as part of the request for financial assistance from the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" IMF. The FBR maintains lists of active SROs for both imports and exports. In the case of imports some 92 SROs remain active. It has been estimated that out of this overall number, some 38 active traderelated concessionary SROs, introduced between 1991 and 2010 hamper t?rade, increase the cost of doing business and breed malpractice. The regime is complex, discriminatory and lacks transparency.',\n",
       " 'Ban on import of wheat products lifted 29 March 2015 Business Recorder (Pakistan) The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has lifted ban on import of wheat products and enhanced Regulatory Duty (RD) from 20 to 25 per cent on wheat and wheat products to support the local market as well as to allay the concerns of HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (WTO) regarding complete ban on import of wheat products. Sources told Business Recorder here on Saturday that the ECC had earlier imposed complete ban on the import of wheat products. The decision was taken to support the local market after taking into consideration huge stocks of wheat was available with the government. However, the wheat products include a wide array of items which are used by the local industry. The items under the wheat products were needed to be specified and only those specific items were required to be regulated which have a direct bearing on local wheat stocks and market. Moreover, this would also satisfy and cover the WTO concerns with regard to imposition of complete ban on the import of wheat products. The National Food Security and Research Division recommended the proposals to ECC for lifting the ban on import of wheat products and imposing 25pc RD on the import of wheat flour and enhancing the rate of RD from 20 to 25pc on wheat and wheat products to protect local farmers. The ECC considered the proposal on March 18, 2015 for imposing 25pc RD on the import of wheat flour, Maida and Semolina and approved lifting of ban on import of wheat products, imposed 25pc RD on import of wheat flour (PCT 1101.0010), Maida (PCT 1102.9000) and Semolina (PCT 1102.9000); and enhanced RD rate from 20 to 25pc on wheat and wheat products in order to protect local farmers.',\n",
       " 'Removing trade barriers for Vietnam agriculture 29 March 2015 Thai News Service Section: Business News Deputy Head of the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA) Nguyen Phuong Nam recently  that businesses in the agriculture sector need to be more diligent in opening new markets and breaking down nontariff barriers. Doing so will enable these businesses to improve their incomes, better support their families, grow the Vietnamese economy and elevate the national MadeinVietnam brand,  Nam. The largest proportion of nontariff barriers encountered by agro businesses to date have related to phytosanitary measures dealing with adherence to regulations ensuring food security and preventing the spread of disease. The number one problem agriculture and seafood businesses faced resulted from the failure to pay sufficient attention to the quarantine process and food hygiene and safety regulations, Nam  at a recent interview with a VOV reporter. Businesses need to clearly understand that if they do not comply with these regulations; their products will not be allowed to be sold in foreign markets, he , adding that they must innovate and bring their cultivation and breeding methods in compliance. Nam  the second biggest proportion of nontariff barriers businesses have experienced involved technical matters related to compliance with often complex product labelling requirements. Even more significant is the fact that agriculture businesses have failed to fully grasp the HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" World Trade Organisation (HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/ha/,DanaInfo=.agmqeeqFmil3t7nNr43,SSL+default.aspx\" WTO) dispute resolution process for matters related to alleged violations of the phytosanitary or product labelling requirements. Thus when lawsuits were filed they failed to realise that time was of the essence and that they were required to file a timely response in order to protect their rights. Most often the failure to timely respond has resulted in a preliminary presumption that the complaint lodged against them was valid. If these businesses do not raise their awareness of the legal requirements to do business in foreign markets and initiate policies and procedures to assure they are in full compliance with them, then they stand to lose their right to do business in those markets, Nam underscored. They will lose the right because the foreign market will impose substantial tariffs on their exports making it cost prohibitive to do business at a profit. It will also reflect negatively on and destroy the international reputation of the MadeinVietnam brand, Nam . First and foremost before carrying on any business in foreign markets, agricultural businesses should establish an in house legal department staffed with high first rate lawyers and legal clerks who understand the laws of the proposed market. Secondly they should seek the assistance of outside counsel in the foreign market to insure they understand the intricacies of the law as it relates to their business and put in place a management control system to ensure those requirements are fully communicated to the businesses management team. Lastly, Nam  that businesses must be proactive and take the initiative to work with relevant governmental agencies, particularly the VCA, and other nonprofit organisations to ensure they have met all the necessary requirements to conduct business in the foreign market.',\n",

The EU reimposed the duties as high as 74.1 percent on imports from China of iron or steel fasteners, used for everything from automotive parts to furniture. The levies target Chinese exporters such as GemYear Industrial Co. for allegedly having sold the fasteners in Europe below cost, a practice known as dumping. “There is a likelihood that, if measures were to lapse, dumping would recur,” the European Commission, the 28nation EU trade authority in Brussels,  on Friday in the Official Journal. The five renewal will take effect on March 28. The EU imposed the antidumping protection for five  in January 2009 to curb competition for European fastener manufacturers such as Italy Fontana Luigi SpA, prompting the Chinese government to file its first complaint against the bloc at the WTO. In December 2010, the Genevabased global trade arbiter ruled against aspects of the European measures and gave the EU specific remedies. As a response, the EU in October 2012 reduced the levies to a maximum 74.1 percent from as high as 85 percent. The revised duties range from 22.9 percent to 74.1 percent, depending on the Chinese company. Chinese Exporters In mid2011, amid the dispute with China at the WTO, the EU concluded that Chinese exporters of fasteners had shipped them to Europe via Malaysia to evade the trade protection. As a result, the bloc extended the maximum levy to Malaysia—a move that also covered by the five renewal. Chinese exports of fasteners to the EU have almost evaporated since the antidumping duties were introduced. Chinese producers’ share of the EU market has been no more than 0.6 percent since 2010, compared with 26 percent in the 12 months through September 2007, the commission  on Friday. The measures don't apply to stainless steel screws and bolts from China. The EU applies a separate set of antidumping duties on those goods.\",\n",
       " \"SROs drain out fiscal revenue collection: WTO SOHAIL SARFRAZ 29 March 2015 Business Recorder The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has  the prevalence of Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) a discretionary measure for providing tax and tariff exemption to vested interests significantly drains out fiscal revenue collection of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). This has been mentioned in the latest report, prepared for the fourth Trade Policy Review of Pakistan2015 by the WTO Secretariat. It  that, although the FBR website indicates that a number of SROs have been rescinded in 2014; the system of SROs continues to hamper transparency. It  the tariff rates are amended annually at budget time and approved by the Parliament in the Finance Act. The FBR determines annual tariff rates in collaboration with key ministries, including finance; commerce; and industries & production. It also receives tariff recommendations from the National Tariff Commission (NTC), in particular reference to protection of indigenous industry, improving competitiveness and promoting exports from Pakistan. It  the government has general authority to apply tariff exemptions/concessions, and to add or modify import rules, the latter being issued by the FBR as SROs, which are approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet. Exemptions and partial exemptions provided for industries under the SRO regime are a central source of deviation from the MFN rates. Transparency, and therefore analysis, of the level and structure of Pakistan' tariffs has made greatly complicated the large number of exemptions and partial exemptions which are announced separately through SROs and do not affect the customs duty rate shown in the customs duty column of the tariff schedule. Other SROs further specify whether specific products are exempted from sales and other domestic taxes, as well as rules and ordinances affecting imports. Although available on the FBR website, separate SROs make it difficult to discern the applicable taxes and other measures imposed on individual tariff items which may be covered under multiple SROs. Often, SROs provide the exemptions for inputs for certain industrial sectors. By confining regulations to select sectors these exemptions operate as a de facto licensing scheme. The 201415 budget exercise included the withdrawal of three major SROs, ie, 565(I) 2006, 575(I)/2006 and, 567(I) 2006 as well as the elimination of concessions available to 89 industrial sectors, it added. It  that since the last review, the most prominent exemptions applicable to the industrial sector were provided in three SROs accounting for 23 percent of Pakistan' imports in 200910.On average, companies or industries under these three SRO provisions receive concessions up to around 11 percentage points from the statutory rates, applied nonuniformly across the industries. In addition, a comprehensive scheme of exemptions in the automotive sector, which discriminates by type of market (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) versus aftersales parts), is implemented under SRO 656(I)/2006, autovendors under SRO 655(I)/2006 and SRO 693(I)/2006. Although the FBR website indicates that a number of SRO have been rescinded in 2014, the system of SROs continues to hamper transparency. It remains difficult to provide a clear picture of which concessions/exemptions continue to operate and to assess their incidence. The extent to which new exemptions and concessions extend, replace or duplicate previous ones are often unclear as is the number of amendments that have been made to some of these SROs. Their use makes the tariff regime complex and less transparent. By altering the structure of tariff incentives unpredictably, with uncertain effects on resource allocation, these concessions and exemptions may counteract economic efficiency by raising tariff and increasing effective rates of protection. 3.28. The cost of exemptions and concessions as a result of importrelated SROs amounted to Rs 137 billion during the financial  201314. It is worth noting that Pakistan is committed to eliminate most tax or customs tariff exemptions or concessions granted through SROs and to approve legislation by endDecember 2015 to permanently prohibit the practice as part of the request for financial assistance from the IMF. The FBR maintains lists of active SROs for both imports and exports. In the case of imports some 92 SROs remain active. It has been estimated that out of this overall number, some 38 active traderelated concessionary SROs, introduced between 1991 and 2010 hamper trade, increase the cost of doing business and breed malpractice. The regime is complex, discriminatory and lacks transparency.\",\n",
       " \"Australia May Introduce More Rigorous Country Of Origin Labeling Rules By Murray Griffin WTO Reporter, March 30, 2015 March 27 — Government ministers are due to consider within the next week a proposal to amend country of origin labeling rules so that consumers receive more detailed information on the proportion of Australian ingredients in the foods that they purchase. Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who has been involved in the ministerial discussions, March 27 told Bloomberg BNA by email that the government will ensure that its new approach “will be in accordance with our trade obligations under the WTO.” Industry and Science Minister Ian Macfarlane, who with Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce is developing a submission that will go before the Cabinet by the end of this month, March 25 told parliament that there was overwhelming support for rules changes. “We know that consumers want a labeling system implemented that they can actually understand,” he . “\\u2009‘Made in Australia from local and imported goods' means absolutely nothing on a label.” “We know we also must comply with WTO and international trade rules,” Macfarlane . “Again, there is going to have to be some hard work involved in that. That is why there is a ministerial working group on this.” Macfarlane  that the government would undertake extensive market research and consultation before implementing any changes. “What we are going to be doing over the ensuing months is making sure that we can bring this all together. It is not a simple process. If it were simple, someone would have fixed it already.” Macfarlane earlier in the month told parliament that the government would likely test new requirements comprising a symbol with wording that clearly defines that a product is made and processed in Australia and contains a percentage—100 percent, more than 50 percent or less than 50 percent—of Australian food. Two Bills Introduced Work on overhauling country of origin rules is partly a response to an October 2014 report issued by a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry, which recommended extensive changes. The issue shot to prominence in February, after a Hepatitis A outbreak linked to frozen berries imported from China. Meanwhile, nongovernment senators—senators who are not in the majority party—have in recent weeks proposed two bills that would tighten country of origin labeling. Australian Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne February 12 introduced the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Australian Country of Origin Food Labeling) Bill 2015. And on March 26, the Greens and independent senators cosponsored a bill with the more modest aim of removing an exemption from country of origin labeling that currently applies to fresh fish offered for immediate consumption. Debate over country of origin labeling has also triggered concern among some politicians about the potential impact of any TransPacific Partnership (TPP) agreement on efforts to provide more label information on Australian content. Kelvin Thomson, a member of the Labor opposition, March 26 expressed concern in the House of Representatives that the TPP might constrain efforts to introduce more rigorous country of origin labeling requirements.\",\n",
       " 'Country of Origin Labelling is being fought in World Trade Organisation court between the US, Canada and Mexico Sarina Locke 30 March 2015 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News As Australia reforms country of origin labelling, the US, Canada and Mexico are locked in a fight worth billions over trade access. As Australia looks to reform country of origin labelling, America and Canada are locked in dispute over the issue at the World Trade Organisation. In strict economic terms, there is evidence in the United States that the labelling reform costs outweigh the benefits, as consumers usually base their decision on price. In the US smaller beef producers, who thought cheap imports were hurting their business, successfully pushed for mandatory country of origin labelling six  ago. But not everyone in the beef industry agreed and it was fought internally for , by beef processors. Professor at Montana State University Department of Agricultural Economics Dr Gary Brester,  consumers were not that interested in where there food was produced. \"There no question when you have these sorts of labelling things that costs rise,\" he . \"So the question is, \\'will demand for locally sourced US fresh product provide a high enough premium to offset the costs of doing the labelling?\\' \"The American Meat Institute and processors say no. \"In essence it will hurt the entire industry.\" Now the US country of origin labelling laws are stuck in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), taken to court by Canada as discriminatory, because the US is the major market for Canadian exports. \"The WTO ruled in favour of Canada, now there is an appeal from the US that it was an improper ruling,\" Dr Brester . \"Canada exports the majority, about 50 per cent of their beef to the United States and they argue this is putting undue costs on their industry, and it causing a lack of competition, it unfair advantage given to US producers.\" American pork producers fear retaliation The case in the WTO is so worrying for American pork producers that they are urging Congress to back down, fearing retaliation by Canada and Mexico, as they can legally impose import tariffs on pork and beef. The US Pork president from Iowa told the House Agriculture Subcommittee that losing Mexican and Canadian markets valued at $2.4 billion, could cost 16,000 American jobs. Dr Brester has written several papers analysing the costbenefit of country of origin labelling. \"Since 2009 we now have data and the question is, \\'Do consumers pay more for US labelled beef products and how much more?\\',\" he . \"The answer is they don\\'t pay any more. \"It sounds good, but the reality is the costs are higher than what consumers are willing to pay. \"We have seen that on almost everything; tools from China or Taiwan. People don\\'t pay attention. \"Clothing is labelled by country of origin but do any of us really check? A few might, but most don\\'t.\" What Australian shoppers want Australian food manufacturers have struggled to compete with cheap imports, many fruit and vegetable processors have ceased operations and shifted to New Zealand, China and SouthEast Asia. We buy frozen potato chips from the Netherlands where farmers are heavily subsidised and tinned tomatoes from Italy which have been dumped here. The is the scare in frozen berries, Nannas and Creative Gourmet, processed in China. Australian farmers  they want clearer labels, and particular reform to the \"Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients\". The Prime Minister was pushed to back clear country of origin labels and now Federal Cabinet has ordered research into various options, consumer tested, to be ready by August. The Australian Food and Grocery Council  it is keen to see reforms to country of origin labelling, but it is also worried about any retaliatory action by Australian trading partners in the court of world trade, the WTO. The council  origin information was identified as a top three driver by 11 to 17 per cent of grocery buyers, although 61 per cent of respondents regularly check country of manufacture. CoOL is therefore an , but secondary, driver of purchasing decisions. What drives Australian shoppers is price, then taste, then brand. During the US debate on country of origin labelling, opponents  it would cost billions to implement. Dr Brester  it was hard to estimate, but the reality was the demand was not there for this labelling scheme. \"As an economist, and one interested in the cost of living, one should always evaluate the relative costs of doing something, versus the benefits,\" he . \"It sounds like the right thing to do, c\\'mon how would it be bad to know where the food comes from? \"But if you recognise it is costly, you\\'re not adding to economic progress.\"',\n",
       " \"Trade experts steer new course for developing Commonwealth countries 30 March 2015 PACNEWS, the Pacific News Agency Service MALTA, March 30 Commonwealth trade experts and senior government officials have issued a set of recommendations to advance the trade interests of least developed countries, small states and subSaharan Africa. The newlyestablished Commonwealth Expert Group on Trade met for the first time in Malta from 25 to 26 March to consider the trade challenges faced by these countries. Participants reviewed recent developments in global trade, including the changing dynamics of trade as a result of the rise of emerging economies; the increasing share of SouthSouth trade; and the growing prominence of megatrading blocs. Presenting research on trade growth in small states in particular, Dr Mohammad Razzaque, the Commonwealth Head of International Trade Policy, noted the weakening relationship between growth of GDP and growth of trade. Dr Razzaque  this raised serious concerns about the external competitiveness and effective participation in global trade for the 31 small states of the Commonwealth. Participants recommended mobilising more aid for trade and exploring opportunities for valueadded exportables to improve the trading position of small states. They also agreed to promote inclusive negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to ensure capacityconstrained countries are included. Janet Strachan, Interim Director of the Economic Policy Division, emphasised that the new forum provided an  platform to consider the trade interests of developing Commonwealth countries in the post2015 agenda. She : 'This Commonwealth Expert Group on Trade meeting is a timely event to identify priorities for our members, and for the global community to take cognisance of promoting the role of trade in an inclusive development process.' Experts agreed trade could be a significant driver in achieving post2015 goals, but for this to happen the current development framework would have to undergo reform. They called for greater assistance to help developing countries identify the links between trade and the Sustainable Development Goals to enable them to articulate their needs. The group heard a presentation on the current status and emerging trends in the Doha Development Agenda and WTO negotiations. Participants agreed to take forward a number actions, such as advocating for adequate resources for aid for trade and identifying offensive and defensive interests in trade negotiations. Case studies, presented by member states, detailed regional and countryspecific trade experiences across the Commonwealth. One participant observed that assistance provided by the Commonwealth Secretariat had facilitated a successful trade policy review by the WTO, and had allowed a better understanding of the potential benefits of a multilateral trading system....

       " 'Pakistan Farmers Challenge GI tag for Basmati rice 30 March 2015 New India Express Chennai: The Intellectual Properties Appellate Board (IPAB), Chennai, has adjourned to July 8 the hearing on an application filed by a Pakistanbased farmers organisation challenging the grant of geographical indication (GI) tag for Basmati rice to certain India areas in the Himalayan foothills spread between Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The Basmati Growers Association from Lahore has challenged the GI tag secured by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Exports Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous body under the Commerce Ministry, for the himalayan foothill areas located in India. The GI tag would mean that rice produced in any other areas cannot be marketed as Basmati, as per international trade treaties. While the appeal was dismissed by Assistant Registrar, GI, on December 31, 2013, it has now filed the appeal in the board at Chennai. In its petition, the BGA contended that Basmati was name for slender, aromatic and long grain variety of rice grown in specific geographical areas in the foothills of Himalayas in Pakistan. These parts of IndoGangetic plain are traditional Basmati rice yielding areas. The organisation referred to Punjab poet Syed Waris Shah’s master piece ‘Heer’ in which he mentions about Basmati grown in Punjab those days, whose areas now fall within the jurisdiction of Pakistan. The petition  Basmati is protected under section 24 (9) of Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). BGA has contended that the GI tag for India areas would affect farmers in Pakistan, who are the legitimate cultivators of Basmati traditionally. Shafiullah Khan of Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, had filed the petition on behalf of BGA. When the case came up for hearing in February last week, the IPAB bench comprising the board’s chairman Justice K N Basha adjourned the matter to July 8.',\n",
       " 'Japan calls on Obama to step up personal involvement in TPP deal Robin Harding in Tokyo 30 March 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) Japan economy minister has called on US President Barack Obama to ramp up his lobbying of Democrats to secure congressional authority for the TransPacific Partnership, as the mammoth trade deal approaches a makeorbreak deadline in the next few months. The rare direct appeal by Akira Amari, the Japanese minister responsible for the talks, shows how nerves on both sides of the Pacific are fraying as the effective deadline for a deal draws close. \"I\\'ve always thought it was  that President Obama not leave this in the hands of others, and that he should make direct efforts to convince and persuade,\"  Mr Amari in an interview with the Financial Times. \"We are getting into real time constraints, but there still a good possibility of a deal with President Obama, so I\\'m optimistic,\"  Mr Amari. \"I\\'ve heard the president has started making efforts to persuade Democrats and that gives me hope.\" Failure of the TPP would be a huge blow to governments in the US and Japan. For Mr Obama, it is one of the few measures he may be able to get past a Republican Congress; while for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the TPP is both a goal in itself and a tool to force deregulation of domestic sectors such as agriculture. The TPP would liberalise trade among 12 Pacific nations, including Japan and the US, covering about 40 per cent of global output. Negotiations have been under way for almost seven . But to close the deal, Mr Obama needs to secure Trade Promotion Authority, a fasttrack route through Congress. \"Once a TPA bill is submitted to Congress then we can enter a resolution mode on some of the outstanding issues between Japan and the United States,\"  Mr Amari. He  the current bestcase scenario is to reach a basic agreement in May, with the outlines visible when Mr Abe visits Washington on April 28th. Negotiators have signalled that while there are outstanding issues, a deal on the substance is within reach. However, there is a narrow window for TPA which closes when the US Congress leaves town at the end of July. After that, US officials fear a vacuum before the US presidential campaigns kick into high gear in 2016. Even though the Republicans control both houses of Congress and strongly back free trade in principle, opposition from unionbacked Democrats and deep antipathy between Mr Obama and congressional Republicans makes it hard to get TPA to the finish line. In the Senate, the hurdle is Oregon senator Ron Wyden, who as ranking Democrat on the finance committee is essential to passing a bipartisan TPA bill. In the House, the task is to fashion a centrist majority. A significant number of leftwing Democrats are likely to vote No, as are some isolationist Republicans, who are loath to give Mr Obama any kind of victory. \"I\\'ve met the leaders of the Republican party and what has come across is that, even with a Democratic president, they recognise the importance of TPP,\"  Mr Amari.',\n",

The AIIB, seen as a challenge to existing institutions the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, has drawn a cool response from the United States, despite which European U.S. allies including Britain, France, Germany and Italy have already announced they would join the bank. Other countries such as Turkey and South Korea have also  they would join. Brazil, China top trading partner,  on Friday it would sign up and that there were no conditions set. \"Brazil is very interested in participating in this initiative,\" the office of President Dilma Rousseff  in a statement. Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, speaking on Saturday at a forum in Boao on the southern Chinese island of Hainan,  the country plans to join the AIIB, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Speaking at the same forum, Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann  the country was planning to apply to become a founding member, according to Xinhua, while later on Saturday the news agency confirmed that Georgia had also applied. The Netherlands also plans to join, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte  on his official Facebook page after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China Finance Ministry  earlier on Saturday Britain and Switzerland had been formally accepted as founding members of the AIIB, a day after Brazil accepted China invitation to join.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) new BusinesstoConsumer (B2C) ecommerce businesses selling to the general public index, which surveyed 130 economies, covers countries on four indicators of internet use, secure servers, credit card penetration and postal delivery services. The index value is strongly correlated to the variation in the share of individuals shopping online. India scores 40.6 on index value with 1.8 per cent individuals over 15  owning a credit card (2011 data), 12.6 per cent using the internet (2013 data), 48.2 secure servers per million people and 100 per cent population having mail delivered at home. \"India is quite far down and you can see why because you have low levels of credit card use.

       " 'EGA Product List Nearly Ready; Parties Set Format For Scope Negotiations World Trade Online Posted: March 30, 2015 The United States and other participants in the talks for an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) have paved the way to begin substantive negotiations in May on which products will ultimately subject to tariff elimination. They have done so by setting Wednesday (April 1) as the deadline for participants to come forward with their final product nominations, and by agreeing on the format for conducting the negotiations on product scope, sources . The 17 EGA members have spent the last eight months submitting product nominations based on 10 broad categories of goods related to the environment. The April 1 deadline is aimed at wrapping up that process so that EGA members can spend the following month consolidating the list and eliminating duplicates, before beginning the product scope negotiation at their next round, slated for May 48 in Geneva. In terms of the format of that negotiation, EGA members have agreed to individually examine each of the roughly 600 tariff lines that has been proposed, and gauge the support among the membership for its inclusion in a final deal, sources . During this process they will also examine the socalled “environmental credibility” of each product, which refers to its contribution to environmental protection or conservation. EGA members have not developed any general criteria for determining a product environment credibility, and will therefore examine it on a casebycase basis, sources . One Geneva source  EGA members are considering starting with the highestnumbered tariff lines in the Harmonized System (HS) and working their away down. To help speed up the process of considering and negotiating each tariff line, EGA members will also group together any tariff lines that are related to each other, sources . For instance, members could consider tariff lines connected with lightemitting diodes (LEDs) all at once, even though they would normally be located in various HS chapters, according to one Geneva source. But even if members decide to group these lines together, the decision on whether the lines should be liberalized will still be done on a linebyline basis, another Geneva source . This source  EGA members will begin this linebyline analysis at the May round, but will not make any final decision at that meeting as to whether these products will be in or out. He indicated that EGA members would repeat this linebyline process at least two more times before finalizing the list. This source  EGA members would not discuss he length of tariff phaseout periods during the May round. EGA members appear to have attached different degrees of weight to the April 1 deadline for submit all remaining product nominations. The United States in particular is pushing for it to be a hard deadline for all countries except the three that joined the EGA in the last few months: Israel, Turkey and Iceland. By contrast, other EGA members see it as soft deadline after which any participant would still be able to submit additional product nominations, sources . “April 1 is the deadline for product nominations, with flexibility being provided for new members,” a spokesman for the Office for the U.S. Trade Representative  in a March 27 email to Inside U.S. Trade. “Most EGA members have nominated products in this process thus far, and we expect new members will also nominate products soon.” EGA members during the fifth round of talks in Geneva March 1620 discussed product nominations for the final three environmental categories that they agreed on at the outset of the talks environmental monitoring, analysis and assessment; environmentally preferable products; and resource efficiency. According to a March 27 press release from the Norwegian mission to the WTO, Norway nominated nine tariff lines in the category of environmentally preferable products. Its nominations included bamboo construction materials and pumps that are powered by renewable energy. Environmental credibility is one of three potential hurdles in the EGA talks that have been highlighted by Geneva sources as well as Simon Newnham, ministercounselor for trade at the Australian Embassy in Washington. Australia is the permanent chair of the EGA talks. The others are how to address socalled “dualuse” goods, which have both environmental and nonenvironmental applications, or how to assuage fears by some countries that lowering tariffs under the EGA could amount to them giving up leverage in the Doha round negotiations on industrial tariffs. One Geneva source  that, like environmental credibility, EGA members will address these two issues as they arise in the linebyline negotiations on product scope. “All of those issues … will be part of the discussions as we go through linebyline,” the source . “How we resolve all of them will be done on a casebycase basis.” Some environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the World Wildlife Fund have criticized the EGA on the grounds that some of the products under discussion may not be environmentally friendly or produced responsibly. One way EGA members attempted to address this criticism was by bringing in experts to describe the environmental impact of specific products under consideration. For instance, Norway invited Professor Edgar Hertwich, the director of industrial ecology program at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, to give a presentation on resource efficiency at the round, according to the Norwegian mission press release. Similarly, EGA members are not being specific on how to address other challenges that could arise in the talks, like how to address socalled “dualuse” goods, which have both environmental and nonenvironmental applications, or how to assuage fears that lowering tariffs through the EGA could amount to countries giving up leverage in the Doha round negotiations on industrial tariffs. One Geneva source  these issues would be addressed as they came up.',\n",
       " \"Russia, EU Officials Spar at WTO Over African Swine Fever Spread By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, March 31, 2015 March 30 — Russia and the European Union officials at a recent World Trade Organization committee meeting continued to cast blame for failing to contain the spread of African Swine Fever (ASF). During the meeting of the Committee on Santiary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures, Russia  ASF is spreading significantly in EU border states—like Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Estonia—and faulted the EU for failing to contain the disease. Russia  the number of declared ASF cases now stands at 330, a marked increase from the 131 cases reported at the committee last meeting of 2014 (202 WTO, 10/20/14). EU trade officials  they “did not appreciate the tone of Russia criticisms,” according to a WTO official. The EU further  it would not engage in a debate on Russia statement since the matter was currently the subject of a dispute settlement inquiry. Negative Outlook Rosselkhoznadzor, the Russian agricultural agency,  the EU is underestimating the spread of the disease and shifting the blame to Russia and Belarus, according to a recent news release. The EU failure to contain the disease is due, in part, to a lack of transparency in its reporting of ASF infections and the EU different SPS standards and definitions, Rosselkhoznadzor . Russia  it had conducted an open and continued participation in reporting ASF cases despite the EU reluctance to exchange information about infections within its territories. Russian officials previously cited the political disagreement related to EU sanctions against Russian goods for its negative impact on a potential resolution of swine fever outbreaks. Private Standards Members of the SPS committee meeting were unable to agree on a working definition for SPSrelated private safety standards due to certain members' concerns about how it could impact their trade policies. The issue has gained steam in recent  as large retailers and supermarkets in certain developed countries—like Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan and the U.S.—imposed private standards on products like fresh fruit and vegetables, and fresh, chilled or frozen meat. Since 2011, members have sought and failed to agree on principles that would help them navigate such private standards. Many African, Latin American and Caribbean countries have noted the impact of high costs the standards have on their exports. A working definition on how to deal with private standards is intended as a framework to limit the scope of issues considered by the committee, rather than a formal requirement, Committee Chairwoman, Lillian Bwalya of Zambia . Bwalya suggested members undergo a “cooling off” period to consider how to overcome the impasse. Brazil Felipe Hees will take over from Bwalya as chairman of the SPS committee at its next meeting July 1516.\",\n",
       " 'SA pulled out of WTO treaty over bill, security industry says 31Mar2015 | Khulekani Magubane Bdlive The bill creates a system of compulsory indigenisation of private security companies with no compensation, warns law firm THE realisation that the contentious Private Security Industry Regulation Amendment Bill would not pass scrutiny by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is what prompted the government to pull out of the body’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats). This is the claim of international trade analysts and leaders in the private security industry who spoke at a media briefing on Monday. Section 20 of the draft law stipulates that all private security companies relinquish 51% of their South African units to local ownership. This comes after Police Minister Nathi Nhleko  last week that SA would withdraw from its commitments under Gats to consult WTO member states over the private security bill. Mr Nhleko also explained that a committee would be assembled to adjudicate applications for partial exemption made by foreignowned private security companies. The committee would include representatives of the Civilian Secretariat for Police, the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, as well as the Departments of Trade and Industry, Home Affairs and International Relations. The Security Industry Alliance (SIA) is opposing the bill, saying foreignowned security companies, including G4S, Securitas and ADT, would be subjected to compulsory expropriation without compensation if the bill is passed into law. Webber Wentzel director Peter Leon  on Monday that the bill created a system of compulsory indigenisation of private security companies with no compensation. He  \"it has vague conditions for exemptions for companies\" but it \"didn’t say companies will be exempted on a retrospective basis\". \"You can’t pick and choose when it comes to the WTO. It’s a set of agreements that SA signed up to. Gats does provide for certain general exceptions, but they have to apply to article 14 and must not lead to arbitrary inhibition of trade,\" Mr Leon .

       " 'Rich nations\\' fossil fuel export funding dwarfs green spenddocuments * OECD struggling to find solution before Paris climate talks * Next OECD meeting set for June * EU also deadlocked over the issue By Barbara Lewis BRUSSELS, March 30 (Reuters) Rich nations provided around five times as much in export subsidies for fossilfuel technology as for renewable energy over a decade, according to OECD data seen by Reuters. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures on export credits are central to a debate on targeting funding ahead of U.N. climate talks in Paris at the end of the . Just when the European Union is leading the push for a new global deal on curbing emissions and is phasing out domestic coal subsidies, the documents underline the scale of the developed world investment in exporting technology for the most polluting fossil fuel. Earlier this , a document seen by Reuters provided the closest yet to official figures on coal export credits. Further documents give the context of all energy export subsidies. One, dated March 4, when the OECD held closeddoor talks on the issue, shows OECD governments provided preferential loans and statebacked guarantees worth $36.8 billion between 2003 and 2013 for exporting fossil fuel powergeneration technology, including almost $14 billion for coal. A document from October 2014 shows another $52.6 billion in export credits was allocated for the extraction of fossil fuels, including coal, taking the fossil fuel total to $89.4 billion. Export credits for technology for renewable energy, which has no extraction costs, were $16.7 billion. An OECD spokesman  he could not comment on documents marked confidential. But the documents themselves say the data should be public. \"There would seem to be a pressing need to issue coherent, complete and accurate figures on official export credit support that is relevant to climate change issues,\" the March 4 document says. EU officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,  the March talks made little progress and the issue would be raised again at OECD level in June. The OECD has  it wants a decision on how export credits can help tackle climate change in time for the U.N. summit that begins on Nov. 30 in Paris. A debate within the EU, which accounts for two thirds of OECD nations, is deadlocked because Poland has blocked as too ambitious a compromise to allow export funding for only the most efficient coal technology, the EU officials . Britain and France objected, saying the compromise was not ambitious enough. Germany, the biggest EU user of export credits both for coal and renewables, the data shows, is planning measures to make operators of coal plants, such as RWE, curb production at their oldest and mostpolluting power stations as part of efforts to achieve climate targets. A letter to the European Commission from industry associations, the European Power Plant Suppliers Association, EU Turbines and Germany VDMA,  halting coal export credits would lock developing nations into lessefficient technology and curtail European industry competitiveness. Environment campaigners dismiss those arguments. Sebastien Godinot, an economist at WWF,  the industry had \"failed to bring any concrete evidence that the OECD export finance policy drives more efficient technology\".

       " 'Taiwan, Norway seek to join Chinabacked AIIB, Japan still cautious TOKYO/TAIPEI (Reuters) Japan remains cautious about signing up to the Chinaled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), indicating that Tokyo will miss the March 31 deadline for application, but both Taiwan and Norway  they would seek to join the institution. Finance Minister Taro Aso reiterated Japan concerns about governance at the AIIB, its debt sustainability and environmental and social safeguards. \"Unless these conditions are secured, Japan has no choice but to be very cautious about joining,\" Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Taiwan sought to join the proposed development bank despite historical animosity and a lack of formal diplomatic relations between the island and China. In a statement released late on Monday, Taiwan presidential office spokesman Charles Chen  joining the AIIB will help Taiwan in its efforts at regional economic integration and raise the possibility of joining other multinational bodies. It was not immediately known whether Beijing would accept Taiwan application to join the AIIB. The bank is seen as a significant setback to U.S. efforts to extend its influence in the AsiaPacific region and balance China growing financial clout and assertiveness. Norway also  it wanted to join as a prospective founder member. \"Norway is a substantial contributor to global development efforts, and wishes to join countries from Asia and other parts of the world in further refining the structure and mission of the AIIB,\" Foreign Minister Boerge Brende  in a statement on a government website. China has set a March 31 deadline to become a founding member of the AIIB and over 40 nations have joined or  they intend to, adding clout to an institution seen as enhancing Beijing regional and global influence. Japan and the United States are the two notable absentees. The AIIB is seen as a challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank and has drawn a cool response from the United States, although many of Washington allies, including Australia, South Korea, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, have announced they would join the bank. In Taiwan, the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) protested against what it called the government unilateral decision to seek to join the AIIB. \"The AIIB is led singlehandedly by a Beijing which still promotes \\'one China\\',\" it  in a statement. China views Taiwan as a renegade province and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control. However, since Taiwan current president Ma Yingjeou took office in 2008, enmity has declined considerably and the two sides have signed a number of trade and investment deals. The DPP maintains Taiwan is a defacto independent country and adopts a much more conservative stance toward China dealings than the Nationalist Party of Ma. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognize Taiwan due to pressure from China. Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.

       " 'U.S., Japan have \"significant gaps\" on auto market access U.S. official By Daniel Bases NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) Acting Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler  on Monday that \"significant gaps\" in the trade negotiations remain between the United States and Japan regarding access for U.S. automobiles in the Japanese market. \"Japan has zero tariffs on autos and trucks, and yet access to the Japanese automotive market is limited. There is an array of nontariff barriers in Japan that have effectively closed the Japanese auto market to U.S. producers,\" Cutler  in prepared remarks on the TransPacific Partnership trade negotiations delivered at the Japan Society in New York. \"And as a result, when Japan joined the (TPP) negotiation, we asked and Japan agreed to launching a separate bilateral parallel negotiation on automotive nontarrif measure issues. And on these issues we are making good progress, but we have more work to do,\" Cutler . A Japanese negotiating team spent the prior week in Washington, working on the issue. The U.S. and Japan are part of a 12nation TPP negotiation that is expected to wrap up by mid. Cutler, whose remarks were interrupted twice by hecklers protesting the TPP, also  a second critical sticking point in bilateral trade talks with Japan is access for U.S. agricultural products. In 2014, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan totaled nearly $67 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, down 8.7 percent from 2013. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to address a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on April 29, becoming the first Japanese leader to do so while on a state visit next month. The TPP is a key part of the U.S. \"pivot\" to Asia and progress toward a deal has been touted as a key part of Abe visit. \"We are now working intensively with the Japanese to make as much progress as possible before the prime minister comes to the United States,\" Cutler . Delays in finalizing U.S. legislation to speed free trade deals through Congress is also proving to be a snag in moving forward on trade talks. The trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation allows U.S. lawmakers to set objectives for trade deals in exchange for a yesorno vote. END',\n",
       " 'Use Trade as the Next Stimulus By Roberto Azevedo 1 April 2015 The Wall Street Journal Europe For many decades trade liberalization was the oil which allowed the engine of the global economy to run ever faster and more efficiently. It facilitated the long boom that followed World War II. Exports have grown 35fold since then, thanks largely to a reduction in average tariffs to 4% from around 40% negotiated through the multilateral trading system, now embodied in the World Trade Organization. Despite this, some now question whether trade role in supporting economic growth is beginning to fade. For 50 , trade grew on average at almost twice the rate of gross domestic product, but over the past decade its growth rate has declined. This has led to the suggestion that the relentless increase in trade share of world GDP around 30% today is reaching its maximum level. Indeed, 2015 is likely to mark the fourth consecutive  of belowaverage trade growth. However, a closer look at the reasons behind these figures shows that fears of a decline in trade power to drive global growth are unjustified. Some argue that the change in trade growth is due to structural factors. For example, the rapid spread of production chains across borders that began in the 1990s appears to be decelerating. Similarly, the gains from containerization and new communications technology, both of which have facilitated trade, are stabilizing. Such structural shifts are only part of the picture. There are major cyclical factors. Demand has been dampened by slow growth or recession in the U.S. and European Union, the continued sluggish performance of Japan and the moderation of growth in emerging economies. The EU is particularly  here. It accounts for a third of world trade, but only a quarter of GDP, so any slowdown in Europe automatically has a more pronounced impact on trade. But it is possible that we are not seeing the true picture because our methods of measuring trade need to be updated. Trade in software and services is not fully captured statistically so growth in these areas, which is quite obvious to everyone from someone using a mobile phone to send money in Mombasa to the Uber customer in London, is not fully reflected. There is also the question of how to measure trade in components. Should they be counted every time they cross a border, or should the value they add to the final product be captured just once? It is clear that doublecounting doesn\\'t reflect the real contribution that trade provides to global growth. We are working with other international organizations to improve this analysis to ensure we hear the signal rather than the noise. Given these factors, any talk of \"peak trade\" or even \"deglobalization\" is rather hasty. But there is a more significant reason why fears of a decline in trade growth are unjustified, which is that it is within our control. I have been reminded recently of a line attributed to the French writer Chamfort: \"If it wasn\\'t for me, I would do brilliantly.\" We are worrying about a problem that we have the power to solve. Since the crisis, policy makers have tested to the limit options to spark economic growth. Interest rates are at historic lows, room for maneuver on fiscal policy is tight, and centralbank quantitative easing has largely run its course. But we haven\\'t yet fully explored trade potential as a stimulant of global demand. Some positive steps have been taken. WTO members struck a historic deal in Bali in 2013 that will dramatically cut trade costs and deliver an economic boost of up to $1 trillion annually. Negotiators are also working to expand the WTO Information Technology Agreement and liberalize trade in environmental goods, and many countries are pursuing regional trade agreements. All these efforts are very welcome, but we need to be more ambitious. The last major global trade agreement is now 20  old. Global deals deliver far more than any other approach. Rather than simply deepening existing trade connections, multilateral reforms allow new trading relationships to be established. Moreover, evidence shows that bringing developing countries into the world economy in a fair and progressive way is the best way to foster development and maximize the contribution of trade to global growth. Despite this, we are still living off the reforms made by the previous generation. New agreements on trade in agricultural produce, industrial goods and services could lower barriers to business and sharply reduce longstanding distortions in the trading system, thereby supporting growth and development around the world. The WTO Bali deal provided momentum to our broader global trade talks. Our next major negotiating meeting is in December in Nairobi, the first such meeting ever held in Africa. Instead of talking about trade capacity to leverage growth as mere observers, we should recognize that we can take control, and that this may be the policy option for which we have long been searching.  Mr. Azevedo is directorgeneral of the World Trade Organization.',\n",

       " 'U.S., South African Poultry Industries Struggle To Reach Deal On Duties World Trade Online Posted: March 31, 2015 The U.S. and South African poultry industries are struggling to find terms they can both agree on to end a longstanding dispute over South African antidumping (AD) duties on U.S. bonein chicken products, with South African producers resisting demands for market opening that the U.S. says are critical to regain a foothold in the market. Both Jim Sumner of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) and Kevin Lovell of the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) told Inside U.S. Trade on Tuesday (March 31) that the two sides in the last week again swapped offers on the size of a special tariffrate quota (TRQ) under which U.S. poultry would face normal South African duty rates. But despite months of talks, the two sides have still failed to find anything close to a middle ground. According to Lovell, SAPA has increased its initial offer, which it submitted in January, by “50 percent,” while the U.S. industry has only brought its offer down by 10 to 15 percent. Sumner, meanwhile, characterized the improvement in SAPA offer as a negligible change from its initial position, which he characterized as insufficient. Neither industry representative was willing to disclose specific figures. “Fifty percent of next to nothing is still not much,\" Sumner . \"Still, they are far away from what we feel we need to get back into the market as far as access levels.\" The two sides met most recently on March 6 in Atlanta, where Lovell and Sumner held informal discussions on potential offers that were put in writing later in the month. SAPA submitted its newest proposal on March 25, which USAPEEC responded to on March 30. Sumner  the U.S. response letter included an offer for the two parties to meet at a mutually agreeable place as soon as possible to continue their facetoface talks where they left off in Atlanta. According to Lovell, SAPA is hoping to respond to USAPEEC with another proposal before both he and Sumner gather in Europe for industry meetings which begin on April 11. He  he hoped to hold a meeting with Sumner and possibly reach a \"handshake\" agreement shortly after those meetings. Both U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and South African Trade Minister Rob Davies are slated to meet under their bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) that same week. According to a South African official, the TIFA meetings are scheduled from April 1517 in Washington. Lovell  Froman has also sent a letter to the South African government on the poultry issue. A spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to a request for the letter, or who in the government it was sent to, by press time. Following an agreement, Lovell , lawyers on both sides would draw up the legal text, which would then be submitted to South Africa International Trade Administration Commission. That agency would evaluate the agreement and float it for public stakeholder comments. Under the TRQ being negotiated, the U.S. exporters would be permitted to ship a certain volume of chicken at South Africa most favored nation (MFN) rate. After the volume exceeds the threshold on which the current parties are currently negotiating, the AD rate would apply to U.S. shipments. SAPA position in the talks spurred 13 U.S. Senators, including seven members of the Finance Committee, to send a March 30 letter to the South African government urging Pretoria to push its domestic industry to improve its offer. \"We urge you to continue to work with SAPA and encourage its leaders to not shut the door on negotiations,\" the letter . \"We also urge you to convey to SAPA the importance of its meeting formally with [USAPEEC] in the coming weeks to work on negotiations in real time.\" It was addressed to Davies and Faizel Ismail, the special envoy for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The senators noted the upcoming deadline to renew AGOA. Sens. Johnny Isakson (RGA) and Chris Coons (DDE) the two senators who led the letter have made it clear that they will work to strip South Africa of its AGOA benefits if the AD duties are not resolved beforehand. The senators issued their demand while also noting that an AGOA renewal bill is likely to come before Finance within the next month, a timeline that aligns with plans to introduce a Trade Promotion Authority bill. “As you know, AGOA must be reauthorized before its expiration in September. Textiles manufacturers receive orders months ahead of time for productionplanning purposes, so the earliest renewal possible is critical,” the letter . “It is likely that AGOA will come before the Senate Finance Committee in the next month, and we hope our respective industries can reach a fair compromise before that time comes.” In addition to Coons and Isakson, the letter signatories were Sens. John Boozman (RAR), Bob Casey (DPA), David Perdue (RGA), Tom Carper (DDE), Dan Coats (RIN), Mark Warner (DVA), John Cornyn (RTX), Ben Cardin (DMD), Chuck Grassley (RIA), Barbara Mikulski (DMD) and Tim Kaine (DVA).

       " \"European Commission Mulls Another 'OptOut' Proposal For GMO Imports World Trade Online Posted: March 31, 2015 The European Commission is considering giving individual European member states the power to ban the import of EUapproved genetically modified food and animal feed into their territory and may propose legislation along those lines when it completes a review of the EU biotech approval procedures at the end of April. According to member state and privatesector sources, the commission is currently circulating a document internally that includes the socalled “optout” proposal for food and feed imports. But sources  this is likely to be only one of a handful of potential changes to the procedures for the authorization of genetically modified crops that the commission will put forward in its report summarizing the review. Another potential option is not changing the authorization process at all, one parliamentary source . The commission is keeping the contents of its proposal closely held before announcing it. EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis was directed by Commission President JeanClaude Juncker to conduct a review of the authorization process for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within six months of taking office in November 2014. In a March 26 hearing before a European Parliament committee, Andriukaitis hinted that the commission is mulling giving member states at least some degree of greater say over GMO imports. “I look forward to a constructive dialogue with the parliament and ultimately to a solution that gives its fair responsibility to democratically elected governments,” he  in his opening statement, addressing the GMO approvals issue. Ahead of the April report, agrifood groups on both sides of the Atlantic have been warning the commission not to propose measures that they argue would further rip apart the single European market for food and feed products. “Any attempt to nationalize the EU decisionmaking process should be avoided,” a March 30 letter signed by 14 EU agrifood groups . “This would lead to serious threats to the EU single market and would inevitably result in upsetting the balance of EU supply for food and feed uses, regardless of whether the products are [genetically modified], conventional or organic.” In a March 12 letter to Andriukaitis U.S. agrifood and biotech groups  the commission should “not fragment the EU singlemarket for imported [GMO] crops.” The letter also urged the commission not to allow the review to further delay the approval of GMO traits that have received a positive assessment from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and are awaiting approval from the commission. On March 31, the number of import authorization applications pending before the commission increased to 17, after an appeals committee failed to reach a decision on four renewals for GMO cotton varieties. This leaves the commission with the discretion of whether to authorize imports of those crops or not. Sources  the commission is planning to approve all of these applications in one fell swoop after finishing its review process. Some speculated that the commission is attempting to clear the backlog of pending GMO traits before it introduces a new legislative proposal changing that process because it would not want to approve the traits while legislation is being negotiated. The U.S. government has also pressed Brussels to approve the traits. The idea of allowing member states the discretion to bar the import of biotech food and feed products mirrors the approach the commission put forward on the issue of GMO cultivation which was initially unveiled in 2010, but only recently adopted by the European Parliament and member states after a series of hardfought battles. Juncker has hinted that he favors this approach. Before taking office, he told the European Parliament in a speech that he did not believe the commission should be authorizing biotech traits in the face of opposition from a significant bloc of member states. “The commission should be in a position to give the majority view of democratically elected governments at least the same weight as scientific advice, notably when it comes to the safety of the food we eat and the environment in which we live,” he  in the July 2014 remarks But Arnaud Apoteker, a campaigner for the vehemently antiGMO Greens party,  in an interview with Inside U.S. Trade that compared to the cultivation issue, there is generally less of an appetite among member states, environmental groups and citizens to craft legislation that would allow a ban on biotech imports. Apoteker explained that this is both because of consumer perception and legal reasons. He noted that most imported GMO crops are used as animal feed in Europe, and thus consumers are not directly ingesting GMO products. From a legal perspective, member states feel they may have a harder time justifying a ban on imports of food and feed products, depending on how any potential legislative proposal is crafted by the commission. The cultivation proposal allowed bans to be put in place for reasons including town and country planning, environmental policy objectives and to avoid GMO crosscontamination with conventional and organic crops issues that are not directly relevant when talking about imports. The commission was adamant that health and safety reasons should not be cited in the cultivation optout proposal, since safety evaluations are the domain of EFSA. Member states may also be wary of invoking bans for fear they could run counter to the Agreement on the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures in the World Trade Organization if they cannot root their prohibitions on claims related to “sound science,” Apoteker . The Greens party, in the cultivation proposal debate, advocated for member states to be able to cite environmental and health reasons as reasons for imposing a ban on planting biotech crops in their territory. Legal matters aside, opponents of the “optout” idea say creating a patchwork of EU bans could create logistical and commercial problems as well. For example, if a coastal member state barred the import of a GMO trait, that could impede the ability of other inland member states to import that crop as well, one EU agrifood industry source . Member states that do implement a ban could also give an upper hand to domestic producers because those companies could use “GMOfree” labeling, he added. Current EU law requires food companies to label any product that contains more than 0.9 percent GMO content, although meat from animals raised on GMO grain does not have to be labeled as such. This differentiation in labeling would give the impression that products with that label are safer or more in compliant with EU laws and regulations, even if that is not the case, the industry source  echoing an argument that GMO labeling critics in the U.S. have employed. This could also effectively pressure other member states to implement a ban on GMO imports, the source added.\",\n",

Beijing has continued its ban on import of bovine meat despite signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with India on the issue two  ago during Chinese Premier Li Kequiang’s visit then. “We raised the issue at the multilateral platform as we were not getting a satisfactory response from China bilaterally. We have no intentions of going to dispute yet, but can’t comment about the future,” a Commerce Ministry official told BusinessLine . India, which has a huge trade deficit with China, calculated at over $37 billion in 201314, is hoping to sell meat worth over $1 billion annually once the ban is lifted. In a submission to the WTO agriculture committee last week, India’s representative pointed out the country was still waiting for Chinese quarantine inspectors to examine meat plants so that the facilities could be cleared for exports. Beijing, in its defence,  it had actively implemented the 2013 memorandum but technical data requested by it were not submitted by India until July 2014. The Chinese representative  that authorities in the country were making all efforts to conduct a technical analysis on the data supplied by India and will intensify work on lifting the ban. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to visit China in the coming months, will also raise the issue of unfulfilled MoUs, the official . Apart from bovine meat, MoUs have also been signed between the two countries on pharmaceuticals, fisheries and IT. “The PM will give the message that MoUs are not to be treated lightly and the ones that have been signed so far need to be implemented,” the official . Beijing has been assuring India it will try to bridge the glaring trade imbalance between the two countries by importing more, but nothing concrete has happened in the direction yet.',\n",
       " 'EU renews tariff on Chinamade fasteners for another five  Ian Fletcher 31 March 2015 IHS Global Insight Daily Analysis The European Union (EU) has renewed the tariff on screws and bolts from China for another five , reports Bloomberg News. The EU reimposed the duty at up to 74.1% on import of Chinese iron or steel fasteners used in various applications including automotive as the first five period of the duty ended. The European Commission  on 27 March in the Official Journal that, \"There is a likelihood that, if measures were to lapse, dumping would recur.\" The five renewal became effective on 28 March. The tariff does not cover Chinese screws and bolts made from stainless steel, for which the EU applies a separate set of antidumping duties. Significance: The EU imposed antidumping duty on imports of Chinamade fasteners in January 2009 to protect local fastener manufacturers from unfair competition from their Chinese counterparts, which were found to be selling fasteners in Europe below cost. The Chinese government opposed the duty through a filing made against the EU at the World Trade Organization (WTO). In December 2010, the apex trade regulatory body ruled against aspects of the European measures and gave the EU specific measures. In 2011, the EU found that Chinese exports are shipping fasteners to Europe via Malaysia to avoid tariff protection. This prompted the EU to extend the maximum levy to Malaysia for five . In October 2012, the EU reduced the levies on Chinese fasteners from 85% to 74.1%. The revised duty varies from 22.9% to 74.1% depending on the Chinese company. According to the Commission, Chinese exports of fasteners have declined sharply since antidumping measures were applied five  ago. In 2007, Chinese fasteners accounted for 26%, which dropped to 0.6% in 2010.',\n",

Canada is keen to get greater access for processed food, hydrocarbons related products, minerals, auto components and wine. The next round of talks has been tentatively scheduled for June. The proposed agreement will look at various aspects including rules of origin, trade facilitation, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and trade in services. \"The proposed CEPA will help ease a lot of regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles and help ramp up business ties between the two nations besides giving a boost to bilat eral trade,\"  Rakesh Nangia, managing partner, Nangia & Co, an advisory firm specialising in international regulations. This is among the first FTAs being negotiated by the Modi government, which took over in May last . EUIndia free trade pact talks are also expected to restart in a few months. CEPA is aimed at cutting or eliminating duties on a large number of products traded between the countries, besides opening up the services sector and facilitating investment proposals. The negotiations were launched in 2010. The two sides had eight rounds of negotiations till 2013, with India seeking movement on services, before progressing on goods. \"Canada does not have a globally competitive manufacturing sector, but has strength in agroprocessing, mineral processing, etc, which they would like India to open up for them. In services, it must be keen on construction services. In services India should look beyond Mode 4, movement of professionals and look at audio visual, education, research collaboration, etc,\"  Arpita Mukherjee, professor, Icrier.

       " 'China Tells Treasury New Banking Rules Delayed, But Details Still Murky World Trade Online Posted: April 01, 2015 The Chinese government has told U.S. Treasury Department officials that Beijing is delaying the implementation of new banking regulations that would require foreign companies supplying China financial institutions to turn over sensitive commercial information, according to a spokeswoman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. \"Treasury officials were told by the Chinese Government on Monday that the banking regulations have been delayed,” the spokeswoman told Inside U.S. Trade in an email Tuesday (March 31). But she added that there has been no official word on this matter and could offer no further details. “We are awaiting official confirmation of such a delay, and continue to seek China’s reconsideration of the approach it has taken to regulate [information and communication technology] equipment in the banking sector,” she . News of the delay coincided with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew March 30 meetings with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing. Lew indicated before his meeting with the vice premier that the cybersecurity regulations were going to be discussed. “We have already made clear our concerns regarding forced technology transfer and other attempts to bar technological competition, most recently in the banking sector, and I look forward to further discussion today,” Lew , according to a transcript of his remarks. Industry sources responding to the news  it is still unclear how these regulations are being delayed. The policies in question require all Chinese financial institutions to ensure 75 percent of their information technology infrastructure uses \"secure and controllable\" or Chinesedeveloped products and services by 2019. One open question is if China is simply pushing back the deadline, or suspending the rules for further consideration. “We are still trying to understand the situation given the limited information available, but the Chinese leadership does seem to agree a delay is needed to reassess these measures,” Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai,  in a statement. “The Chinese government has appeared to have taken actions to reconsider the measures in light of serious concerns raised by global industry and government stakeholders. If the delay is officially confirmed, we welcome that news,” Jarrett added. These policies, which went into effect on March 15, apply only to the banking sector for now, but sources have  they expected the policies to be applied to other sectors. In order to be deemed secure and controllable, the products and services must undergo security testing that business associations have described as \"intrusive,\" and contain local intellectual property like encryption algorithms that were developed in China. The rules also prevent the flow of crossborder commercial data and require producers submit a product source code to the Chinese government. The announcement comes on the heels of China national legislature earlier this month saying it will not take up a draft counterterrorism law that would have also required companies to install socalled “back doors” into their products and services for the Chinese government to use. That law would have applied to all companies, including domestic ones. Lew highlighted the importance of the United States and China to work together to “establish and maintain clear rules in cyberspace” at a March 31 speech at the Asia Society Northern California in San Francisco. He reiterated his criticism of China cybersecurity regulations, but he did not address whether those regulations had been delayed. The secretary trip to China touched on other issues in the bilateral economic relationship between the United States and China, as well as preparations for the next Strategic and Economic Dialogue.',\n",
       " 'US to impose sanctions on overseas cyber attackers Gina Chon in Washington Financial Times April 1, 2015 5:54 pm Barack Obama has declared cyber threats from abroad a “national emergency,” as the US president took action to impose sanctions on overseas actors engaging in cyber attacks that threatenAmerica’s national security or economic health. The president’s executive order gives his government new powers to target significant cyber threats that affect critical infrastructure, disrupt the availability of web sites or networks, or steal trade secrets and financial information, such as large troves of credit card data. US officials declined to name potential targets of the new sanctions but , as an example, that the executive order could be used against individual hackers hired by companies or countries. The US has already ratcheted up its response to cyber breaches, imposing additional sanctions in January on agencies and officials in North Korea, which it blamed for the breach at Sony Pictures Entertainment last . In May 2014, it indicted five Chinese soldiers for hacking into six US companies. It is unclear whether the new authority will be used in cases that could raise political tensions, such as sanctions against Chinese officials. The new authority closes gaps that have posed a challenge to US law enforcement, such as cyber threats from countries that do not have extradition treaties with the US, lack strong cyber security laws or turn a blind eye to such attacks. The US hoped the executive order would encourage other countries to consider such sanctions,  Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and cyber security coordinator. Potential punishments include freezing assets under US jurisdiction, such as bank accounts, and prohibiting US persons or entities from engaging in transactions with those under sanctions. A spate of devastating cyber breaches at JPMorgan Chase, Target, health insurer Anthem and others has prompted the Obama administration to encourage more information sharing on cyber threats between government agencies and with the private sector. Legislation that would encourage such exchanges is again being considered in Congress. Similar bills have stalled in the past because of privacy concerns, but lawmakers are hoping that recent cyber attacks will move the proposals forward this . “Cyber threats pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges to the United States, and my administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to confront them,” Mr Obama  in a statement. “This executive order offers a targeted tool for countering the most significant cyber threats that we face.” Dmitri Alperovitch, cofounder of cyber security firm CrowdStrike, : “We are optimistic that the actions undertaken by the White House today will raise the cost to our cyber adversaries and establish a more effective deterrent framework to punish actors.” US officials were quick to emphasise that the new executive order would not be used to police the internet or stifle innovation. The new sanctions powers will apply only to significant cyber threats and would be used against individuals or organisations that knowingly receive or use trade secrets stolen through cyber breaches. Sanctions could also be imposed when the theft of trade secrets results in a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, or the economic health or financial stability of the US.',\n",
       " 'EU cannot maintain protection against Chinese imports, EU lawyers say * EU lawyers say EU cannot ignore rules on China new WTO status * EU yet to decide, could favour China to win favour with Beijing By Francesco Guarascio and Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, April 1 (Reuters) European fears of being forced to lower tariff defences against cheap Chinese imports have grown following a confidential warning from the EU own lawyers, who say the bloc should not ignore changes to global trade rules set to favour Beijing. In a draft letter seen by Reuters, the head of the European Commission Legal Service, Luis Romero Requena, warned the head of the trade directorate that the EU would not have a good case to disregard the effects of the World Trade Organization viewing China as a more marketbased economy a status that will make it harder for other powers to justify current high tariffs. In asking its lawyers to help it decide, the EU executive has shown how it is caught in a dilemma between shielding local industry and jobs and seizing a chance to win friends in Beijing and gain an edge over U.S. rivals as China opens up its markets. A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom declined comment on the letter but stressed that legal opinions would only form one part of a broader reflection currently under way on the implications of expiring WTO limitations on China right to claim equal treatment with its freemarket competitors. European manufacturers say the future of EU industry depends on preventing China from flooding markets with illegally cheap goods, but rules allowing the EU to protect itself with some ease expire next  and Europe is divided over how to act. The WTO recognised when Communistruled China joined the free trade body in 2001 that its local prices are not set by market forces. WTO members can normally apply punitive \"antidumping\" tariffs on others only if export prices are below those in the exporter home market. But with China, the EU and others have been able to ignore low domestic prices and set tariffs to make Chinese exports as expensive as in wealthier countries. However, those WTO limitations on China appear to expire on Dec. 11, 2016 though there is some room for interpretation. Trade experts expect the United States to take the view that U.S. law makes no requirement for the government to change its treatment of China. Washington has not made its position public. Europe must take a decision soon because the legislative changes it will entail must be approved by the European Parliament and translated into the bloc 23 official languages. In the internal draft document seen by Reuters, EU lawyers recommended recognising the expiration of the current rules, warning that \"arguments to the contrary are not wellfounded\". In its fivepage, linebyline scrutiny of China WTO accession agreement, the EU Legal Service lawyers conclude it is \"a highrisk approach\" to try to argue that Beijing should still be treated differently from other major trading partners. Trade Commissioner Malmstrom spokesman told Reuters: \"The Commission is currently looking at the legal implications of the expiration of certain provisions of the protocol of accession of China to the WTO relating to the treatment applied to China in trade defence investigations. This will take some time.\" China is certain to launch a case at the WTO if the European Union chooses to maintain the status quo and can exert pressure in other ways by restricting EU access to its markets or by retaliating. Just last month, the EU slapped antidumping duties of up to 25.2 percent on some Chinese steel, using prices in the U.S. domestic market as a reference. The process is complex, but if the WTO modifies its view of how free China market is, tariffs might have to take more account of Chinese domestic prices. \"PLAYING FOR TIME\" Not everybody in Europe agrees with the EU lawyers\\' view, as China accession treaty to the WTO is written in a way that allows for different interpretations. A group of more than 20 European industries, from footwear to solar panels, wrote to Malmstrom on March 4 warning that changes to the rules on China would see the \"survival of many European companies...seriously threatened, with severe adverse consequences for European jobs\". They argue that China can get better treatment only if it is recognised as a market economy meaning decisions are made based on supply and demand, not the state but that remains a long way off, EU and U.S. officials have repeatedly . \"Some in Commission are trying to play for time, some in the Commission are trying to be too clever and think that the longer they postpone a decision, the more they can squeeze China,\"  Fredrik Erixon, the director of the Brusselsbased European Centre for International Political Economy. There is a lot at stake and not just for Beijing. The European Union has more than doubled trade with China since 2003, making it its second largest trading partner after the United States. Europe is China most  trading partner. Last month, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and other states joined a nascent, Chineseled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in defiance of Washington misgivings, as China seeks a greater role in shaping global economic governance. Beijing and Brussels are also negotiating an investment treaty to give the EU greater access in China, from banking to telecoms, and to push Beijing to drop onerous requirements that Europeans must hand over sensitive knowhow to expand there. China eventually wants a freetrade deal. But in the short term, there is friction as China seeks to produce the kind of sophisticated products that compete directly with Europe and the changes would be huge for European industry.

India has not been invited to join pacts such as the U.S.led 12 country TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and is \"not in a position to join,\" partly because its tariffs are not competitive, a top official  at the unveiling of a new five  trade policy. \"If the country is to stand up to these agreements, it  that we start to address these issues,\" Trade Secretary Rajeev Kher , adding that India access to markets was likely to erode when such pacts take effect. Kher  India needed lower tariffs for intermediate goods to help it further integrate with global supply chains, and that these industries would have to come more competitive. He did not give more details. Regional trade pacts are being promoted by advanced economies after  of failure to negotiate a global agreement under the World Trade Organisation. TPP would link a dozen AsiaPacific economies by eliminating trade barriers and harmonising regulations in a pact covering twofifths of the world economy and a third of all global trade. China, which is not part of the TTP negotiations, is pushing for a separate trade liberalization framework. \"They have been explicit about the fact that there are these mega agreements that we are not invited to as a response to that they are trying to fix things internally,\"  Akshay Mathur, head of research at foreign policy think tank Gateway House. Kher  India was interested in a third grouping known as RCEP that combines Southeast Asian nations and six others Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. \"India expects to be a major beneficiary of the ASEAN Plus six trade pact for which negotiations are likely to be completed by  end,\" Kher . Experts say the viability of that grouping may depend on India progress in easing domestic regulations and external barriers that constrain economic activity.

       " 'India moves closer to WTO norms Asit Ranjan Mishra Mint New Delhi, April 1 The government on Wednesday revamped the export subsidy regime and indicated its intention to phase out subsidies for overseas shipments in compliance with rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) while setting an ambitious export target of $900 billion to be met by 201920. Unveiling the longdelayed fively foreign trade policy (201520), commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman  the policy will no longer be revisited annually and will only be reviewed after twoandahalf  to provide a stable policy framework. The new policy merged all subsidy schemes for merchandise exports and service exports into two separate schemes to simplify the export subsidy regime, and for the first time included units within exportoriented special economic zones (SEZs) under the ambit of such incentives. In the process, the government hacked through a plethora of schemes that had been targeted at specific products and specific markets, complicating the subsidy regime. Ecommerce also received a boost, with the government adding to the export subsidy regime exports of up to Rs.25,000 through courier services for items such as handlooms, books, leather footwear, toys and customized fashion garments from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai airports. On 22 October, Mint had reported about planned incentives for ecommerce, and on 30 March on the consolidation of merchandise export subsidy schemes under the new trade policy. The $900 billion target for exports is more than twice the $466 billion India earned from overseas shipments in 201314. If the target is met, India would grab a share of 3.5% of world exports, up from 2% in 201314. The new policy lays down a fresh approach to the export of goods and services from India,  Himanshu Tewari, partner, indirect tax, BMR and Associates Llp. \"The changes are beneficial to the exporting community, with special focus on services exporters. Simplification of procedures will go a long way in integrating India in the global value chain, improving India ranking in ease of doing business index and reducing the transaction cost in international trade,\" he added. In simplifying the subsidy regime, the trade policy  the current WTO rules as well as those under negotiation envisage the eventual phasing out of export subsidies. \"This is a pointer to the direction that export promotion efforts will have to take in future, i.e, towards more fundamental systemic measures rather than incentives and subsidies alone,\" the new policy . A longterm branding strategy has been put in place to enable India to hold its own in a highly competitive global market and to ensure that \"Brand India\" becomes synonymous with high quality, the policy document . The new service incentive scheme will be applicable to both domestic and foreignowned service providers who are providing services from India. \"Earlier, only domestically owned hotels such as Taj Group used to get such incentives while foreignowned hotel chains such as Marriott were not eligible for such benefits. Now all of them will be eligible for such incentives,\"  Pravir Kumar, director general of foreign trade in the commerce ministry. The duty credit scrips available to both service and merchandise exporters as part of such schemes will now be freely transferable and can be used for payment of customs duty, excise duty and service tax. Sitharaman  the new policy provides a framework for increasing exports of goods and services as well as generation of employment and increasing value addition in the country, in keeping with the Make in India initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attract foreign manufacturers to the country. \"The focus of the government is to support both the manufacturing and services sectors, with a special emphasis on improving the ease of doing business,\" she added. To boost domestic manufacturing under the Make in India scheme, the commerce ministry reduced the export obligation for domestic procurement under the export promotion capital goods programme. In case capital goods are procured from indigenous manufacturers, export obligation has been reduced from 90% of the normal exports to 75%, to promote the domestic capital goods manufacturing industry. \"It is proposed to give higher level of rewards to products with high domestic content and value addition, as compared to products with high import content and less value addition,\" the trade policy . Kumar  out of 11,500 export product lines that India has, except for 5,500 product lines whose contribution to exports is $1 billion, most other items have been incentivized other than petroleum products and gold. Commerce secretary Rajeev Kher  that two institutional mechanisms are being put in place for regular communication with stakeholdersthe board of trade, which is an advisory body and needs to be reconstituted, and a Council for Trade Development and Promotion, which will have representation from state and union territory governments. The new policy  India future bilateral and regional trade engagements will be with regions and countries that are not only promising markets but also major suppliers of critical inputs and have complementarities with the India economy. \"The focus of India future trade relationship with its traditional markets in the developed world would be on exporting products with a higher value addition, supplying high quality inputs for the manufacturing sector in these markets and optimizing applied customs duties on inputs for India manufacturing sector,\" it . The new policy provides greater predictability because it would not be changed frequently while the focus on building \\'Brand India\\', through different sets of incentives for merchandise and services exports, would help India exports become competitive in the world market, Engineering Export Promotion Council chairman Anupam Shah . He added that the downside is that export benefits for engineering tariff lines have been reduced and no transition period has been allowed. \"At least six months of transition period should have given so that the exporters could adjust to the new framework. Further, the interest subvention scheme has also not materialized. This will impact adversely on the exports of engineering goods to some extent,\" he added.',\n",

In its baseline scenario, the bank expected Russia gross domestic product to contract by 3.8 percent in 2015 and a further 0.3 percent in 2016, describing mediumterm growth prospects as dim. The World Bank lead economist for Russia, Birgit Hansl,  \"adjustment to the new oil price reality and the sanctions environment\" was a key policy challenge. \"If we look more into the medium term, the main challenge for Russia is the continued dearth in investment,\" she , presenting the report. The bank latest forecasts are more pessimistic than those made in December, when it expected the economy to shrink by 0.7 percent this  and grow by 0.3 percent in 2016. The new baseline forecasts assume that the oil price will recover only marginally over the next two , averaging $53 per barrel in 2015 and $57 per barrel in 2016, reflecting ample global supplies and moderate demand. Under a more optimistic scenario, with oil averaging $65.5 per barrel in 2015 and $68.7 per barrel in 2016, the economy would contract by 2.9 percent this  and grow by only 0.1 percent in 2016, the World Bank . Its latest forecasts assume that sanctions imposed against Russia because of its role in the Ukraine conflict would stay in place in 2015 and 2016. The sanctions could have damaging longterm consequences that may last even after the sanctions are lifted, the bank , citing the case of South Africa where sanctions imposed in the 1980s caused a major slump in investment. In Russia case, sanctions were likely to exacerbate an existing investment shortage. \"Low investment demand hints at the deeper structural problems of the Russian economy and has already initiated a new era of potentially small growth,\" the report . The bank also warned that a projected 3.8 percent budget deficit this  could \"severely deplete\" the budget Reserve Fund, currently equal to around 4.7 percent of GDP. Hansl , however: \"One could argue that it is prudent to use fiscal buffers at these times as a countercyclical measure.\" END',\n",
       " 'China Focus: Heavy metal losses for China rare earth companies shihao 3 April 2015 Xinhua China Economic Information Service BEIJING, April 3 ( Xinhua) Two of China major rare earth miners reported sharp falls in profits in 2014, in the face of poor demand and weak prices. Major producer, REHT reported on Friday 5.84 billion yuan (949 million U.S. dollars) in operating revenue in 2014, down 31.1 percent from 2013. Net profits plummeted by 57.4 percent to 643 million yuan, according to the company annual report. On the same day, China Minmetals Rare Earth Co. posted a 64.8 percent drop in operating revenue to 702 million yuan and its balance sheet turned from black to red with 55.8 million yuan in net losses. China Minmetals deliberately reduced sales last , leading to great losses. Both enterprises blamed weak demand and low prices. Rare earth prices are at a multi low, despite a slight rebound at the end of 2014. Upgrading the industry, big enterprises were merged with dozens of small miners around the end of last  to establish six major rare earth groups: REHT, China Minmetals, Xiamen Tungsten Co.,  Aluminum Corporation of China, Guangdong Rare Earth Co. and China Southern Rare Earth Group. The rare earth branch of Xiamen Tungsten made a loss in 2014 and the remaining three firms have yet to release their annual reports. Rare earths, a class of 17 minerals, are some of the most sought after metals due to their military use and role in green technology like wind turbines and car batteries. China meets over 90 percent of the world demand, but at the cost of much pollution. To curb environmental degradation and protect resources, China began to set quotas and high duties on rare earth exports in 2010, causing friction with the  European Union, Japan and the United States. A  WTO ruling last August declared the measures inconsistent with  WTO rules and China Accession Protocol. China removed quotas on Jan. 1 this  and will cancel export duties on May 3. China rare earth industry has always been beset by problems including illegal mining, smuggling and a lack of competitiveness due to weak research and development. \"When all barriers are lifted, regulators will face fresh pressure and will need effective instruments if the industry is to prosper,\"  Wu Yiding of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology.

       " 'ECOWASTNCB Meeting On Trade Facilitation Agreement Kicks Off Momodou Faal by Momodou Faal 3 April 2015 All Africa Apr 03, 2015 (The Daily Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) The  Economic Community of West African States Trade Negotiation Capacity Building ( ECOWASTNCB) project, in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade, Industry, Regional Integration and Employment, yesterday began a twoday workshop on the  World Trade Organisation ( WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement, at the Kairaba Beach Hotel. Funded by the ECOWAS Commission and the  Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the meeting will focus on overview of TNCB Project, understanding the Trade Facilitation Agreement and its implication, categorising Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) provisions into A, B, and C; the role of the National Trade Facilitation Committee, Special & Differential Treatment (S&DT) notification requirement, among others. Speaking at the occasion, Fatim Njie, the deputy permanent secretary at the Ministry of Trade, Regional Integration and Employment, deputising for her ministry permanent secretary, affirmed that the workshop is on the recently agreed  WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement to assist The Gambia categorise its commitment into A, B, and C for notification recommendations under the agreement. She explained that the Trade Facilitation Agreement contains provisions for expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods, including goods in transit and it also sets out measures for effective cooperation between customs and other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and custom compliance issues. DPS Njie pointed out that the Ministry of Trade has a central role in ensuring that trade is facilitated at all times and this is evident in the ministry policies, measures, strategies and approach in consultation of stakeholders at any time on any trade policy decision. In line with this, she went on, the ministry created the National Trade Policy Decision Making Committee with a view to mainstreaming trade and traderelated issues into national development strategies that could work in this direction. The Trade DPS further stated that the meeting will continue to discuss the ways and means on  ECOWAS support for the improvement of the work of the InterInstitutional Committee (IIC) and that it will help improve the technicians in formulating and implementing trade policies and programme measures in a way that is consistent with national and regional development aspirations. \"The workshop will avail us the opportunity to review the report of the needs assessment conducted under the agreement, and as well as enhance the participants\\' understanding of national obligations for the implementation of the TFA,\" she hinted. Madam Njie added that this workshop for notification recommendations should pay attention to category C which will require them to identify the kind of technical assistance and capacity building needed to enable them implement the specific articles in the agreement. According to her, the agreement has some flexibility favourable to the Least Developed Countries (LDC) like The Gambia. \"The deliberations of the meeting should be in the spirit of national interest and participants should discuss openly and frankly with a view to notifying The Gambia commitment under the  WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement\", she stressed. The DPS therefore thanked ECOWAS Commission through Swedish Government for providing both the technical and financial support that enables them to conduct the meeting in The Gambia. Kolawole Sofola, the TNCB Project coordinator, informed that a day meeting of the InterInstitutional Committee (IIC), which will review the functioning of the IIC and assess its future needs, would follow the twoday workshop. According to him, this will provide them an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the InterInstitutional Committee of The Gambia and share lessons from other committees. Sofola indicated that in order to effectively achieve its targets in an increasingly interconnected and integrated world, The Gambia will have to maximise the advantages from global trading system through active participation and subsequent implementation in the multilateral and regional negotiations and agreements such as the Doha Development Agenda and the Economic Partnership Agreement ( EPA), and the  ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET), which have received impetus with the historical reach at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali in December 2013. The TNCB Project coordinator explained that the project, which is funded by  ECOWAS and the Swedish International Development Cooperation, was set up to build the negotiation capacity of member states to enable them to benefit from their participation in the international trading system. He intimated that in its 1st phase, the project concentrated setting up the project secretariat at the ECOWAS Commission and building on human capacity and agreements, whilst the second phase, which built on the achievements of the first phase, was geared towards assisting member states to strengthen or establish national interinstitutional committees required for more effective participation in international trade. Mohammed Saeed, Senior Trade Facilitation adviser, Trade Facilitation and Policy for Business at  the International Trade Centre made similar sentiments, while Madam Baturu Camara of the Ministry of Trade, chaired the occasion.

       " 'When will Kazakhstan finally be allowed into the WTO? 3 April 2015 Kazakhstan Newsline KAZAEN By John C.K. Daly On January 1, the  World Trade Organization, responsible for 97 percent of world trade, celebrated its 20th anniversary. On its website the  WTO defines its role as \"the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations.\" The  WTO polices free trade agreements, settles trade disputes between governments and organizes trade negotiations and, most significantly,  WTO decisions are absolute and every member must abide by its rulings. Of the 15 independent nations that emerged from the breakup of the USSR in 1991, only Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan remain outside the  WTO, a situation that Kazakhstan, the ninth largest country in the world, the secondbiggest former Soviet republic and the largest economy in Central Asia, hopes to rectify later this . There are many yardsticks to evaluate Kazakhstan changes. When the USSR collapsed in December 1991, Kazakhstan inherited the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world after Russia, the United States and Ukraine as well as a centrally planned economy emphasizing armaments production, directed from Moscow. Kazakhstan government renounced nuclear weapons and by April 1995 had transferred all of its nuclear warheads to Russia, winning international plaudits. The nation efforts to move away from its inherited centrally planned economy to a free market model globally integrated have been no less impressive, if much less heralded, which membership in the  WTO is intended to crown. It has certainly been a long process, as Kazakhstan application to join the  WTO was submitted on January 29, 1996, less than five  after achieving full independence from the Soviet Union. The  WTO on February 6, 1996 established a Working Party for Kazakhstan admission to the organization. But, 19  after Kazakhstan expressed its desire to join the  WTO, the country is still waiting to see its membership approved, while Kyrgyzstan (1998), Latvia (1999), Estonia (1999), Georgia (2000), Lithuania (2001), Moldova (2001), Armenia (2003), Ukraine (2008), Russia (2012) and Tajikistan (2013) have all joined the trade organization ahead of it. Kazakhstan, along with Belarus and Uzbekistan, remain \"Observer governments\" with pending applications, leaving only Turkmenistan as the sole postSoviet state uninterested in  WTO membership. In contrast to Kazakhstan prolonged  WTO application Kyrgyzstan, from  WTO application to membership, took only two  and four months. The Kazakh economy is rich in natural resources including oil, natural gas, and minerals. With its significant geopolitical location, Kazakhstan also serves as a strategic entry point to the rest of Central Asia and borders regional powers such as Russia and China. Such opportunities would be welcome as the recent dramatic fall in global oil prices has inflicted substantial economic hardship. Kazakh Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov has emphasized how   WTO membership is to Kazakhstan, remarking, \"This is a balancer of our global economic relations. Through the  WTO, we will get access to an extensive global trading system, to its standards, rules and regulations. These same rules and regulations will apply to Kazakhstan in its trade with other countries. So, for us the  WTO is a signifier of growth, which we are consistently working towards.\" The Working Party on Kazakhstan accession to the  WTO consists of 39  WTO memberstates with the 28  European Union (EU) member states involved as a single entity. Kazakhstan has already signed bilateral trade protocols with 30  WTO memberstates, including the U.S. and the EU and by the end of 2011 had completed bilateral negotiations with all of its Working Party members. Since the  WTO was created in 1995, the U.S. administration has used the Genevabased group to help resolve a growing number of disputes, rather than attempting to impose sanctions unilaterally, an option that in many cases is illegal under  WTO regulations. To become members, candidate countries must agree to cut tariffs and change their laws to guarantee the rights of importers and exporters under  WTO rules. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has long been sanguine about what  WTO membership would mean for Kazakhstan. Speaking on Feb. 27, 1999 about the  World Trade Organization he commented about the aspirations of postSoviet nations, \"We are all holding talks, and we all want to join. But anyone who joins accepts certain conditions. He opens his own borders up fully and paves the way for a flood of Western goods into that country. In other words, regardless of whether we want to develop our own industries inside our own countries, Western goods will fill our markets up very cheaply, and our enterprises will stop producing. In that case, agreeing to open up fully let anyone who wants to bring his goods into our country threatens to cause unemployment and the shutdown of our enterprises.\" While a number of  WTO members welcomed progress in Kazakhstan accession negotiations they still expressed serious concerns about the absence of inputs and progress in tariff adjustment, regulations and practices governing sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and WTOinconsistent traderelated investment measures (TRIMS), including those in stateowned enterprises. Another stumbling block for Kazakhstan  WTO admission is its commitment to the Customs Union (CU) that it formed in 2010 with Russia and Belarus, which on January 1, 2015 became the  Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). The CU led to a rise in some trade tariffs disputes with other nations, subsequently requiring new discussions about the conditions of its  WTO entry. In June 2010 EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton warned that the CU might harm international trade and pose \"an additional barrier fencing Astana, Minsk and Moscow off from the  WTO.\" It is difficult to see these objections as anything other than a stalling tactic, however, as the activities of other international regional trading entities, including the EU and the  North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA) do not preclude or inhibit  WTO activity. Despite this, seeing darker ulterior motives in the EEU beyond mere economics, a September 29, 2013 Washington Post editorial warned that the \"Moscowled customs union... would be an E.U. rival and a means of realizing Mr. Putin dream of recreating something like the Soviet Union.\" More recently, objections have arisen among Kazakhstan Working Party members even though, in a rare display of bilateral accord in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis, both the U.S. and Russia support Kazakhstan accession as soon as possible, along with the EU and China. On a visit last month to northeastern Kazakhstan Deputy Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev remarked, \"We have almost completed all the preparations and the negotiation processes for the accession into the  WTO. But we still have some unresolved issues with Mongolia and Ukraine.\" As a  WTO Working Party has to make a unanimous recommendation to the General Council for admission, Kazakhstan admission is being sidetracked yet again. These delays do not only impact Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is situated in the heart of the Eurasian continent so it could serve as a transit route from East to West and from South to North and has spent billions on developing its railways and roads with the aim of Eurasia transit hub, which will benefit all of its neighbors China, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, transforming the country from \"landlocked\" to \"landlinked.\" Looking at the future, Kazakhstan has launched its new Strategy 2050 to become one of the 30 most competitive nations in the world by 2050. On November 25, 2014 WTO DirectorGeneral  Roberto Azevdo  that negotiations with Kazakhstan \"are at an advanced stage of maturity and on the threshold of conclusion,\" adding that a formal decision should be announced in early 2015. Given Azevdo comments and the fact that it is now early 2015, Kazakhstan long effort to join the  WTO seems on the verge of being fulfilled, an event that will not only benefit Kazakhstan, but all nations along the reviving Silk Road, according to UPI.com.

       " 'Make 2015 a  of world trade action 3 April 2015 EurActiv.com EURACOM International trade creates wealth and opportunities around the world. But the richest countries must take care to foster, not weaken the poorest, writes Anabel Gonzalez. Anabel Gonzalez is  the World Bank Group Senior Director for Trade and Competitiveness and the former Trade Minister of Costa Rica. Just months into 2015, the world is poised to reset the stage of international trade. A new negotiating agenda is gaining momentum. Leaders are striking up  conversations about trade openness and making progress in megaregional trade deals. This is good news. But if 2015 is the  of action in trade, let make sure all are included. The past 20  has seen spectacular growth in world trade new countries have joined the global marketplace, creating opportunities in places that otherwise might still be mired in poverty. The  World Trade Organization ( WTO) has helped to drive growth and poverty reduction in ways that would have been hard to imagine at its founding 20  ago. Yet today, world trade is fragile. Before the 200708 crisis, trade was growing at almost twice the level of real global GDP growth. Today, trade growth lags behind global GDP growth, hovering at 3 percent or below. The causes for this are complex. They go beyond the slowdown in global growth and are related to more fundamental, longterm changes. Trade growth increased in the 80s and 90s as tariffs were lowered and production fragmented into global supply chains. It decreased in the 2000s as the pace of this process slowed. But 2015 could be a turning point. Disappointment at the slowing engine of trade may provide fertile ground for policy action. Indeed, there are signs of new energy already. For one, there is the  WTO Bali agreement, the most significant since the  WTO was established 20  ago and a strong endorsement of multilateralism. The cornerstone of this achievement the Trade Facilitation Agreement promises to reduce trade costs in countries around the world. It is also a call for international assistance to developing countries, a rallying cry to help the world poorest governments remove trade barriers, integrate into global value chains, and upgrade the value they bring to the global market. There have also been significant signals recently that the United States, the world biggest economy, stands behind global trade. One such is the discussion around the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which would speed the country ability to approve trade deals. Yet another sign is the growing energy around the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), a landmark preferential trade agreement. The TPP would define trade rules for an area covering 40 percent of global output and set a new standard. Countries negotiating other preferential trade agreements would likely attempt to match the quality and depth of integration codified in the TPP. This dynamic would give new momentum to discussions between the US and  European Union on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a trade agreement involving 16 countries in the AsiaPacific, including China. In this new context, the international community must ensure the preservation of an inclusive system that gives voice to poor countries and maximises their gains from trade. Three priorities would help make this happen: First, we need to bolster the strength of the  WTO, where lowincome countries are guaranteed a voice. The best guarantee of an inclusive trade system is progress in multilateral trade negotiations. This means taking concrete steps toward closing the Doha Round: the G20 Trade Ministers meeting next October will be an  milestone, as will the December Nairobi Ministerial Conference of the WTO. Second, preferential trade agreements should be as open as possible, maximising gains for outsiders and minimising discrimination against them. Some changes through the megaregionals will benefit all improving transparency, streamlining regulation and opening the services sector, for example. But to maximise the longterm gains, membership should ultimately be available to all countries willing to meet the standards. International organisations should collect and analyse information on the terms of these deals. We must help countries identify policies that have harmful sideeffects for countries not party to them, or policies that reduce the efficiency of the global trading system. Finally, we should continue to provide development assistance. To build a strong and inclusive multilateral trading system, we must help poor countries meet the standards set in megaregional deals. These agreements must provide an opportunity for faster, deeper international integration, while still preserving a sense of unity in the broader trade regime. None of this will fall into place automatically. Leadership from key players is essential to make it happen.  The World Bank Group is ready to play its part. >> Read: HYPERLINK \"javascript:void(0)\" Development research at the World Bank ',\n",
       " \"We are getting frustrated with China: Rajeev Kher Asit Ranjan Mishra 3 April 2015 New Delhi, April 3 The commerce ministry on Wednesday brought out its muchdelayed fively foreign trade policy (FTP) 201520. Commerce secretary  Rajeev Kher is the author of the radical policy that includes a separate statement analysing the challenges and opportunities for India exports. The policy also amalgamates the myriad export subsidy schemes into a services and a merchandise exports promotion scheme. Kher spoke in an interview about why subsidybased exports regime is not sustainable and the opportunity and challenges of megaregional trade agreements. Edited excerpts: What are the broad principles behind the FTP? About a  ago, when we started looking at this, we thought the focus is too much on incentives. Clearly, these incentives are very  because they, to some extent, neutralize the difficulties of infrastructure, processes, etc. But they become the beall and endall for the industry. Policy and incentives are considered synonymous with each other. Then, these incentives have to be rooted in something. You can't be providing 2% incentive to one and 3% to the other without a logic or context. Thirdly, there is so much happening globally, (and) we seem not to acknowledge that. So the whole idea was to create a stateoftheart document, which will give a sense of where we are and where we propose to go. And within that, we have rooted the incentives and processes. The principle that governs this is...we have picked up from the already flowing menu on the tableMake In India, Digital India, Skills India, ease of doing business and trade facilitation. So we are trying to see how we can integrate with all of this. Most ly, commerce is the frontend of economic activity. You cannot do anything unless the backend is also taken care of. So we need to acknowledge that trade policy can do only good when the backend is taken care of. That connect of backend and frontend has to be brought in very carefully which is what this policy clearly acknowledges. Are you preparing the ground for subsequent phasing out of export subsidies? You cannot run a foreign trade regime purely driven by subsidies. Clearly, for a long time, China has done that, many countries are doing it and we have also been doing that. But the reality has to be faced. First of all, we still don't have deep pockets; we cannot offer the kind of subsidies that some of our trading partners have given. Two, I have been speaking about the whole gamut of the subsidy agreement (under  WTO) and we need to recognize what is the reality of law and our commitment. Within this framework, we will have to adjust ourselves. In order to adjust, at some point we have to do away with the subsidies. I am not saying it will be at the end of these five . But, you must prepare yourselves for a gradual phase out. You have also spoken about high tariff protection some sectors are enjoying. Why not unilaterally reduce tariffs and negotiate with countries based on market potential? Tariffs serve the traditional purpose of creation of a protective wall and the modern purpose of getting you into the value chain. I would like to subscribe to the second purpose. If you identify a value chain, see the point at which you enter the value chain and then create a tariff framework which has lower tariff, thus making it easier for imports to come in so that you can derive value added advantage. That does not mean we need to drastically reduce tariffs. I am not at all making a case for that. But there is case for rationalization or optimization of tariffs keeping in mind that we want to enter certain value chain and we want to add to the Make In India focus. Therefore, to derive advantage, if we need to optimize tariffs, we should. Which are the sectors that are enjoying high tariff protection right now? I don't want to get into that because whatever I say will unnecessarily create controversy. But we know there are certain sectors where there is high tariff protection. Those sectors clearly benefited by it and they acknowledge that and they have come to a point where they are a global industry. You are referring to the automobiles sector. I am basically talking about automobiles and auto components. But at some point, you need to ask, is there a case for me to bring down the tariffs, because the higher protective wall is now making me less and less competitive? Look at agriculture. To make India a processing hub, is there a case for me to make my tariffs rational which will help me in being a competitive processor? I am not saying we just need to pick up these two. I am just giving examples. You have set an export target of $900 billion by 2020. Don't you think that is too ambitious? I don't think so. $900 billion by 2020 is a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 14%. Between 2004 and 2014, our exports have grown by 13.5%. I acknowledge that during that period, the economy has grown phenomenally, but then we are hoping for better days on two accounts. One, we hope the world economy will come out of this low; nobody has  that this (current downturn) will go on for more than two . Two, domestic consumption and competitiveness is bound to increase because of all this focus on infrastructure and manufacturing. And also (because of) what is happening in our neighbourhood. There are trading partners (such as China) who are growing at a subdued rate compared to their earlier growth rate. So all of this will give us the opportunities. Therefore, I think a 1314% growth rate is not unachievable. But this projection comes at a time when our merchandise exports have been contracting for three consecutive months. Mega trade agreements such as TPP (TransPacific Partnership) and TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) in which we are not part of, will pose significant challenge to our exports. So how do you see the $900 billion projection from that angle? Yes, it is challenging. Our exports have shown sustained negativity in last three months. But the second thing, I don't consider a negative because if we play our cards well even without being members of these mega agreements, we can get benefit out of them. We need to strategize our relationships appropriately. That is something that I cannot speak out openly about. We can do that. One of the biggest problems for India trade policy has been the inability to penetrate the Chinese market. Where do you think we are lacking? You can do only as much as possible within your reach. When it comes to market access in China, we have tried several permutations and combinations. There has been sustained campaign by us to find market access in China at least in three or four product areas such as meat, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, information technology. There has been a lot of conversation with China. There have been a lot of paperwork, memorandums of understanding (MoUs). But when it comes to our exports, it is not happening. So clearly, something is missing. On our part, we have focused on sending delegations continuously once in a few months. China has also invited us in many delegations and fairs. But the thing is you need to address the real pain. For example, in IT sector, the disadvantage that I have, aside from (lack of knowledge of) the Chinese language, is that I don't know the procurement profile of state enterprises. My industry needs to understand what is the market opportunity. If Chinese stateowned enterprises are not advertising, if they are following purchasing procedures that are not transparent... In pharmaceuticals, market authorization in China takes up to three to four . The fee is very hefty. I had a conversation with the Chinese ambassador a few days ago. I have requested him to convey that we are getting a little frustrated in this exercise. We want that when the Prime Minister ( Narendra Modi) will be visiting China later sometime (next month), we should be in a position to show some concrete results, not just one more MoU. So we are hoping for the best. Published by HT Syndication with permission from MINT.\",\n",
       " \"Editorial: Exports policy won't help The Financial Express 3 April 2015 Financial Express The government has done well to streamline the process of export incentives, so while they have been reduced, they are more in line with  WTO rulesthis means, over a period of time, the incentives have to be phased out. As a result, while the Merchandising Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) seeks to replace 5 existing schemes, the benefits under it will range from 25% as compared to 27% earlier. And in the case of the Services Exports from India Scheme, the benefits will range from 35% as compared to 510% earlier. In order to compensate for the reduction in benefits that were also difficult to encash earlier, the schemes have been made simpler. The export credits under MEIS and SEIS, for instance, are freely transferable and can be used for payments of all taxes ranging from customs duties to service taxes. In the case of EPCG, the export obligations have been reduced. And since the finance ministry has refused, so far, to budge on eliminating MAT and DDT on SEZs, units in these zones have been given the benefits of MEIS and SEIS. While the government has not given any target for manufacturing exportstargets over the past few  have been missed by a huge marginit has set an overall one for both manufacturing and exports. At $900 billion by FY20, this is roughly doubling of exports in the next 5 . While services exports rose from $142 billion in FY12 to just $151 billion in FY14, manufacturing exports rose from $306 billion to $314 billion. Global growth collapsing, and especially in trade, has been the biggest reason for this poor performance. There are, though, equally  other reasons as well. Of the major export groups, only agriculture has seen its exports share risefrom 7.1% of all exports in FY10 to 10.3% in FY14, before falling to 9.6% in AprJan FY15but onoff export policies have prevented this sector from achieving full potential. Ore exports have collapsed, from a share of 4.9% in total exports in FY10 to a mere 0.7% in AprJan FY15, a response to both mining bans in the country as well as the collapse in Chinese demand. The share of textiles in India exports basket has risen a bit, but by and large, the market that China has vacated due to its appreciating currency has been captured by other countries. The lesson, an obvious one, is that exports cannot be driven by sops, they need a lot more. To begin with, until India infrastructure and labour productivity deficit is not addressed, there is a natural ceiling to growth. Two, the rupee is just too strong and the problem here is that the government seems to prefer a stronger rupee rather than a weaker one. SEZs and NIMZs have been seen as a way out of the infrastructure/ labour problem, but the government seems unwilling to go the whole distance on this as evidenced from the MAT/DDT imbroglio. While the Budget did well to try and address the issue of inverted duties, the fact that India let the  Nokia plant shut down indicates how the export effort needs to be very coordinated between all arms of the government. And finally, since exports are driven by companies, it is  that India be a part of global valuechainsthat means trade policy has to focus on being a part of big regional trade pacts like the TPP; being a high import dutyzone is no longer an option.

       " 'India; Prime minister & BJP chief bat for farmers\\' welfare ARCHIS MOHAN Bengaluru 4 April 2015 Business Standard Party wary of 2015 becoming its  of defeats due to antipoor image The top two in the government and in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Prime Minister  Narendra Modi and party President Amit Shah, respectively, spent the day trying to hard sell not just the contentious land Bill but also how the Modi government stood for the welfare of farmers. Shah inaugural address on the first day of the BJP national executive laid bare the party unease at the Opposition criticism that it runs a government at the Centre that is antipoor and procorporate. Modi, at a rally at the city National College Grounds, also tried to counter the Opposition allegations by talking at length the government proposed programmes for the welfare of farmers and to make agriculture more productive and reduce agrarian distress. The prime minister elaborated his government efforts in trying to improve farm yields through better irrigation, soil testing facilities and improved seeds. He  India villages have been kept away from development pucca roads, power supply, water for irrigating fields and homes. \"Shouldn\\'t villages get these facilities?\" he asked. \"Those spreading lies do not know how to protect the interests of farmers,\" Modi . \"How did farmers lose their land? Where did it go?... To get a job of a peon for their children or to make them a driver, they used to be compelled to sell their land to pay bribes.. The (previous) governments compelled them to (sell land),\" Modi  on a day when the government repromulgated the land acquisition ordinance a day before it is to lapse. Modi  he knew of several farmers with landholdings of two to five bighas who would rather sell a portion of their land to raise money to bribe government officials and get their sons jobs as peons and drivers. \"It is our governments of the past that have forced farmers to sell their lands,\" the PM . In his speech Shah  the Modiled government was \"of the poor, farmers and workers\". He  BJP workers could claim with \"utmost conviction\" that the Modi government had not brought a single amendment to the land Bill that was antifarmer. He described 2014 as a  of electoral triumphs for the BJP, with the party winning the Lok Sabha and the state Assembly elections that . But he seemed wary that 2015, which started with the embarrassing loss in Delhi, could end with a reverse in Bihar. He asked the party to work hard to ensure a majority in Bihar. Shah spoke at the meeting standing in front of a backdrop that read \\'antyodaya hamara sankalp\\' or \\'our pledge is to reach the last man, the poorest of the poor\\'. The BJP president spoke for an hour but rarely about the  Narendra Modi government notching up key successes in pushing its reformist agenda during the Budget session of Parliament.

       " \"Seychelles will become 161st member of WTO on 26 April 3 April 2015 Bulletin Quotidien Europe Agence Europe All Rights Reserved Brussels, 02/04/2015 (Agence Europe) On 24 March, the National Assembly of the Republic of Seychelles unanimously ratified the accession protocol to the  WTO of this India Ocean archipelago, meaning that it can officially join the multilateral organisation on 26 April. The General Council of the WTO gave its approval to this accession on 10 December last , putting an end to a process that was started in 1995 and that was strongly supported by the EU. During their accession negotiations, the Seychelles concluded 17 bilateral agreements with the  WTO: eight on access to the goods markets, and nine on access to the services markets. The conclusion of an agreement with the EU in October 2013 speeded up the accession process. Fishing and tourism are the pillars of the economy of this 90,000inhabitant archipelago. The EU is the Seychelles' main trading partner, accounting for 66% of its exports and 33% of its imports. In 2013, the total value of EU goods exported to the Seychelles was 316 million, while imports from the archipelago to the EU amounted to 294 million. Over 90% of the Seychelles' exports to the EU are fish and fishery products. The EU main exports to the Seychelles are frozen fish, machinery, electrical equipment, ships and boats. Bilateral trade in goods is governed by the interim economic partnership agreement, which has been provisionally applied since May 2012. (Emmanuel Hagry) Agence Europe SA\",\n",
       " 'Yuan on a Silk Road to global acceptance 4 April 2015 The Nation Signs that the pace of yuan internationalisation is gathering momentum are coming thick and fast, with the launch of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Silk Road Fund and various speeches on the currency by the People Bank, in the last month or so. What are the real benefits and risks of yuan internationalisation? Basically, there are five major reasons why the Chinese currency should be more internationalised. Five reasons for yuan internationalisation First, China achieved a GDP of $10 trillion last , becoming the secondlargest economy in the world behind the US. As one of the largest trading nations, China today accounts for roughly 13 per cent of world GDP and slightly more than 10 per cent of global trade. Yet the value of yuan turnover in global FX markets still remains less than that of the Australian or Canadian dollar and way behind the US dollar (roughly 60 per cent of FX turnover), the euro (20 per cent), pound sterling and the yen. It seems natural that the currency of a major economy should have a correspondingly large share in global trading and exchange. The second reason is that China is a major importer of commodities and exporter of consumer goods, and payment in the currency of your major supplier is good for currency risk management for both buyers and sellers. With the growing sophistication of Chinese financial institutions in supporting trade and the creation of a global yuan clearing and settlement system by this , transactions costs for trades in yuan could be as cheap and robustly settled as they are in dollars or euros. Third, since China is already the largest importer of commodities such as iron and coal and also crude oil, more and more commodities are likely to be priced in yuan rather than dollars. The Chinese would like to pay in their own currency and if the sellers feel comfortable investing in yuan because of liquidity and longterm returns, there is no reason why some of the key commodities will not be priced in yuan. Fourth, yuan internationalisation is good for China as a reform driver. Major reforms in China have historically come from \"reverse pressure\", not just from internal needs, but because China has become more engaged in global affairs and thus subject to global standards and rules. The move to join the World Trade Organisation in 2001, which required huge internal adjustments and concessions to comply with WTO rules, was initially considered by many in China as \"selling out\". But China was achieved major benefits by joining the WTO in terms of both trade and investments. Hence, yuan internationalisation , which will require capital account liberalisation, internal reforms in interest rate and exchange rate liberalisation and more liquidity and competitiveness in domestic banking, insurance and capital markets , is seen as not only good for China, but also for global financial markets. Fifth (and this is not so obvious to many observers), there is an imperative for the yuan to join the international reserve currency group, such as the IMF Special Drawing Rights\\' component currencies. Some critics think that China wants this for the prestige, but in reality, if China does not join soon, the IMF and the World Bank will not have enough liquidity to deal with the coming global financial crisis. Global financial assets (not counting derivatives) have risen to roughly $275 trillion , roughly three and a half times world GDP, mainly because global leverage is growing faster than GDP. At the same time, the central banks\\' balance sheets have ballooned to nearly 8 per cent of total financial assets, mainly because of quantitative easing by the major central banks, primarily the US Fed, European ECB and Bank of Japan. Because central banks lend against collateral, a lot of the socalled riskfree bonds are tied up in central banks. Liquidity in such sovereign debt has become more volatile, as the large global banks are required to maintain higher capital for them even to marketmake in these assets. With the emerging market debt beginning to rise in the face of higher real interest rates, more volatile capital flows and geopolitical risks, it would not be surprising if the next decade delivers another round of financialmarket spikes, if not an outright crash. Currently, the Bretton Woods twins, the World Bank and IMF, have total balance sheets of $800 billion (slightly more than 3 per cent of global financial assets). Since the US and European members who control these multilateral institutions are unwilling to increase their capital because of fiscal constraints, these safety nets will not have enough money to deal with impending financial crises that require more and more funding to resolve. Washington anger China Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road strategies, plus the AIIB, BRICS Bank and the Silk Road Fund are all attempts to fulfil the global need for infrastructure spending, improving trade and global liquidity in the event of another shock to the system. Thus, for the US to openly lobby against their creation and membership, as it has been doing, is a little bit like cutting off one nose to spite one face. Getting the yuan totally internationalised is likely to be a long and tortuous road. After all, it took the dollar 70  to overtake the pound, emerging as the dominant currency backed by an overwhelming dominant military force after the Second World War. One cannot but reflect that the yen challenged the dollar in the 1990s, only for the euro to overtake it as the No 2 reserve currency in the last decade. Both economies got into crises because their internal structures were not ready to take the stresses and strains of internationalisation. In other words, the road to yuan internationalisation will not be smooth as silk, but it could come sooner and in different ways than people think.

       " 'Trade dispute may eliminate \\'country of origin\\' labels from beef By HYPERLINK \"mailto:\" Rick Barrett of the Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel April 4, 2015 10:28 a.m. Package labels on fresh cuts of meat that identify where animals were born, raised and slaughtered could disappear soon in a trade dispute with Canada that also pits the meat industry against some farm groups, including Wisconsin Farmers Union. Next month, the World Trade Organization is expected to issue a final ruling in the dispute, which could have broad implications for Wisconsin agriculture industry. In a nutshell, Canada and Mexico have alleged that \"country of origin\" labelling on meat packaging in the United States puts them at a competitive disadvantage in the American marketplace. The WTO has agreed more than once with Canada and Mexico that the labels on fresh meat sold in the U.S. give the U.S. livestock industry an unfair edge. In a recent ruling, the organization  the labelling requirement forced meatpackers to keep detailed records on imported livestock, a burdensome process, thus giving them an incentive to favour U.S. sources. The regulation doesn\\'t contribute to food safety, according to the meatpacking industry. The best solution would be to drop the requirement,  Chris Young, an outreach specialist with the HYPERLINK \"http://www.aamp.com/\" American Association of Meat Processors, based in Elizabethtown, Pa. Country of origin labelling has contributed to HYPERLINK \"http://www.jsonline.com/business/withdemandoutstrippingsupplybeefpriceshitrecordb99471967z1298075441.html\" higher meat prices because packers aren\\'t importing as much beef and pork from Canada and Mexico, according to Young. \"It makes it very difficult to do business\" with livestock producers outside the U.S., he . Proponents of the labelling requirement say consumers deserve to know the source of their meat and that it a food safety issue because of foodborne illnesses that might come from outside the U.S. A decade of consumer polling has showed that 90% of the general public wants country of origin labelling,  Kara O\\'Connor, government relations director at HYPERLINK \"http://www.wisconsinfarmersunion.com/\" Wisconsin Farmers Union in Chippewa Falls. In February, Canada confirmed its first case of mad cow disease since 2011. Formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, mad cow disease is a progressive, fatal neurological illness that may cause a related disease, CreutzfeldtJakob, in people through food made from the sick cows. Mad cow disease \"puts a fine point\" on the need for country of origin labels, O\\'Connor . \"Consumers have a legitimate reason to know whether the meat they\\'re buying is coming from Canada, Mexico, Chile or some other country,\" she . The U.S. Department of Agriculture probably will wait until the World Trade Organization ruling in May before deciding whether to keep the labelling requirement, modify it to satisfy the WTO, or drop the requirement altogether. Fears of retaliation A lot is at stake for Wisconsin agriculture because Canada, especially, has threatened to place tariffs on U.S. products should the requirement remain in place. Canada and Mexico are the United States\\' largest export markets. They\\'re also the largest foreign markets for Wisconsin products, including the state $43 billion dairy industry. \"The retaliatory tariffs that we have been told will happen would definitely impact a lot of our dairy products. That not good,\"  Karen Gefvert, HYPERLINK \"http://wfbf.com/\" Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation government relations director. \"This trade issue is very . Just tell us what the rules are and we will play the game,\" Gefvert . Meatpacking is a global business. Many consumers probably aren\\'t aware that beef comes from other countries unless they look closely at the label. It not a food safety issue, though, because imported meat has to comply with U.S. standards, according to the American Association of Meat Processors. That organization and seven other groups in the industry sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the required \"born, raised and slaughtered\" labels on fresh meat packages. \"The costs associated with this new inefficient process will drive some processors, dependent on imports, out of business and will destroy the market for meat from imported livestock,\" a 2013 lawsuit against USDA noted. Producers favour labels Meatpackers say the labelling requirement becomes especially burdensome if a beef animal is born in the Upper Midwest, then is sent to a farm in Canada for fattening, and comes back to the U.S. for slaughter. Packers say the requirement makes it impossible to put three steaks in the same package under a general label showing all countries of origin together. Other groups, including HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.awxyCvDihto43mMq32+\" RCalf USA, which represents U.S. cattle producers, say the labelling requirement should be kept for marketplace competition reasons. If consumers can\\'t tell what country a package of meat is derived from, they can\\'t make an informed buying decision,  Bill Bullard, chief executive officer of RCalf, based in Billings, Mont. That gives the meatpackers \"tremendous power\" in the marketplace, Bullard . Canadian and Mexican officials have  the labelling requirement, implemented by the USDA in 2009, has led to weaker livestock exports to the U.S. That why they\\'ve asked the World Trade Organization to challenge the regulation. The global recession, not the labelling requirement, sapped the demand for meat products, counters Roger Johnson, president of HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.awxyCrk0Gw0q+\" National Farmers Union in Washington, D.C. Johnson  Congress and the USDA should hold firm to the requirement. \"American lawmakers should not be listening to the overblown rhetoric and retaliatory threats made by foreign governments and the multinational meatpacking industry. I think the folks who say this law needs to be repealed are on the wrong side of history. American consumers want to know more, not less, about where their food comes from,\" he . Labels as selling points Not everyone in the meat processing industry is against the labelling requirement. Some Wisconsin processors have used package labels as a selling point for meat that locally produced, organic or from grassfed beef cattle. Kelly Nolechek, president of Wisconsin Association of Meat Processors, and owner of Nolechek Meats in Thorp,  he tries to source his products from nearby farms. \"I can\\'t get everything locally because there not enough available. But I try to buy (livestock) that born, raised and harvested in the United States,\" Nolechek . If the labelling requirement is struck down, meat processors could still include the country of origin information on their packaging if they wanted. But the bigger companies probably wouldn\\'t do it because of the additional steps and costs involved in handling thousands of animals. Innovative marketers will find a way to use the information to their advantage,  Mark Kastel, founder of HYPERLINK \"https://iconnect.wto.org/,DanaInfo=.awxyCgtxu2ly0unN37x+\" The Cornucopia Institute in Cornucopia, which advocates for familyscale farms and organic farming. \"More consumers would express their opinion on this through their purchases if they had the knowledge to do so,\" Kastel .',\n",
       " \"India Prime Minister 3nation visit Ashok B Sharma (The Echo of India) Brussels may not be willingly to oblige India at the moment by inviting Prime Minister Modi as it is perturbed over the delay in rendering justice to two Italian marines who allegedly shot down two India fishermen in the country waters. But France and Germany have taken a different view and are to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Brussels' denial, however, does not upset Modi calculus. IndiaEU Broadbased Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) are still under negotiations striving to settle contentious issues relating to intellectual property rights among others. According to several trade analysts, watering down of India intellectual property regime and data exclusivity at the behest of the European Union, is likely to spell a doom for the India pharma and agrochemical industry in particular. The terms being insisted by the European Union are inimical to the dairy sector in the country. EU wants free access to their subsidized skimmed milk powder and Feta cheese. At the World Trade Organisation (WTO), India and other developing countries have been consistently complaining about highly subsidized European agriculture and protectionist barriers like high tariff regime, nontariff barriers and politically motivated sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS). These European initiatives have placed the farmers, in particular in the Third World countries at a serious disadvantage, denying them of a level playing field in the multilateral trade. While keeping their subsidy regime and protectionist measures intact, the European Union wants easy access of their farm products and also industrial products like scrap cars in the India market. It also wants elimination of export tax on raw materials exported to Europe. The European Union has become more protectionist in trade following the global recession that followed the liquidation of Lehman Brothers in US in 2008. Again the blow of the sovereign debt crisis made Europe difficult to recover and come back to its prerecession growth rate. EU had been a major destination for India exports which has experienced considerable shrinkage following recession in Europe. In such a situation it is unlikely that EU would make any major concessions to accommodate India exports. Rather it would be willing to seek more markets for its goods. However investment in enterprises is a different ball game altogether. India needs more inflow of foreign direct investments (FDIs) to facilitate growth. But unfortunately both trade and investment are clubbed together in BTIA which has made difficult to reach a final conclusion. Yet there is scope for striking bilateral trade and investment agreements with several European countries which can be a better option. Though in aggregate terms the countries of the European Union are growing slowly at 1.2 per cent, Germany, UK and France have the potentiality to grow faster. Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit France and Germany in the second and the third week of April and is expected to ink several bilateral agreements and seek investments from these countries. In his first leg of his visit he is scheduled to meet President Francois Hollande. The purchase of Dassault Aviation $12 billion Rafale fighter planes, Multicrore Maitri surfacetoair missile system project SRSAM project are likely to figure in the talks alongwith proposals for strengthening defence cooperation. The two sides are expected to take up Jaitapur nuclear power project where the two countries are planning installation of six nuclear power plants in a phased manner. On 6 December 2010 agreement was signed for the construction of first set of two thirdgeneration European Pressurized Reactors and the supply of nuclear fuel for 25  in the presence of the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the then India prime minister Manmohan Singh. But in this  Defence Budget there is very small space to make big ticket purchase in the pipeline like $12 billion for medium multirole fighter jets, $1.2 billion for six Airbus A330 tankers, $1.1 billion for 22 Boeing Apache attack helicopters, $1 billion for 197 light utility helicopters, $833 million for 15 Boeing Chinook heavy lift helicopters, $600 million for light howitzer guns from BAE Systems, $200 million for 98 Black Shark torpedoes from WASS, $350 million for 1,418 Israelimade thermal imaging sights for T72 tanks, $250 million for 262 Barak missiles from Israel Aerospace Industries. As India is a partner country to Hannover Messe 2015, Modi visit to Germany is likely to centre around urging for more investment flows into the country. Apart from inaugurating the Hannover Messe alongwith Chancellor Angela Merkel, he will also have bilateral discussions with Chancellor Merkel and other senior leaders. After the joint `Walk Through' of selected India stalls in Hannover Messe, both the leaders are scheduled to attend the inaugural session of IndoGerman Business Summit. More than 300 India companies and 100 CEOs of India companies are participating in Hannover Messe. About 12 state governments, including Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan and UP will exhibits their profiles in the State Pavilion adjacent to India Pavilion. Modi visit will not only be limited to these two European countries, but it will be TransAtlantic covering Canada as well. In his scheduled visit in midApril, he is expected to discuss with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and interact with the India community. It was Prime Minister Harper who cleared the deal for sale of Canadian uranium to India in 2012 for use in nuclear power plants. Apart from trade and investment issues, talks are likely to be on combating climate change and cooperation in renewable energy. Thus Brussels' denial to host Modi is not likely to upset India strategy, if bilateral agreements are carefully inked with France, Germany and Canada. India officials are quite confident of the success of the Prime Minister coming visit to France, Germany and Canada. (IPA)\",\n",

       " 'Nigeria, others hold Africas $350b real sector finance market By Femi Adekoya on April 7, 2015 The Guardian Citing a survey by the African Development Bank of 300 banks operating in 45 African countries, the World Trade Organsiation (WTO) has described the market for trade finance in Nigeria and other developing countries in the continent to be hovering around $350 billion. Indeed, the WTO noted that the figure could be markedly higher if a significant share of the financing requested by traders had not been rejected, noting that based on such rejections, the estimate for the value of unmet demand for trade finance in Africa is about $120 billion, representing onethird of the gap in the existing market. Comparing the situation in Africa to that of Asia, the WTO stated that the Asian Development Bank, in a similar survey in Asia, found preliminary estimates showing an unmet demand of about $800 billion. Based on the outcome of the surveys, the WTO stated that a lack of capacity in the financial sector to support industries, and also a lack of access to the international financial system could be a significant trade barrier for developing countries. According to the WTO, up to 80 per cent of global trade is supported by some form of financing or credit insurance noting that the impact of financial limitations on a countrys trading potential can be very, very significant. The DirectorGeneral, WTO, Roberto Azevdo in a statement stated that in many countries there is a lack of capacity in the financial sector to support trade, therefore limiting the ability of these countries to use simple instruments such as letters of credit for trade. He : After the financial crisis, the supply of trade finance has largely returned to normal levels in the major markets but not everywhere and not for everyone. The structural difficulties of poor countries in accessing trade finance have not disappeared indeed the situation may well have declined due to the effects of the crisis. There are indications that markets are even more selective now. Under increased regulatory scrutiny many institutions have lowered their riskappetites and are focusing more on their established customers. Some are deliberately decreasing their number of clients in a socalled flight to quality. In this environment, the lower end of the market has been struggling to obtain affordable finance, with the smaller companies in the smaller, lessdeveloped countries affected the most. Members asked us to provide more evidence of this phenomenon last . I was particularly struck by the fact that the financing gaps are the highest in the poorest countries, notably in Africa and Asia. And I was struck by the size of those gaps. Azevdo explained that the main reasons for the rejection of requests for financing include, the lack of creditworthiness or poor credit history, the insufficient limits granted by endorsing banks to local African issuing banks, the small size of the balance sheets of African banks, and insufficient US dollar liquidity. According to him, some of these constraints are structural, and can only be addressed in the medium to long term adding that the retreat of global banks from Africa, and from other poor countries, is one such issue. Small and mediumsized enterprises are the most credit constrained as 50 per cent of their requests for trade finance are estimated to be rejected. This is compared to just 7% for multinational corporations. Moreover, twothirds of the companies surveyed reported that they did not seek alternatives for rejected transactions. Therefore these gaps may be exacerbated by a lack of awareness and familiarity among companies particularly smaller ones about the many options, which exist. A large majority of firms stated that they would benefit from greater financial education. He lamented that the findings are particularly striking as Africa and developing Asia are two areas of the world in which trade has grown fastest in the past decade, stating that the potential evolution of new production networks is faster than the ability of the local financial sectors to support them. This way, the lack of development of the financial sector can be a significant barrier to trade. It can prevent developing countries from integrating into the trading system and accessing further trade opportunities. And it can therefore prevent them from leveraging trade as a powerful source of development. So we need to respond to this problem. At the WTO we are doing everything we can to help developing countries to integrate into the global trading system. This is reflected in our technical assistance work. It is reflected in the outcomes of the Bali Package, which we are implementing now. And it is reflected in the current negotiations on the work programme to conclude the Doha Round. But the effectiveness of all this work will be lessened if proper access to trade finance is not secured, the WTO boss added.',\n",

       " \"Incentives cant go on forever; beyond a point, one has to be competitive Nayanima Basu 7 April 2015 Business Standard PRAVIR KUMAR, the Union governments director general of foreign trade, clarifies aspects of the Foreign Trade Policy 20152020, in an interview with Nayanima Basu. Edited excerpts: Was it a conscious effort by the government to make the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) in line with the countrys commitments at the World Trade Organization (WTO) or were you under pressure by the developed countries? Either way, this stance seemed to have not gone sown well with exporters. There is no question of pressure but of honouring your commitments. Once you are party to an agreement, it is expected of a responsible nation to come up with policies in tune with these. We cannot say one thing and sign on to something else. Its has to be cohesive. There is now a greater realisation that if we have to really boost exports, we need to improve internally. Thats why a lot of effort has gone into simplifying of processes. The external environment is out of our control. One aspect that has come out very clearly in the FTP is that the days when exporters can expect sops to become competitive are gone. Is this, again, due to commitments to global norms or to fiscal constraints? Both. Incentives cannot go on forever. We have to gradually take these away. We can justify and continue with those we can afford but beyond a point, we have to think of our own competitiveness. We can prop things up artificially but cannot make them run a marathon. The FTP has come after almost a . Since there was no mention on an interest subvention for exporters in the (Union) Budget, it was highly anticipated that the announcement would be done with the FTP release. Now, it seems, you will take a couple of more months to clearly come out with it. That is a budgetary announcement. So, the legislative decision is already there. We will come up with the scheme; right now, we are in the process of finalising a proposal. Once that is done, it will finally go to the CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs). It will take at least two months. The FTP statement categorically mentions that the thrust will be on sectors performing well, as well as labourintensive ones. Will those sectors get the three per cent interest subvention boost? That analysis is going on. The guidelines of the scheme have to be finalised. This is anyway not linked with the FTP. It will come after necessary approvals are taken. Applicable retrospectively or prospectively? It is generally done prospectively. But we have not yet taken a call on it. Will the Services Export from India Scheme (SEIS) be given to Special Economic Zone units? The policy says SEZ units are ineligible. SEZ units will get SEIS benefits. We will soon issue a corrigendum. The additional revenue outgo the government will have to bear for doing so? We have not calculated it. Ultimately, we were able to convince the finance ministry. There will be some outgo but then, we have taken into account all physical exports made from the country as a whole. Was it not an indirect way to pacify the SEZ units, in lieu of imposition of MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax), DDT (Dividend Distribution Tax)? Government has taken an overall view. It is part of the bigger picture. Also, it will not be given to information technology or ITenabled services' SEZs? ITITeS is, in any case, out of the purview of SEIS. The rule is the same, whether for DTA (Domestic Tariff Area) or SEZs. The duty scrips you are giving under MEIS and SEIS have basically become tradable. Earlier, exporters complained that by issuing duty scrips which were nontransferable, the government was incentivising imports. Now, we are also incentivising exports, as we have made it freely tradable. Now, our scrips are as good as cash. How will this check revenue loss? Earlier, middlemen were making money; now, they are eradicated. If an exporter who earns it has no excise duty to pay, no service tax to pay, he can simply encash it from any other exporter. There is no more restriction to it. By this, we have effectively checked the root cause of corruption, by eliminating the middlemen. Now that you have substantially reduced the export obligation under the EPCG (Export Promotion Capital Goods) scheme from 90 per cent to 75 per cent, do you feel there will now be less of defaulters? Under the EPCG scheme, the government is allowing import for local procurement of certain items needed for making export products, some capital goods that are required to manufacture certain exports. Now that we have to promote exports, we are looking at making import of those items easier, that help in producing such exports. So, this will help in both manufacturing and export.\",\n",

The Korean government proposed 43 items for tariff elimination including LED lighting, lithium ion accumulators, metal silicon, etc. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on April 5th, as a result of the EGA prenegotiation stage 1, 10 fields and over 580 items have been classified as potential candidates for tariff elimination. Based on this, EGA member states begin negotiations by item next month. EGA is a environmental product liberalization negotiation that 14 countries including Korea started since last  Davos Forum in January. The U.S.A.EUJapanAustraliaChina etc. have participated from the beginning. IsraelTurkeyIceland have joined later on, and thus, 17 countries are currently proceeding the negotiation. EGA member states have singled out 10 fields and around 580 items through five prenegotiations since last July. The 10 fields include ?Air Pollution Management ?FluidSolid Waste Management ?Environmental RestorationPurification ?CleanRenewable Energy ?Energy Efficiency ?Ecofriendly Products etc. The Korean government submitted 43 candidate items for tariff elimination that have industrial competitiveness and technical skills based on environmental benefits. LED lighting, carbon fiber, gas boiler, lithium ion accumulator, metal silicon, and more were included. Member states begin negotiation by item next month. After that, there are additional negotiations in June and July. Tariff eliminated items are selected by examining their environmental credibility and the approval of member countries. Without a particularly targeted amount, all items that arrive at an arrangement will be listed for tariff elimination. Once an item is listed for tariff elimination, the 17 member states eliminate its tariff immediately or in stages. Nonmember countries may also enjoy the nontariff benefit when exporting to EGA member countries. Member states have set settlement through the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference, which will be held in December, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties as their goal. Some say settlement within the  seems difficult, as opinions differ on opening certain items. The government has organized a public and private joint Task Force(TF) centering the Ministry of Commerce & Industry and the Ministry of Environment to effectively respond to EGA negotiations.

       " \"FOOTWEAR: Turkey imposes constraints to the imported footwear 6 April 2015 Investimentos e Notcias (Real Time) SO PAULO, 4/6/15 One more  character appears in the list of countries which impose barriers to Brazilian footwear. The Turkey, that since 2012 has been imposing restrictions on imports of footwear, is stepping up the barriers to domestic products since last , as instituted a 30% rate to 50% for the imported footwear that were not from the European Union, Israel, Macedonia, Bosnia, Morocco, the West Bank, Tunisia, Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Chile, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, South Korea and Mauritius. Despite the Turkey does not represent a significant volume of Brazilian footwear exports, the Brazilian Association of footwear Industries (Abicalados) sees with concern the protectionist movement, which considers illegal for being discriminatory. ' The World Trade Organization (WTO) grants the right of a nation to establish measures aimed at the protection of human health and also temporary safeguards, provided that they are not applied in a discriminatory manner ', explains the Chief Executive of Abicalados, Hector Klein. In addition to the tariff applied from 2014, the national footwear has lived since the end of 2012, with technical barriers of inspection of the chemical Phthalate. The inspections, which are carried out by Turkish laboratories before shipment, at the source, and also at the destination end up delaying and making business. ' Are subject to contestation barriers at the WTO ', says Klein. According to the Executive, the search through Abicalados with his associates, found that large exporters of footwear have reduced or eliminated their negotiations with Turkey due to barriers beyond the negotiations. Account Executive, still, that many companies have already dropped out of that market and others are ' thinking ' to remain competitive in that country. ' We have decreased their exporting shipments in more than 40% for there due to the restrictions. Others report that found themselves forced to reduce prices and increase the marketing investment to offset the effects of the barriers ' laments Klein, adding that all associated ears by the entity were emphatic in stating that have great interest in doing business with Turkey and believe in the potential of that market, provided that it is competitive or even impartiality visvis other countries which are not subject to the restrictions.

       " 'Data manipulation: India contests EU charges against GVK Bio Amiti Sen 6 April 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) Submits evidence to prove trials were clean; ready to take legal action if proof is rejected India has challenged the allegations of data manipulation levelled by European and French drug regulatory agencies against GVK Biosciences. New Delhi is ready to take commercial and legal action against the European Union (EU) if it does not react positively to evidence, a senior official told BusinessLine . It has supplied evidence to establish that the clinical trials were authentic. We have met the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the French agency and given them evidence to show the tests by GVK Biosciences were not manipulated, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher . Moving WTO an option If there is no response soon, India will be constrained to take commercial or legal action against the countries, Kher . Legal action could be in the form of action at the World Trade Organisation, he . Late last , French medicines agency (ANSM) alleged that its inspection of GVK Biosciences, Hyderabad, an India contract research organisation, revealed data manipulation of electrocardiograms (ECGs), over five , during research on generic medicines. In January, the EMA gave its harsh recommendation that a number of medicines for which authorisation in the European Union (EU) were primarily based on clinical studies conducted at GVK Biosciences in Hyderabad should be suspended. The European agencies have suspected the clinical trials on grounds that are absolutely flimsy. Not just GVK, but the companies for which the clinical trials were done, which include several multinationals, have given a plethora of evidence to show that there was no manipulation, Kher . The government has even got independent cardiologists to examine the ECGs, and they have given GVK a clean chit. We have asked EMA and some other European agencies to cross check the ECGs and get back to us, Kher . The Secretary  that there were just a few big multinationals that were driving an agenda against the generic (offpatent drug) industry, affecting Indias annual drug exports of $15 billion. It is  for us to take the matter to its logical conclusion, Kher . Indias strong retaliation against the EU action comes at a time when both the US and EU are taking an unprecedented number of measures against India pharmaceutical companies over quality issues. The past few  have seen a lot of action where the fault was not seen in the substance of the medicines but in the processes. We feel that this approach needs to be tempered, Kher .',\n",

We have discussed increasing the import duty with the Finance Minister, and we hope that we will get favourable results,\" Steel and Mines Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told a press conference here. The steel imports from China in AprilJanuary 201415 rose to 2.9 million tonnes (MT) against 1.08 MT for the entire 201314. During the same period, carbon steel imports from the neighbour stood at 1.52 MT while stainless/alloy steel imports came in at 1.37 MT.

       " 'Indonesia plays hardball with smartphone manufacturers By Charlotte Greenfield JAKARTA, April 3 (Reuters) When Polytron became the first Indonesian company to produce 4Gcapable smartphones last , it changed the \\'Manufactured in China\\' inscription on its handsets to \\'Made in Kudus,\\' a town in Central Java. Polytron relocated production from China to comply with \\'localcontent\\' rules introduced in 2012. The regulations have raised concerns about higher manufacturing costs and hung question marks over an industry championed by the Indonesian government. The United States has pressed Indonesia to relax the rules, which it says will hamper efforts of tech giants such as Apple Inc to expand into one of the world last big markets where use of smartphones has yet to truly take off. Assembling far from China electronics supply chain means it costs up to 50 percent more to manufacture a mobile phone in Indonesia, according to Polytron, a smaller player among local phone brands. \"Honestly, we are doing it because of the regulation, to be in compliance,\" Polytron spokesman Santo Kadarusman told Reuters. The government ramped up enforcement of the rules last . The regulations are part of a push under President Joko Widodo to transform Indonesia from an economy that consumes products into one that produces them, in his attempt to boost economic growth and eliminate the country trade deficit. Most mobile phones sold in Indonesia are made in China. There was no phone manufacturing industry in Indonesia until last  when 15 companies submitted plans to the Industry Ministry to start production. Among them was Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which opened a factory near Jakarta. The regulations require importers of smartphones to manufacture in Indonesia or have their import licenses revoked by 2016 or 2017, depending on when they received their license. The ministry is working on a new regulation targeting 4G smartphones. It is expected to be completed in June and come into force on Jan. 1, 2017. The rule will require all companies that sell 4Gcapable devices, including Apple and Samsung, to produce a certain percentage of \\'local content\\' in Indonesia. Apple did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the local content rule. Samsung declined to comment. It is unclear as to whether this regulation will replace existing requirements or how local content will be measured. Indonesia needs a bigger share of the $3 billion in annual phone imports to reduce its trade deficit,  Minister for Communications Rudiantara, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. \"This phone is $600$700, so we want $250$300 of that to go to Indonesia,\" he , pointing to his iPhone. LOCAL CONTENT Local content could include design through intellectual property fees in addition to manufacturing of handsets, Rudiantara . He declined to give further details on the way the percentage of local content would be calculated. Around a fifth of local content would have to be research and development, meaning companies would need to have a design development centre in addition to manufacturing,  Industry Minister Saleh Husin. Critics of the \\'Made in Indonesia\\' rule, including the American Chamber of Commerce, say the requirement is confusing and could increase costs, restrict access to technology and violate World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations. The U.S. Trade Representative is raising these concerns with the Indonesian government and the WTO. But Polytron is optimistic about the move, and expects its mobile division to make its first profit since it started in 2011 by the end of the . \"Our support from the government is the promise that other 4G brands cannot sell in Indonesia if local content is not 30 percent. Polytron is already at 35 percent. If Polytron gets to 40 percent local content, [the government told us] there is a possibility the local content requirement will go to 40 percent,\" Polytron spokesman Kadarusman . He declined to comment on how the local content percentage was calculated. Rudiantara  that after hearing of complaints, he was \"undecided\" on whether the required local content would be 40 percent, which he previously told companies. He planned to release a draft of the regulation in midApril to give companies time to raise concerns. He  higher costs would make it difficult for Indonesia to compete purely on manufacturing, but hoped his switch to include research and development would help. \"I\\'m not crazy. Ministers should have nationalism, but not chauvinistic nationalism,\" Rudiantara . \"If Indonesia competes only on producing hardware, it going to be difficult.\" (Editing by Ryan Woo)',\n",
       " 'Alexis Tsiprass soft fruit ploy with Moscow set to antagonise EU By Alex Barker in Brussels, Kerin Hope in Athens and Kathrin Hille in Moscow April 6, 2015 4:19 pm Financial Times When Alexis Tsipras visits Vladimir Putins Kremlin on Wednesday there is a chance the Greek premiers eastern manoeuvre will immediately bear fruit: kiwis, peaches and strawberries to be precise. Athens is hopeful that Moscow will lift a retaliatory ban on Greek soft fruits to demonstrate the abiding strength of RussoGreek relations, just as both leaders feel a diplomatic chill with Europe over the Ukraine crisis and Athens bailout saga respectively. But what worries European diplomats is that the PutinTsipras gladhanding amounts to something more significant than fruit trade. The big fear, in the words of one suspicious senior official, is a Trojan horse plot, where Russia extends billions in rescue loans in exchange for a Greek veto on sanctions a move that would kill western unity over Ukraine. No such shock is expected this week. But as Athens nears the brink of insolvency there is growing alarm that Mr Tsiprass radical left government might turn to Moscow in desperation. It would set off the biggest panic over Greeces strategic alignment since the 1947 US Marshall Plan, initiated to save the country from communist fighters that Mr Tsipras Syriza party lionise to this day. Others argue that Mr Tsipras Russia card is but a ploy in bailout talks with Germany and the eurozone. In spite of historic cultural ties and Syrizas Soviet romanticism, analysts think Greece is too tied to the west through EU and Nato membership and too deep in debt for sanctionsdamaged Russia to buy it off as a reliable ally. The Greeks are using Russia as a way to piss off Berlin, to frighten them. Tsipras wants to show he has other options,  Theocharis Grigoriadis, a GreeceRussia relations expert at the Free University of Berlin. But he has no intention of making Greece a Russian satellite. The Russians know that. The Germans know that. It is pure theatre, a Greek game, and Im afraid it looks like a poodle trying to scare a lion. From his first day in office Mr Tsipras administration has stoked Russian paranoia in western capitals. During his debut at an EU foreign ministers meeting, Greeces Nikos Kotzias angrily waved a rolledup Russian sanctions proposal in his hand as he condemned the measures. We argue and squabble but it is like a family, were supposed to share the same world view,  one official present. That meeting was something else it felt like the UN Security Council. Since then Greece has showed restraint and tempered its position. But last week Mr Tsipras made waves by telling Russian news agency ItarTass that sanctions were an unwise road to nowhere. Ticking off another Moscow complaint, Mr Tsipras added that a new European security architecture should also include Russia. Mr Kotzias, a former Piraeus university professor turned Greek foreign minister, is dismissive of sinister speculation over the Tsipras Moscow trip. There are circles that react as if Greece were abandoning the west or wanted to engage in backstabbing, he  at the weekend. There are mistaken stereotypes. Greeces affinity for Russia stretches from religion to politics and dates from the late 18th century, when Catherine the Great briefly acted as protector to some Aegean islands during an imperial Mediterranean push. A tax break was part of the deal: Greek shipowners could circumvent the Ottoman taxman by flying the Russian flag. Almost as longstanding is Greeces trackrecord of flirting with Moscow when its western alliances come under strain. When Nato was seen as too friendly to Turkey in the early 1980s, Andreas Papandreou, Greeces first socialist prime minister, offered Syros islands port facilities to the Soviet navy. Tellingly, that deal was never sealed; a fate shared by many RussoGreek plans. For now, the Kremlin is careful not to feed speculation over loans. Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putins spokesman,  Greeces economic situation and Athens quite tepid attitude towards this [EU] sanctions policy would be on Wednesdays agenda. But he  Russias readiness to offer Greece financial support was uncertain and would depend on Athens request. Russia loaned 2.5bn to Cyprus during its economic travails, a country with which Moscow maintains even closer economic and political ties. Yet to the Nicosias embarrassment, Mr Putin rejected pleas for a bigger loan to avert its full eurozone bailout two  ago. The scale of Greeces economic hole is on a different scale: it is already in receipt of a 172bn bailout programme. The Russians wont want to risk serious money given the possibility of another Greek default and their own present situation,  one senior banker in Athens. But they may agree to buy some Greek treasury bills as the Chinese did recently, as a gesture of support. Moscow says that, although it wants to soften the blow of the fruit ban, a full Greek exemption may be impossible because of global trade rules. Russias food hygiene regulator says planned inspections of Greek producers should not be seen as a sign that the embargo will be lifted early. So far, Moscows main focus is on Turkish Stream, a Putinbacked pipeline to replace the collapsed South Stream, potentially entering the EU through Greece. After a recent Moscow visit, hardleft Greek energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis hailed a new chapter in relations, boasted of securing cheaper gas and Russian bids for deepsea oil prospects in Greece just the kind of exploration EU sanctions are trying to curb. Mr Tsipras Moscow gambit will play well with Greeks cheering his defiance of Brussels and please Syrizas hardleft faction. But Greek analysts doubt Mr Tsipras will agree to anything that would seriously alienate Berlin or Nato. Mr Tsipras, for instance, moved forward his Moscow trip by a month to avoid upsetting EU allies by appearing at Russias second world war victory parade on May 9. There are economic and political advantages for both sides in getting closer but not too close,  Costas Iordanides, a veteran commentator on Greek foreign relations. Typically, the Russians stir things up in Greece whenever theres an opportunity. But they havent ever challenged Greeces relationship with Nato.',\n",
       " 'ASEAN leaders aim to narrow economic gap in region, document says Vivian Ho Kyodo News KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will push for more engagement with the private sector to narrow the gap among their countries as the bloc strives toward a common market by the end of this , according to a draft declaration set to be adopted by the leaders at a summit later this month. Leaders from the 10 member countries in ASEAN are expected to meet in Kuala Lumpur for their annual summit on April 26 before heading to the northern island resort of Langkawi for an informal gathering the next day. Malaysia plays host at a crucial juncture in ASEAN developments as this  marks the deadline for the formal establishment of the ASEAN Community, a project which entails closer integration through political security, and closer economic and sociocultural relations. On economic ties, the leaders agree to \"encourage more engagement and interaction between ASEAN leaders and business leaders including small and medium enterprises to narrow the gaps within and among ASEAN as well as promote the free movement of peoples and skilled labor,\" according to a draft obtained by Kyodo News titled \"Kuala Lumpur Declaration on a PeopleCentered ASEAN.\" The ASEAN Economic Community blueprint envisaged an integrated market and production base with free flow of goods, services and investments, skilled labor and capital. But there is a startling development gap among member countries. For example, Singapore gross national income per capita is 56 times bigger than that of Cambodia. Skeptics have long voiced doubts over ASEAN ambition for closer integration given the grouping sacred stance on sovereignty and the increase in protectionism as national interest trumps regional ambition. But host Malaysia has a plan to integrate the private sector, helping companies to expand across borders. At the ASEAN economic ministers meeting last month, Idris Jala, minister in the Prime Minister Department, presented his \"pathfinder project\" proposal to the ministers where each country identifies 10 companies and gets all 100 to sit together and thrash out their problems trying to expand in other ASEAN member countries. \"Those are basically companies from ASEAN countries that want to expand but have encountered problems such as with approvals and other nontariff barriers. You will only know if you look at it company by company,\" the official news agency Bernama quoted Idris as saying. In addition to the Kuala Lumpur declaration, the ASEAN leaders are also expected to adopt the \"Langkawi Declaration on the Global Movement of Moderates.\" The declaration calls for \"a commitment to democratic values, good governance, equitable economic growth and adherence to social justice\" as a way \"to counter and address the root causes of terrorism, violent extremism and radicalism,\" according to a draft obtained by Kyodo. Southeast Asia has not been spared by extremists\\' violence. Groups like the Indonesiabased Jemaah Islamiyah and the Abu Sayyaf based in southern Philippines have wrought terror. And now, the latest threat is the growing influence of Islamic State militants. Officials say dozens of people in Southeast Asian countries have headed to Syria and Iraq to join IS.

Chile is squabbling with Bolivia. Venezuela is in a protracted state of crisis, while its border with Colombia is rife with smugglers plying a lucrative trade in contraband gasoline. Central America is the most murderous place on earth, thanks to drugtrafficking. The dispute over the Keystone XL pipeline has chilled Canadas relations with the US, while the Caribbean remains a collection of financially precarious states. These are only some of the neighbourly problems that the hemispheres leaders take to Panama this week for the Summit of the Americas. It also makes the meetings theme, the challenges of American cooperation, doubly ironic. Indeed, it has already been agreed that nobody will agree, and therefore there will be no final communiqu an interesting take on mutual support. Nonetheless, this  meeting, a onceeveryfour gathering, is genuinely historic. It will be the first time since the days of Dwight Eisenhower that the US and Cuban presidents will formally meet. Their double billing, at Latin Americas insistence, accompanies moves begun by the US and Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations. The prospect of rapprochement, and an end to the US trade embargo, has weakened the summits usual antiYankee animus one of the few things Latin Americans agree on. More ly, the summit coincides with a significant change in the world economy. For the first time in a decade, the forces shaping global capitalism are in the USs favour rather than in South Americas. The commodity supercycle is ebbing as Chinas economy slows, and what had seemed to be an elixir guaranteeing endless growth has proved a chimera. Even wellmanaged economies, such as Chiles and Colombias, have slowed sharply. Spendthrifts such as Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela have meanwhile suffered more as the mismanagement masked by the commodity boom has been exposed. This economic shift will have powerful political effects, too. It should deflate some of the regions loudest antiUS voices, particularly the Venezuelaled Alba bloc of leftwing countries. It could also mark a reconsideration of US relations among the rest. Much recent Latin American diplomacy has focused on Beijing. It may be a sign of the times that Dilma Rousseff, Brazils embattled president, has  she wants to resume the US state visit that she cancelled two  ago due to US electronic snooping on her emails. By and large, the Americas today enjoy resilient political democracies with reasonably wellmanaged economies, and thriving commercial links. Sadly, Venezuela is an exception. Worse, attempts by its Latin American peers to hold Caracas to their own democratic standards have been meek at best, and more often nonexistent. This pathetic spectacle has sapped arguments for the larger world role that Latin America often claims. US diplomacy, though, has done little better. On March 9, under the legal rubric that it faced an extraordinary threat to?.?.?.?national security, Washington slapped sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials it deemed guilty of human rights abuses. Such unfortunate language gave Nicols Maduro, the Venezuelan president, a sympathy bump across the region. This is doubly absurd. Venezuela is a national security threat only to itself. And if Washington can only sanction foreign officials by declaring a whole country is a threat, then those legal requirements should be changed. Everywhere, the best way to improve cooperation is to begin at home. END',\n",

The April 7 appellate panel report  that Vietnam failed to show that a U.S. law used to comply with WTO dispute decisions was inconsistent with the WTO AntiDumping Agreement. The appellate body  that an earlier dispute settlement report, which found that the U.S. measures were inconsistent with its international obligations, was made objectively and in accordance with WTO rules. “The United States is pleased with this result,”  Andrew Bates, press secretary at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. “We will be closely reviewing the findings in the panel report as we consider options to respond.” Vietnamese trade officials did not respond to Bloomberg BNA request for comment. Commerce ‘Zeroing’ Methods The dispute centers on the U.S. Commerce Department use of “zeroing” methods to calculate the dumping margins of individually examined Vietnamese producers and exporters in three antidumping administrative reviews. Using this methodology, Commerce designates a margin of zero to merchandise sold at higher prices in the U.S. than in the home market. Commerce excludes zero margins in its aggregated calculation of a company weightedaverage dumping margin, which generally leads to higher dumping margins. Though Commerce ceased its use of the zeroing method in the 2006 dumping investigations, it continued to apply the method in administrative reviews and sunset reviews until 2012 (29 WTO, 2/14/12). On Nov. 17, 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)  that such methods violated U.S. obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the AntiDumping Agreement (222 WTO, 11/18/14).

Section 129(c)(1) of the URAA creates a mechanism for U.S. officials to modify Commerce regulations in order satisfy DSB recommendations and rulings.

The URAA only implements modifications to Commerce policies after the date of an adverse WTO ruling, thereby excluding prior imports in its modified antidumping calculations, Vietnam . The WTO appellate panel rejected Vietnam argument that the earlier panel had erred when it found that Section 129(c)(1) did not preclude full implementation of WTO reports. As a result, the appellate body  that it would not address Vietnam request for completion of the legal analysis in order to determine whether Section 129(c)(1) is inconsistent with the AntiDumping Agreement.',\n",
       " 'USTR Official: EGA Parties Have Not Discussed Tariff Phaseouts, Finalized Scope Format World Trade Online Posted: April 07, 2015 Despite their plans to launch formal negotiations on product scope next month, the United States and the other 16 participants in the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) have not yet finalized the format for conducting those talks and have not even discussed the length of tariff phaseouts that will ultimately be applied to products included in a final deal, according to an official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Speaking at an April 7 event hosted by the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), the USTR official  EGA members are still discussing how to structure their firstever round of product scope talks, which will take place the week of May 4 in Geneva. But the official  “ultimately, we will have to be having a linebyline, detailed conversation, but how we\\'re structuring it, we\\'re still thinking through.” One Geneva source indicated last week that EGA members will negotiate over product scope on a linebyline basis and gauge the support of members of each tariff line, sources . The source  EGA members are considering starting with the highestnumbered tariff lines in the Harmonized System and working their way down, although this has not been decided. The USTR official emphasized that discussions so far among EGA members have been on product scope and they have not even decided when they will begin negotiating tariff phaseouts. They have not even decided whether to emulate the phaseout structure used in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) or whether to do something different, the official added. Under the original ITA agreement, the participants agreed to three staging categories to eliminate tariffs for those covered products: immediate, three , and five . In exceptional circumstances, parties were able to negotiate a seven phaseout period. Participants in the negotiations to expand the ITA, which are currently stalled, have also agreed to accept the original 1996 framework. “We haven\\'t gotten into detailed conversations as a group about \\'Is ITA our model? Is there something similar to ITA but not exactly like ITA?\\'” the official . “We haven\\'t had those kinds of detailed discussions.” But the ITA is already serving as a model for the EGA when it comes to calculating the “critical mass” of participants that would be needed to cover the vast majority of trade in environmental goods. The ITA set the threshold for “critical mass” at 90 percent of trade in information technology goods, and USTR officials have repeatedly signaled they are using that threshold as a guideline in the EGA talks. At the April 7 event, the USTR official indicated that EGA members have already passed, or are very close to passing, the 90percent threshold established under the ITA. But the official declined to say what percentage of trade in environmental goods are covered by the current participants. Instead, the official noted that the United States accounts for 11 percent of trade in the 54 environmental goods on which AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries agreed in 2012 to reduce tariffs. That list is the basis of the EGA talks. Based on the APEC list of 54 environmental goods, the original 14 members of the EGA accounted for 86 percent of the global trade in those products. Achieving a critical mass is crucial to the success of the EGA because the tariff cuts made by participants will be extended to all WTO members on a most favored nation basis. If a critical mass is not achieved, then WTO members who do not participate but are major exporters of the covered goods could reap the benefits of the deal without having to lower their own tariffs posing what is known as the \"free rider\" problem. With regard to product scope, the USTR official signaled the United States is cool to the proposals by some EGA members to include agricultural goods in the scope of the EGA. The official did so by saying the U.S. has been focused on nominating industrial goods for tariff elimination. In February, sources  EGA members had nominated agricultural biofuels like biodiesel and methanol, a move which generated some controversy. This is because these products are subsidized in some countries, and some EGA countries may object to lowering tariffs on these goods if those subsidies are not addressed, one informed source . NFTC Vice President Jake Colvin  business groups have been touting the EGA as a way to talk to Democratic members of Congress about trade and why they need to support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). He suggested that congressional Democrats are more likely to be supportive of the EGA than other trade agreements because they support environmental protection and conservation. “We\\'re doing our best to try to engage those members and help articulate the benefits of EGA and \\'by the way, in order for an EGA to get the maximum amount of support it needs, you\\'ll need TPA as well,\\'” he . A USTR spokesman did not respond directly when asked whether implementing the tariff cuts under a final EGA would require legislation. If so, such implementing legislation could ultimately be subject to the fasttrack procedures laid out in a TPA bill. The USTR official, as well as other business supporters of the EGA who spoke at the NFTC event, argued that there is strong bipartisan support for EGA.',\n",
       " 'WTO Case Against China Banking Regs Would Face Pitfalls By Alex Lawson Law360, New York (April 07, 2015, 7:46 PM ET) A momentary truce between the U.S. and China over Beijing controversial rules covering information technology in its banking sector appears to be a welcome development for potential service providers, as experts say a successful World Trade Organization challenge is far from certain. At issue between the two trading powers are a suite of regulations China has rolled out over the last six months ostensibly aimed at bolstering the security of its financial services sector by placing certain restrictions on the type of information technology that can be provided to its banks. The regulations appear to require Chinese banks to prioritize the use of domestic technology over that of foreign providers and require overseas suppliers to hand over source codes and other sensitive intellectual property for its products. While those provisions would appear to run counter to many WTO agreements, China framing of the policy as a security measure could prove to be a roadblock. \"I suspect that this wouldn\\'t work, for the simple reason that it looks to me like China is trying to take a national security slant on this,\"  David Collins, a professor of international economic law at City University London. \"National security is basically the atom bomb of trade discussions. As soon as you raise national security, it basically all bets off.\" The U.S. has already provided a preview of what a full WTO complaint might look like, suggesting in an April 1 report that the banking regulations flout China obligations under the WTO Committee on TradeRelated Investment Measures, or TRIMS, as well as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. On its face, former USTR associate general counsel and current Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP partner Stephen S. Kho  the case against China was rather strong, but whether and how aggressively China would pursue a national security defense was enough of a red flag to give the U.S. pause before pursuing a case. \"The national security argument has always been the \\'get out of jail\\' card, or at least it been viewed that way by WTO members,\" Kho told Law360. \"If they play it, everyone else would assume that the panel would defer to the country that is making that argument.\" The exception, enshrined in Article XXI of GATT, essentially allows WTO members to take actions that violate other WTO commitments as long as it deems those actions to be \"necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\" As a practical matter, a possible challenge from the U.S. or any other party is a long way off. China agreed to delay implementation of the highly contentious measures just a few days after the U.S. delegation formally raised the issue for the first time at the WTO. The administration has been under tremendous pressure from business organizations and lawmakers to address the regulations. But even the delay from China appears to be a limited victory, as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is still awaiting further clarity on how Beijing will proceed. \"We continue to seek China reconsideration of the approach it has taken to regulate information and communication technology equipment in the banking sector,\" a USTR spokeswoman told Law360. \"We trust that the Chinese government will understand the urgency of delaying the implementation of the banking measures, and in such case we encourage them to clarify the status of the measures publicly.\" Collins  that the Chinese regulations appeared to be a prime candidate for a national security defense, citing the WTO relative ineffectiveness as an arena for dealing with disputes featuring novel policy developments and high geopolitical stakes. \"The WTO dispute settlement system is meant to crystallize legal, traderelated disputes and if it something like cybersecurity, I think we are looking at a classic nontrade exception,\" he . However, the prong of the regulations that appears geared toward advancing China policy of \"indigenous innovation,\" or the favoring of domestic industries over foreign ones, is a clear violation of the national treatment principle underpinning the WTO, Kho noted. \"The U.S. side is certainly more comfortable challenging industrial planning,\" Kho . \"There is an industrial planning and economic link to it. It not clear that China is doing this explicitly for national security reasons or if they would be willing to play that card.\" The risk in asking a panel to rule on the national security exception cuts both ways, Kho pointed out, for if China were to raise it as a defense, it would then be opening the door for other countries to do the same in cases it may bring in the future. More broadly, Kho speculated that the accelerated intermingling of economic policy and security policy may mean that the WTO will be forced to weigh in on the contours of the exception sooner rather than later. \"I think every  we inch closer and close to having to deal with the national security question at the WTO,\" he . \"You are starting to hear governments openly talking about this in the cyber world, the IT world, the sanctions world. I think when these issues intersect with trade and countries are utilizing economic sanctions and trade tools to deal with essential security issues, you\\'re going to have this type of discussion.\" Editing by Katherine Rautenberg and Kelly Duncan.',\n",

       " \"Brazil, U.S. Close to Finalizing Bilateral Beef Trade Agreement By Michael Kepp WTO Reporter, April 8, 2015 April 7 — The U.S. and Brazil are close to finalizing a bilateral beef trade agreement that will resolve Brazil longrunning attempt to export beef to the U.S. market, an official at Brazil Agriculture Ministry (MAPA) told Bloomberg BNA. “The USA and Brazil have advanced in negotiations to open beef exports from 14 Brazilian states and we now await U.S. publication of the final version of the agreement,”  a statement from MAPA following the last round of talks at a meeting of the U.S.Brazil consultative committee on agriculture on March 31. Odilson Ribeiro, director of MAPA department of sanitary and phytosanitary international negotiations, told Bloomberg BNA April 7 that “even though we hope to finalize the agreement by the end of April, I am not 100 percent certain of this. But I can say that the agreement is in its final stages and should be finalized soon.” Fernando Sampaio, the executive director of the Brazilian Association of Beef Exporting Industries (ABIEC), a beef exporters' association, told Bloomberg BNA April 6 that “we are fairly sure that the agreement will be signed by [the] end [of] June because all but the smallest details of the negotiations have been settled.” Welber Barral, a Brasiliabased trade consultant and former secretary of foreign trade at Brazil Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, told Bloomberg BNA April 5 that “the agreement is very far along and will be finalized in the next few months, ending Brazil longstanding wait to export unprocessed beef to the U.S. market.” Agreement Will Allow Export of Fresh Beef The accord will allow 14 Brazilian states to export fresh (chilled or frozen) beef, as opposed to processed beef—like canned corned beef—to the U.S. and allow the U.S. to likewise export fresh beef to Brazil. Both countries currently export only processed beef to each other. The accord will be published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as soon as the remaining technical details regarding the international health certificates that must accompany these bilateral fresh beef exports are resolved, Ribeiro told Bloomberg BNA. Brazil has been trying to export fresh beef to the U.S.since 1999; however, isolated cases of foot and mouth disease suspended that attempt. Brazil has blocked beef imports from the U.S. due to limited instances of mad cow disease. In 2010, as part of a deal to end Brazil longrunning World Trade Organization dispute with the U.S. over cotton subsidies, the U.S. agreed to begin the process of opening up its market for fresh beef imports from Brazil. In 2011–2012, the USDA began a risk analysis of the safety of fresh Brazilian beef and in December 2013 published a proposed rule saying that it could be imported safely from 14 Brazilian states, mostly in southern, southeastern and centralwestern regions, provided exporters meet certain conditions. Public consultations about the proposed rule ended in April 2014. Quota for Brazil At the World Organization for Animal Health (OEA) meeting in May 2015, Brazil retained its insignificant risk status for mad cow disease and raised to 24 the number of states that are recognized by the OEA as being free of foot and mouth disease. However, Brazil agreement with the U.S. will only cover fresh beef exports from 14 states because “at this point, it would take too much time to renegotiate the agreement to expand it to cover 24 states, delaying its implementation,” Ribeiro of MAPA told Bloomberg BNA. “After the agreement is in place, we will try to increase the number of states allowed to export fresh beef to the USA from 14 to 24 states.” He added that “thanks to nationwide vaccinations, all of Brazil is free of footandmouth disease but we're still working on the documentation to attest to this in three remaining Amazon states.” Under the agreement, there will be no quota for U.S. fresh beef exports to Brazil, but a quota of 64,000 tons per  will apply to U.S.bound Brazilian fresh beef exports. Sampaio of ABIEC  that “Brazil will have no trouble meeting the 64,000tonper quota and will mainly ship lowfat beef trimmings from pasturegrazed cattle to [the] U.S. market, whose feedlotraised cattle provide highfat trimmings. In the USA both high and lowfat trimmings are blended and ground into hamburger meat.” Ribeiro  that “some of the fresh beef that Brazil exports to the U.S. market will be scraps to be used in other food products, like pizza.” Under the agreement, Brazil will mainly import “rump cap,” also called “top sirloin cap,” from the U.S., both Ribeiro and Sampaio told Bloomberg BNA. Rump cap beef, called “picanha” in Brazil, is a favorite cut whose demand requires Brazil to import some of it from Argentina. “This is an agreement in which both the USA and Brazil gain something because each country will be importing different cuts and types of beef,”  trade consultant Barral. MAPA is in the process of negotiating a similar bilateral beef trade agreement with Canada, Ribeiro .\",\n",
       " \"USTR Calls Out Corruption Problems In EU Members' Procurement Markets World Trade Online Posted: April 07, 2015 The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative called out several European Union member states for maintaining public procurement regimes it charged are unfair, rife with corruption, or fail to consider legitimate factors besides product cost in awarding contracts in its annual report on trade barriers issued last week. USTR 2015 National Trade Estimate (NTE) report identified new or increased barriers to the procurement markets of six EU member states and reiterated procurement issues identified in its 2014 report for six others. Most of them were in Central and Eastern Europe, although France and Italy were also singled out. The criticism comes as the United States and EU are negotiating on government procurement in the context of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks. The EU is seeking greater access to the U.S. federal and subfederal procurement markets as well as an exception to “Buy American” provisions, but the U.S. has thus far been cool and only assented to discussing possible market access improvements later this , according to sources. Poland and Slovakia were newly called out in this  NTE report. It also identified new issues in the Czech Republic, France, Italy and Romania, although those countries received criticism for other procurement issues last . For instance, Italy was again identified as having widespread corruption on the local level, but the report added that “a series of large corruption scandals” in 2014 have led to hundreds of arrests and investigation. “These recent corruption scandals show how deeply rooted corruption still is in public procurement,” the report . In response, Italy government has appointed an anticorruption commissioner and introduced draft legislation to increase corruption penalties, the report . Similarly, the Czech Republic and France were also cited as having new problems with corruption in their procurement processes. France was identified by a February 2014 EU anticorruption report as having to “root out corruption of public procurement contracts at the local level,” the NTE . This includes strengthening its enforcement and increasing its penalties as “French laws that make it a crime to break public procurement rules rarely result in criminal charges and when they do, the punishment is not severe,” according to the NTE. USTR criticized a Czech public procurement reform legislation as maintaining loopholes that could allow bidders to subcontract to anonymously held companies. An October 2014 analysis of the funding for political parties in the Czech Republic lower legislative chamber showed that the sponsors of political parties received about $20 billion worth of public contracts. According to the report, some of those sponsors receiving contracts were registered overseas, did not declare ownership, or had no employees. That reform law adopted by the Czech government in 2012 addressed corruption and transparency issues to some degree. But the threshold above which which these rules apply has subsequently been increased, from $50,000 to $300,000 for construction contracts, according to the report. The 2012 law applied these more stringent public procurement rules to all contracts worth $50,000 and above. But according to USTR 2014 NTE report, the Czech president in 2013 signed an amendment increasing that threshold to $150,000 for construction contracts. In the latest report, USTR  the Czech Senate in 2013 voted to raise the threshold back up to $300,000 for construction contracts and $100,000 for other services. Poland and Romania were also identified by USTR as still failing to comply with new rules under amended EU public procurement directives that would move them away from only awarding contracts based on lowest cost. The EU completed its procurement law reform in early 2014, although member states have until April 2016 to transpose the new rules into their national law, according to the European Commission. U.S. companies operating in Poland allege that Polish officials only consider cost, “often overlooking other  factors, like quality, company reputation, and prior experience in product and service delivery, in bid evaluation,” the report . But USTR also added that Polish officials have indicated that the government will comply with the EU directives in 2015. Romania was also singled out as still failing to comply with those directives and for delaying relevant consultations with stakeholders. Slovakia, which with Poland was the only new member state identified in the report procurement section, was also criticized for lacking consistency in its public procurement regime. According to USTR, U.S. stakeholders have cited “corruption, inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequate transparency, unfair competition, and poor law enforcement as barriers to public procurement opportunities.”\",\n",
       " 'IMF sees low potential economic growth around world * Potential growth in rich economies to edge up to 1.6 pct * Growth potential in emerging markets to fall further * Zero lower bound to remain issue for monetary policy By Anna Yukhananov WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) The world growth potential took a big hit after the 20072009 financial crisis and is likely to lag for , implying that interest rates should likely stay low for quite a while, the International Monetary Fund  in a study on Tuesday. Potential growth, which gauges how fast economies can grow over time without hitting inflationary speed bumps, already was slowing in richer economies before the financial crisis due to aging populations and a drop in technological innovation. But declines in private investment and employment growth cut annual potential growth in these countries to 1.3 percent between 2008 and 2014, half a percentage point lower than before the crisis, according to the IMF study. The study, part of the Fund twicely World Economic Outlook, could frame the discussions over how to boost growth when the world economic policymakers gather in Washington next week for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings. Over the next five , advanced economies\\' annual growth potential should increase to 1.6 percent, still below precrisis growth rates, making it more difficult to cut high public and private debt, the IMF . With interest rates low, \"monetary policy in advanced economies may again be confronted with the problem of the zero lower bound if adverse growth shocks materialize,\" the IMF . It also  weak demand in the euro zone and Japan could prompt even lower potential growth than forecast. The study comes ahead of the Fund global economic forecasts next week. In emerging markets, potential annual growth fell to 6.5 percent from 2008 to 2014, about 2 percentage points lower than before the crisis, and is expected to fall further to 5.2 percent over the next five  as populations age, structural constraints curb capital growth, and productivity slows. A projected drop in growth potential for China, the world second largest economy, could be even deeper as it transitions away from an investmentled economy to a consumptionbased one, the IMF . The Fund urged rich economies to support demand and investment, including more funding for research and development and infrastructure. Emerging economies should also boost infrastructure spending, get rid of excessive regulation, and improve the quality of education, it . (Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Paul Simao)',\n",
       " 'Currency wars: is the US the new victim? Andrew Balls Financial Times April 8, 2015 6:00 am Dollar strength reflects global policy divergence, not direct intervention In September 2010, Guido Mantega, then Brazil’s finance minister, popularised the term “currency wars”. He claimed governments around the world — led by the US — were engaging in competitive devaluations of their currencies. Brazil and other emerging markets, which were doing better at the time, suffered overvalued currencies as a result. Fast forward to today and the US dollar has appreciated on a tradeweighted basis at a faster pace for the past eight months than during any similar period since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. This , more than 20 central banks have eased monetary policy, including the European Central Bank, which at long last launched its quantitative easing programme. Meanwhile, at the US Federal Reserve‘s press conference last month, chairwoman Janet Yellen acknowledged that the US dollar’s strength was part of the reason for downward revisions in the Fed’s growth and inflation forecasts. Is the US now the victim in this continuing currency war? In truth, while a catchy phrase, it is not an altogether helpful one. The dollar’s strength reflects fundamental economic and policy divergence versus the rest of the world, not direct exchange rate interventions. The euro’s weakness, of course, reflects the ECB’s QE, but this policy loosening is not an act of trade war: it is a reaction to the risk of entrenched deflation that the eurozone faces. The US dollar aside, the main message from the Fed in March was that interest rate increases will be on the table, not in April, but at its June, September or December meetings. This cyclical divergence in policy is not surprising. The US is far more advanced in terms of its post2008 crisis rehabilitation compared with other developed countries, and is a primary beneficiary of the decline in energy prices compared with the overall net negative impact on emerging markets. Given that the low level of headline inflation and core inflation, one of the Fed’s preferred measures, is likely to remain below target this  and rise back to 2 per cent in 2016, the Fed has no need to tighten policy sharply. We expect the Fed to start tightening policy in June, September or December, and to proceed at a fairly slow pace, with a rate rise only at every other meeting, at least at the outset. By removing the language on “patience” at its March meeting, the Fed has given itself the flexibility to act without precommitting on the date. Our framework suggests the Fed is likely to move its target federal funds rate to 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent over the next couple of . It will do less than that if there are downside data surprises or an outsized market reaction to its tightening, and more if inflation were to surprise on the upside. Cyclical divergence on fundamentals and on policy is likely to continue to support the US dollar. Conversely, low and indeed negative yields in Germany are likely to continue to encourage investors to look to higheryielding eurozone assets and also to rebalance their portfolios away from the eurozone, which will be reflected in continuing euro depreciation. Of course, a stronger US dollar contributes to tighter overall financial conditions in the US. But, to the extent that they reflect these global spillover effects, a lower level of yields and a flatter US term structure work in the other direction. Other factors, including US companies hedging euro cash piles they do not want to repatriate and a continued decline in the euro’s share of global central banks’ foreign exchange reserves, are likely to reinforce the trend. The dollar was appreciating at a rapid pace at the start of the , before Ms Yellen’s March intervention. It is likely to continue to strengthen, especially as global markets focus on the impending Fed rate rise cycle, but at a more measured pace. Emerging markets are likely to remain under pressure, reflecting the combination of the prospective Fed rate rise cycle, the US dollar’s strength, the lower level of commodity prices and a range of idiosyncratic country risks in what is a highly differentiated asset class. Reflecting myriad challenges for the country, the Brazilian real has depreciated by more than 40 per cent versus the US dollar since Mr Mantega’s currency war complaint in 2010.

In its complaint China  the EU had decided in 2013 to source 96 percent of its readytoeat poultry imports from Brazil and Thailand. The balance of 4 percent was to be divided between China and other nations. Not only was this far lower than the quantity imported from China earlier, it was a trade barrier for the nation poultry producers. Explaining its objection, China  the normal EU customs tariff for seven types of poultry products that come under quotas is between 8 percent and 10.9 percent. However, the tariff goes up to 51.08 percent for the same products without quotas. Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, urged the EU to modify its policy and offer Chinese companies fair treatment. \"China is determined to protect the interests of its poultry companies and hopes the EU will resolve this issue under the WTO rules,\"  Sun. Under WTO rules, the EU has 10 days to respond. If it fails to respond within this period or could not reach a satisfactory result, China can ask for a WTO panel to look into the dispute. China, the world secondlargest poultry producer after the United States, exported poultry products worth $133 million to Europe in 2014. Chinese poultry companies could gain an additional export amount of between $50 million and $150 million if the EU removed its discriminatory distribution measure on import quotas. Eager to increase its market share in the European market, Chinese poultry product companies have invested 2.8 billion yuan ($451 million) to upgrade livestock and source new processing equipment to meet European product standards, according to the Beijingbased Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Foodstuffs and Native Produce. Chen Fuli, deputy directorgeneral of the department of treaty and law at the ministry,  the ministry will enhance its legal service capabilities and risk prevention mechanisms to further protect the interests of Chinese companies in overseas markets. \"We expect China and the EU to deal with the case in an active, pragmatic and flexible manner and create a favorable atmosphere for bilateral business ties from a longterm perspective,\"  Chen. Last month, the EU  it will continue to impose antidumping tariffs as high as 54.1 percent on Chinese steel fasteners for the next five  in its final sunset review. The move came after the EU initiated an investigation against carbon steel fasteners made in China in January 2014 and decided to extend the antidumping duty for another five . Sun Guangbin, deputy secretarygeneral of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products,  the decision was \"very unwise\" as it benefits no one. \"Many European companies have set up their production bases in China, so both Chinese and European companies will suffer from it,\" he , adding that the EU should stop adopting a double standard toward China. Feng Jinyao, head of the China Fasteners Industry Association,  that Europe used to be a big market for China, but Chinese market share in Europe dropped to less than 0.5 percent due to antidumping duties. He  the Ministry of Commerce is likely to impose tariffs on certain EUmade iron and steel fasteners in a titfortat move. China, the world biggest producer of screws, nuts, bolts and washers, produces about 10 million metric tons of fasteners every , and has about 8,000 fastener manufacturers.',\n",
       " 'Industry association opposes EU duty on Chinese fasteners BEIJING, Apr. 8 (Xinhua) The European Union decision to extend an antidumping duty on imports of steel fasteners from China was \"strongly opposed\" by a Chinese industry association on Wednesday. China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, a nongovernment organization, urged the EU to respect the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and rectify its practices. The statement was in response to an EU decision, announced on March 27, to reimpose the duty of as many as 74.1 percent of imports from China for certain steel fasteners, used for a wide range of products from automotive parts to furniture, following an expiry review. \"There is a likelihood of recurrence of dumping to the Union market, should the measures be allowed to lapse,\" the European Commission  in an official statement. The five renewal will take effect on March 28. The EU imposed the antidumping duty for five  in January 2009, prompting the Chinese government to file a complaint against the bloc at the WTO, which ruled against aspects of the EU measures in 2011. As a response, the EU reduced the levies to an average of 54.1 percent from 77.5 percent in 2012.',\n",
       " 'Solar panel imports from China not harming Australian industryregulator SYDNEY, April 9 (Reuters) An investigation by Australia AntiDumping Commission into solar panel imports from China found that the domestic industry wasn\\'t significantly hurt by the purchases, making it likely the probe would be wound up without any punitive tariffs imposed. The finding is a blow for Adelaidebased Tindo Solar, Australia only solar panel manufacturer, which had sparked the probe after complaining about being forced to cut prices to compete with Chinese imports. Following the long investigation, the commission found that the Australian industry suffered a \"negligible\" blow to sales volume, prices, profit and profitability, the regulator  in a report on Thursday. Companies have up to 20 days to respond to the report before the commission can make a final decision on terminating its investigation or recommending whether or not Australia should impose an antidumping duty and the quantum. The United States, Europe and Canada have in recent  imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panel imports, winning the support of manufacturers but angering China, major domestic retailers and installers which rely on cheap goods in large quantities to stay profitable. Selling goods overseas at a loss to take business from local suppliers, or \"dumping\", is legal, according to the World Trade Organisation but authorities can charge tariffs if an industry can prove it has been damaged by the practice. The commission  Tindo performance was affected by its own strategy of timing its foray in a downturn and focusing on the premium end of the market coupled with the fact that Chinese solar panels were available at significantly below Tindo costs, even without dumping. \"The Commission is not satisfied that, in the absence of dumping, Tindo would be able to reduce its selling prices ... to the extent required to ensure its prices are competitive,\" the report . Tindo Managing Director Adrian Ferraretto told Reuters that he was still evaluating the report and considering his next step. \"The size of the market when we entered is a lot bigger than we had estimated in our business plans. I think, people want to buy Australianmade panels. Operating in a fair market, we\\'d definitely have a much bigger market share than what we have now,\" he  by phone on Thursday.

       " 'Russia may lift embargo on agricultural supplies from Greece lawmaker MOSCOW, April 8. /TASS/. Russia is considering lifting an embargo on agricultural supplies from Greece, Cyprus and Hungary, a senior Russian lawmaker  on Wednesday. \"Russia is considering lifting its restrictive measures against agricultural output from three states Greece, Cyprus and Hungary,\" Head of the Committee for International Affairs at the State Duma (the lower house of Russia’s parliament) Alexey Pushkov . Russia introduced a package of countermeasures on August 7 in retaliation to the sanctions imposed by the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union and Norway against Moscow over its stance on developments in neighboring Ukraine. Russia’s countersanctions involve a one ban on food and agricultural imports from the countries that slapped sanctions against Moscow. The Russian lawmaker  the lifting of the food embargo from Greece, Cyprus and Hungary was a serious topic for discussions. Greece, which is a EU member state, has suffered much from Russia’s restrictive measures, Pushkov . \"Owing to the position held by the Greek government, I believe that Russia can consider the possibility of a serious departure from these restrictive measures in relations with these states, first of all, with Greece,\" Pushkov . Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras who is arriving in Moscow for talks with the Russian leadership on Wednesday  in late March that Greece did not back the West’s sanctions against Russia as this was a \"road to nowhere.\" In an exclusive interview with TASS ahead of his upcoming visit to Moscow, the Greek prime minister noted that there was a chance of bringing the trade ties between the two countries to a new level. \"We can have a substantial cooperation that will allow Greece to export its agricultural goods to the Russian Federation,\" Tsipras stressed. \"You know that over the past  a blow was dealt to these relations as the previous governments in my country had not done what they could have done to avoid this senseless sanctions policy, in my opinion, amid tensions in Ukraine,\" he . \"The result of this is the embargo also on the Greek agricultural goods what has seriously damaged the Greek economy,\" Tsipras .

While Mr Tsipras trumpeted his country’s right to engage with Russia despite misgivings from other EU member countries while Moscow was locked in a standoff with the west, Mr Putin dangled the prospect of Russian investment in cashstrapped Greece but  he had no intention of dividing the EU. Mr Tsipras’s visit, just a day before Greece was due to make a €450m payment to the International Monetary Fund, and his criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, had triggered speculation that Moscow could help bail out Athens in exchange for support in blocking an extension of antiRussian sanctions. But while the Greek prime minister repeated his criticism of sanctions, he also appeared to reassure fellow EU members over fears that Greece could break ranks. He  that while Greece was seeking to build “relations of confidence and trust with the Russian Federation”, it remained an EU member and was “complying with all the commitments we have made to the EU”. Mr Putin also dismissed the idea that Russia would prop up Athens with cash in its fight with EU creditors. “The Greek side did not ask us for help,” he . He also dismissed the notion, advanced by some European officials, of using Greece as a Trojan Horse in the EU. “We are not going to use anything within the EU in order to solve the problem of improving our relations with the EU as a whole,” Mr Putin . “The best solution for all would be to stop the sanctions war.” Observers  it was impossible to gauge whether there was a behind the scenes deal. But Russian politicians and analysts acknowledge that finding likeminded allies in Europe is a key foreign policy task for Moscow. “In fact, it is by far not just Greece, Hungary and the Czech Republic that are opposed to sanctions,”  Alexei Martynov, a political scientist at the International Institute of the Newly Established States in Moscow. “A large number of politicians from other EU states think the same, but they only dare say that in the corridors and not publicly.” Mr Putin  he and Mr Tsipras had discussed potential projects in energy such as extending the planned ‘Turkish Stream’ gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey into the EU via Greece. Mr Putin  this would allow Russia to grant loans for related projects, and income from such projects could eventually help Greece pay back debt. Mr Tsipras responded positively to the Russian proposal, saying his country was ready to “build a Greek pipeline for natural gas from the TurkishGreek border”. Both leaders  this would create chances for further investment and the creation of jobs in Greece. However, they  any detail was yet to be worked out by energy specialists on both sides. Mr Putin dashed hopes of an exemption for Greece from Russia’s import ban on western agricultural products and foodstuffs. “We cannot make an exception for any country,” he . However, according to the Russian president, the two governments agreed on joint investments in agroindustry and food production in Russia, which he  would help Greece find its way back into the Russian market. Mr Tsipras is scheduled to meet Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s prime minister, and give a speech at Moscow State University on Thursday.',\n",
       " 'China moves to shore up miners with tax cut Jamie Smyth in Sydney and Lucy Hornby in Beijing Financial Times April 9, 2015 5:37 am China has cut the resources tax it charges its iron ore miners in an effort to support an industry struggling under an onslaught of cheaper and better quality ore from Australia and Brazil. Resource taxes will be cut to 40 per cent of their legally mandated levels, effective May 1, China’s State Council  late on Wednesday. About threequarters of China’s iron ore miners are losing money at current prices, according to industry association estimates, although political pressure from local governments makes it difficult for the companies to suspend production or lay off workers. “This move is part of a broader theme in China where we are seeing state assistance to help struggling coal producers and some aluminium smelters for social or other reasons,”  Daniel Morgan, commodities analyst at UBS. “It suggests smaller producers in the rest of the world will have to cut production to fix the oversupply problem in the iron ore market.” For overseas miners, especially in Australia where huge capacity increases have come online, the reduced taxes in China could prolong a bruising period of low prices. According to people in Beijing familiar with matter, the Western Australian government has made a series of overtures to Beijing to ensure Chinese conglomerate Citic does not close down its large and lossmaking SinoIron project, a major taxpayer. The state government recently introduced a royalty relief scheme aimed at helping junior miners to cope with a fall in prices that means most are producing at a loss. BC Iron, a Perthbased miner,  last week that the government scheme would defer A$8mA$10m in royalties for up to two . Prices of iron ore — the main ingredient in steel, and Australia’s top export — have fallen 70 per cent since peaking at roughly $190 a tonne in February 2011. That has piled pressure on a host of small Australian miners, which rapidly expanded production during a decadelong mining boom driven by China’s rapid economic growth. On Tuesday, Australian miner Atlas Iron requested a suspension of trading in its shares while it reviews its operations and capital, as well as proposing asset sales “in light of the recent rapid fall in the iron ore price”. Last month, Fortescue, Australia’s thirdbiggest iron ore producer, scrapped a $2.5bn bond and refinancing, blaming the fall in iron ore prices and jitters in capital markets. The fallout in the sector has opened a bitter debate in Australia between the two biggest producers Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton and their competitors. BHP and Rio have rejected calls by Fortescue and others for a halt to their expansion plans, saying that would enable other international producers to fill the gap. Due to their lower cost of production, Rio and BHP have remained profitable in spite of the fall in iron ore prices.',\n",

This will be the first such meeting since the new Trade Commissioner took office. The issue was agreed at the Joint SubCommittee on Trade Cooperation on 27 March in Brussels. Cochaired by the Ambassador of Togo to the EU, Kokou Nayo M'beou and Director at the European Commission DG Trade Marc Vanheukelen, the subcommittee also considered several critical issues for trade cooperation between the ACP and EU countries. Members reviewed the negotiations and implementation of the ACPEU Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), including the current state of play and future prospects, noting that regional trade talks had recently been concluded for West Africa (ECOWAS), Southern Africa (SADC) and the Eastern African Community. The EU set a deadline of October 2016 for signing, ratifying and implementing these set of EPAs. Discussions explored how to move forward on obstacles in the implementation of the full EPA with the Caribbean region (CARIFORUM) and the interim EPAs of the Pacific and Eastern & Southern Africa (ESA) regions. The European Commission gave updates on the ongoing negotiations with the United States under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), as well as the implementation of the EU reformed GSP Scheme which entered into force on 1 January 2014. It was revealed that despite the anticipated benefits of the revised GSP scheme for ACP member states, including the Everything But Arms for Least Developed Countries, the utilisation of such schemes was only 23% on average. The meeting also addressed technical aspects related to rules of origin, and market access and accompanying measures related to five key ACP commodities, namely sugar, bananas, cashew nuts, kava and cotton. Both sides exchanged views on the implementation of the outcomes from the 9th WTO ministerial meeting in Bali in 2013, and discussed preparations for the 10th meeting to be held in Nairobi, Kenya from 1518 December 2015. The report of the SubCommittee meeting will be tabled at the upcoming Joint ACPEU Committee of Ambassadors scheduled for 17 April..... (ACP SECRETARIAT)\",\n",

The Parisbased international thinktank  development assistance stood at $135.2 billion last  after hitting an alltime high of $135.1 billion in 2013. But official development assistance to the poorest countries extended its recent drop and fell by eight percent, fuelled by a 16 percent decrease in bilateral aid exacerbated by high debt relief for Myanmar. Of the 28 members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 13 increased their overseas aid last  while 15 cut it back. OECD SecretaryGeneral Angel Gurría, however,  it was encouraging that development aid remained at a historic high when donor nations were emerging from a severe economic crisis. \"Our challenge ... this  will be to find ways to get more of this aid to the countries that need it most and to ensure we are getting as much as we can out of every dollar spent,\" he  in a statement. The largest donor countries by volume in 2014 were the United States, which spent $32.7 billion, followed by Britain, Germany, France and Japan. Bilateral aid to the African continent fell by 5 percent to $28 billion of which $25 billion went to subSaharan Africa. \"Alarm bells should be ringing at this shocking drop in aid going to the least developed countries,\"  Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director of development advocacy ONE Campaign. \"DAC new figures show a $6.7 billion drop in aid to the least developed countries. That means that in 2014, aid to the very poorest countries was cut by $128 million every week enough to vaccinate 6 million children.\" Bilateral aid is given directly to countries by donor countries and equals twothirds of the OECD official development assistance (ODA). These funds make up more than two thirds of external financing for the world poorest countries. Antipoverty charity Oxfam criticised rich countries for failing to meet their commitments to the world poorest people. \"Aid saves lives. What we\\'re seeing is shameful indifference on the part of many of the world richest nations. Their leaders are breaking with impunity the solemn promise they made to help Make Poverty History,\"  Max Lawson, Oxfam head of global policy and campaigns. \"France should be particularly ashamed with aid falling for the fourth consecutive .\" Only five European Union states have met a target set under the 2015 U.N. Millennium Development Goals to spend 0.7 percent of income on aid. These are Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and Britain. \"The EU aid promise to poor countries has been another victim of austerity,\"  Zuzana Sladkova, a spokeswoman for CONCORD, the European NGO confederation for Relief and Development. \"The figures are a huge blow to the credibility of the EU and its member states during a critical  when several major negotiations regarding the future of development and climate finance are taking place.\" The United Arab Emirates again reported the highest spending on an income level in the 34member OECD even though it reduced its aid rate to 1.17 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1.34 percent. The drop was due to lower lending to Egypt. A survey of donor spending plans through 2018 indicated aid to the poorest countries should recover over the next few  after several  of declines which member countries have decided to reverse, the OECD . \"Official development assistance remains crucial for the poorest countries and we must reverse the trend of declining aid to the least developed countries,\" DAC chairman Eric Solheim  in a statement.

       " 'Switzerland becomes first to sell 10 debt at negative yield Elaine Moore and Ferdinando Giugliano in London Financial Times Last updated: April 8, 2015 6:32 pm Switzerland has become the first government in history to sell benchmark 10 debt at a negative interest rate, as falling prices and unprecedented action by the world’s major central banks send global markets further into unknown terrain. Bonds with negative yields have become one of the world’s fastest growing asset classes, accounting for around a quarter of Europe’s government debt market. In the last  Germany, Austria, Finland and Spain have all sold shorterterm debt at subzero yields. But this is the first time that investors were effectively charged for lending money to a government for such a prolonged period. They bought SFr232.51m (€222.4m) of Swiss debt that will not be repaid until 2025 at a yield of 0.055 per cent — and the issue was comfortably oversubscribed. The rush into European bonds is the consequence of the global slide in inflation, which has made it easier for investors to accept negative yields as they expect prices to rise slowly in the future. Prices in Switzerland fell by 0.9 per cent in the  to March, while inflation in the eurozone stood at 0.1 per cent. Policy makers have responded to the fall in prices by cutting interest rates and launching programmes of asset purchases. The European Central Bank last month bought €52.5bnworth of government bonds, as part of its €1.1tn quantitative easing scheme to revive the eurozone economy. In anticipation of the ECB’s announcement of full blown quantitative easing in January, the Swiss National Bank lowered the interest rate it charges on deposits to 0.75 per cent while removing its currency ceiling against the euro. The US Federal Reserve continues to eye an increase in interest rates in 2015, but minutes from its March Federal Open Market Committee meeting show that weakening economic activity since the start of the  has made some policy makers more cautious. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan remains in easing mode, as it presses ahead with assetpurchases worth Y80tn a . “We have unconventional central bank policies at work so you have to expect unconventional outcomes,”  Steven Major, global head of fixed income research at HSBC. “One is that bonds are no longer trading like bonds. They now trade like commodities — with investors speculating on the price.” The Swiss issue followed an equally remarkable auction by the Spanish government this week, with Madrid issuing shortterm debt at a negative yield less than three  after requesting an international loan to rescue its struggling banking system. Policy makers have moved to take advantage of the cheap borrowing rates available on capital markets by accelerating public borrowing schedules and taking out record amounts of longer term debt. Meanwhile, investors such as pension funds and insurance companies say the trend has forced them to take on greater risk in search of adequate returns. “How much this matters across wider markets and how long it will last is something strategists are wrestling with,”  James McAlevey, head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors. “Bond markets are heavily distorted by government policies. They won’t return to normal until central banks start raising interest rates again.” END',\n",
       " 'Doha Work Program By July Seen As Tall Order By U.S. Commodity Groups Inside U.S. Trade 04/10/2015 Following meetings in Geneva, representatives of U.S. rice and wheat growers this week signaled they were skeptical that the World Trade Organization can meet its July 31 deadline to develop a work program to complete the Doha round because there is no indication that key players like the U.S. and China are working bilaterally to find a way forward. In an April 8 press briefing, Craig Thorn, a partner at DTB Associates who advises clients in the agricultural sector on trade issues,  he doubted that members were at that stage, which would signal increased momentum on the Doha work program. \"You\\'ll know that things are getting serious when you see some bilateral [engagement] between key players like the U.S. and China,\" Thorn . \"I don\\'t know if that happened yet. I doubt it.\" After the press briefing, USA Rice Chief Operating Officer Bob Cummings  if WTO members miss the July 31 deadline, they could push it back to maybe even the Nairobi ministerial. Other observers have  that any progress on the Doha work program can only come if the U.S. and China find a balance between U.S. demands that China do more as a major economy and China refusal to make major concessions beyond its commitments to enter the WTO in 2001. Beyond that, other sources have  that real progress on the work program can only be made when the five major players the U.S., China, the European Union, Brazil, and India are negotiating to find the middle ground between concessions and sensitivities. Thorn  that based on conversations he had with Geneva WTO delegations during a February visit, it is clear there is no consensus on whether the agriculture negotiations should be based on the 2008 draft modalities on agriculture, known as Rev. 4, or on an alternative approach. That point was also made clear at an informal special session of the agriculture committee held on Jan. 28 where China and India endorsed Rev. 4. At that meeting, the U.S.  it would only accept an agriculture text that includes concessions from developingcountry members that currently maintain significant domestic subsidies and have the production capacity to influence global trade (Inside U.S. Trade, Feb. 27). The United States has rejected the 2008 agriculture modalities because they would leave untouched the domestic subsidy programs of the socalled advanced developing countries such as China, Brazil and India, even though the U.S. considers them to have exponentially increased their domestic subsidies. In contrast, the U.S. would be the only country that would have to cut its subsidies programs under the 2008 modalities, which Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Punke has called a \"mindboggling imbalance.\" He noted that there has to be a distinction between developing countries and advanced developing countries that have significant subsidies programs and the productive capacity to affect global trade. A Jan. 28 paper by the Cairns group concluded that the U.S. would be the only country under the 2008 modalities that would have to cuts its overall trade distorting domestic subsidies, which consists of the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), de minimis supports and blue box measures. It examined the affect of the 2008 modalities on the subsidies programs of the U.S., European Union, China, India, Brazil and Japan. In the press briefing, the representatives of U.S. Wheat Associates and USA Rice echoed the demand of USTR that advanceddeveloping countries cut domestic subsidies programs to an extent similar to developed countries. But Thorn acknowledged that these countries have shown no interest in doing so and instead insist that there should be no distinction among developing countries, which should all take on the same obligations under Doha. However, he  that this resistance to stratification is illplaced given the fact that a \"least developed countries\" group has long been given special treatment among developing countries. U.S. Wheat Associates and USA Rice backed their demands on advanced developing countries by focusing on an updated DTB study that shows China, Brazil, India, Thailand and Turkey to have domestic subsidy programs in excess of their WTO commitments to negotiators in Geneva. That study, which was updated in November 2014, analyzed the corn, rice and wheat crops of those countries and determined that the AMS of those crops receive are in excess of the levels those countries have agreed to under the Uruguay Agreement. During their midFebruary visit to Geneva, the commodity group representatives presented this study to negotiators there to offer a new narrative because negotiators are currently working with outdated information, Cummings . This is because several countries are behind in notifying the WTO of their domestic subsidy programs. For instance, China has only submitted its domestic support or export subsidy notifications up to 2008, according to the study. Thorn, Cummings and U.S. Wheat Associates Vice President of Policy Shannon Schlect also  that USTR should focus on enforcing the current WTO obligations, but stopped short of calling for a case before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and only offered \"public shaming\" as a possible alternative. These alleged violations should be addressed through the negotiating process and the U.S. should seek to include stricter disciplines in a potential agriculture agreement, Thorn . One possible way to address domestic support programs in the context of Doha is to cut the de minimis level of domestic subsidies for developing countries more.',\n",

My most of the attention is on market access issues. I hope we will have some reform of rules as well on the agenda for the next WTO ministerial meeting,\"  Additional Secretary in the Department of Commerce, J S Deepak. He was speaking at the inauguration of 2day International Conference on Trade Remedy Measures, organised by the India Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT). After notching up a major victory on food security last  at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), India wants to push for the longpending Doha agenda. The Doha round of negotiations, launched in 2001, has been virtually stalled since July 2008. It collapsed due to differences between the rich and the developing nations, including India, mainly at the level of protection for farmers in developing countries and duty cut on industrial goods. There are a number of pending issues under the Doha round, which India would like to bring to the table in Nairobi. It includes issues related to agriculture (export subsidies, cotton and fishery subsidies), intellectual property rights, market access and services. The rich nations are asking for a significant reduction in industrial good tariffs and further strengthening of patent laws. India also wants to resolve issues of the least developed countries (LDCs). Talking about trade remedial measures such as antidumping duty, Deepak  that with the slowdown in global economy, dumping of goods will not only continue, but also grow. \"We are one of the largest users of antidumping instruments, but I do not see any conflict in this because if the instrument is properly used, there is no way it leads to protectionism,\" he .',\n",
       " 'China Suggests Talks On Phaseout Periods To Restart ITA Expansion Effort Inside U.S. Trade 04/10/2015 Amid a lingering stalemate in the Genevabased negotiations to update the 1996 Information Technology Agreement (ITA), China has floated the idea of holding a renewed round of talks that would include discussions both on which products should be in an expanded ITA and the length of the tariff phaseouts for those products. This approach, Geneva sources , seems to signal that Beijing may be willing to accept duty elimination on sensitive products it has previously insisted are off the table provided that it can secure longer phaseout periods for those goods and potentially other products as well. China put forward this idea during a March 30 meeting among the World Trade Organization ambassadors of all the roughly two dozen countries participating in the ITA talks But Geneva sources  this idea received a cool reception from the United States and the European Union, which indicated they want to first secure agreement on what the expanded ITA will cover before discussing the phaseout periods. However, one source  these countries have not formally responded to China proposal. Shortly after the talks fell apart in December, ITA expansion participants asked World Trade Organization DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo to conduct consultations with members in order to find a way forward. As part of these consultations, the U.S., EU, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan met for a working lunch on Jan. 29. Geneva sources  Azevedo will conduct more consultations once the WTO returns from its Easter break, but his schedule has not been set yet. ITA expansion participants are now eyeing two upcoming meetings where capitallevel ministers could reach a deal and end the current stalemate the May 2324 meeting of AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers in the Philippines, and a June 34 meeting of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. One Geneva source  he expects ITA members like the U.S. and the EU to press China, Korea and Taiwan harder to make a deal as the ministerials get closer. But at the same time, this source  China has made clear it cannot grant major concessions to Korea and Taiwan and that the three parties have still been unable to identify products that are both significant for Seoul and Taipei and not sensitive for Beijing. Even while the ITA expansion talks have remained deadlocked over the inclusion of a handful of commercially significant items, Geneva sources indicated that very little work has been done with respect to phaseout periods in the interim. In essence, the only thing participants have agreed to is that products will fall into one of three tariff elimination phaseout categories immediate, three , and five  reflecting the framework of the original 1996 deal. In exceptional circumstances, parties were able to negotiate a seven phaseout period. If ITA participants decide to go along with China new idea and start making progress with regard to phaseout periods, the talks must still address a key sticking point: China unwillingness to eliminate duties on flatpanel displays. This hardline position on the part of Beijing led to a scramble in December last  between China, South Korea and Taiwan the latter two of which are major flatpanel exporters to find a deal to eliminate duties on other products that Seoul and Taipei could consider commercially meaningful enough to substitute for flatpanel displays. China, however, ultimately  it had no flexibility to go beyond the understanding on product scope it reached with the U.S. on the sidelines of the APEC forum meeting in November 2014. As a result, the expansion talks collapsed for the third time since their inception in 2012. A Geneva source warned that the talks could further stagnate if the stalemate is not resolved before the WTO departs for its summer break in August. The longer it takes to reach a deal, he added, the more likely the hightech products currently under negotiation become obsolete and less commercially meaningful. After the WTO returns from its summer break, members will begin focusing more on the upcoming ministerial in Nairobi, Kenya. \"Are we going to be able to focus on substantial negotiations in the ITA? That something I\\'m not sure about,\" he .',\n",
       " 'China Seeks WTO Consultations With EU Over Tariffs on Poultry Exports to Europe By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, April 10, 2015 April 8 — China filed a new trade dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over European Union tariffs on imports of Chinese poultry meat products. The dispute stems from a pair of EU decisions over the past decade to modify its tariff concessions for imports of poultry. Both the EU and China are among the world top producers of poultry meat. China claimed that in both cases the EU failed to adequately negotiate or consult with China prior to making its decisions, violating the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A request for consultations is the first step in a dispute at the WTO dispute settlement system. The EU must respond to the request within 10 days, after which the two countries shall enter into consultations within 30 days after the request is received. An EU official confirmed to Bloomberg BNA that they had received China request and would enter into consultations regarding the matter. EU Consulted With Brazil, Thailand, Not China In 2003, the EU adopted new regulations to reclassify certain poultry products under a higher tariff category for salted meat. The EU subsequently modified its consolidated duties in 2006 after it lost WTO disputes filed by Thailand and Brazil and opened new tariffrate quotas for imports of poultry products. In 2008, the EU responded to a surge of imported poultry meat by imposing new tariffs on processed poultry meat products. The EU consulted with Brazil and Thailand prior to modifying its tariffs because they had a “principal or substantial supplying interest” in the products under consideration. The EU did not negotiate its tariff modifications with China because, unlike Brazil and Thailand, China did not issue any statement of interest at the time. On April 8, Chinese Ministry of Commerce Spokesman Sun Jiwen  the EU measures “damaged the trade interests of poultry production and export enterprises in China” and the matter had not been resolved despite repeated negotiations with the EU.',\n",

The U.S. will formally request the panel at a April 22 Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) meeting, these sources . The U.S. and China held two rounds of consultations over the demonstration bases program on March 13 and April 12, but they failed to resolve the dispute, Geneva sources . That came after the U.S. first requested consultations with China over the matter on Feb. 11. Under Article 4.4 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the dispute can be referred to the DSB for \"immediate establishment\" of a panel if the consultations do not resolve the dispute within 30 days of a request, unless the DSB decides by consensus not to establish it. This is a different practice than other disputes that are governed solely by the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, in which a respondent country can reject a first panel request but not a second one. In the dispute, known as DS489, the U.S. is claiming that China has provided more than $1 billion in subsidies between 2010 and 2012 to producers in seven different sectors operating in the demonstration bases. In order to receive this support, according to the U.S., the producers were required to meet a certain export performance criteria.

       " \"Canada Top Court Rejects Class Action Over Eliminating Wheat Board Monopoly By Peter Menyasz WTO Reporter, April 10, 2015 April 9 — The Supreme Court of Canada has refused to consider certification of a class action lawsuit attacking the federal government elimination of the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly on western Canadian wheat and barley exports (Edward Andrew Ellis et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen, Supreme Court of Canada, No. 36208, leave to appeal denied 4/9/15). The top court April 9 refusal to hear an appeal of rulings by the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court of Canada that rejected certification of a class action lawsuit by grain producers upholds the government support for the freedom of western Canadian farmers to choose how they market their production, federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz  April 9. “Marketing freedom is and will remain the law of the land,” Ritz  in a statement. “The overwhelming majority of farmers have embraced the new economic opportunities created by marketing freedom and are taking Canadian agriculture to record heights.” The Supreme Court refusal of leave to appeal, for which it traditionally does not provide reasons, upholds a November 2013 decision by the Federal Court of Canada refusing to certify most of a C$17 billion ($13.6 billion) class action brought in 2012 by grain producers against the government overhaul of the Wheat Board. The Federal Court ruling was upheld in October 2014 by the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court struck down all but one element of the proposed class action on the ground that there was no reasonable cause of action. It dismissed the producers' claims of unlawful expropriation of the Wheat Board assets, conversion of property in which the claimants had an interest, unjust enrichment, unlawful interference with the claimants' economic interests and breach of trust. The only element of the class action claim allowed by the Federal Court, representing about C$100 million ($80 million) of the damages claimed, was for mismanagement of the Wheat Board finances in the 2011–2012 crop  by using the claimants' funds to reorganize the grain marketing agency, transferring money to a contingency fund and failing to make required payments to producers. Saskatchewan Court of Queen Bench rejected in June 2014 another proposed class action, launched in January 2012, seeking C$15.4 billion ($12.3 billion) in damages based on allegations that the federal government failed to properly compensate producers after unilaterally dismantling the Canadian Wheat Board assets (6 WTO, 1/11/12). The Canadian Parliament passed into law on Dec. 15, 2011, the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act, which ended the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly on the marketing of western Canadian wheat and barley products. The legislation didn't eliminate the agency, leaving it as a voluntary option for western Canadian producers.

U.S. President Barack Obama  he would seek to promote competitiveness and trade in the region during his participation in the April 1011 Summit of the Americas in Panama City, touting them as keys to spurring development and narrowing the gap between rich and poor. In an interview with Efe, Obama  he was convinced that the best way to close that gap is to \"unleash broadbased economic growth that creates new opportunities and to expand access to the tools people need to lift themselves out of poverty, including education, skills and job training.\" To that end, he  the United States \"will be encouraging all the countries in the Americas to ratify the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement,\" a deal that was agreed in December 2013 at a World Trade Organization meeting in Bali and which is aimed at facilitating the flow of goods across borders, reducing bureaucracy, and thus boosting global trade volumes. At least twothirds of the WTO 160 members must ratify the agreement for it to take effect, but to date the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong are the only ones to do so. \"Economic growth, trade and a shared commitment to expanding opportunity has lifted countless millions of people from poverty. Since 2002, the middle class has nearly doubled, and countries like Brazil and Mexico have middle class majorities for the first time in history,\" Obama . But despite the region wealth, \"about a third of people across the region still endure grinding poverty, and it still too hard for them to access the education, health care and basic service their families need,\" the president added. \"This isn\\'t just a drag on economic growth, it a moral challenge to us all,\" he . Obama  the United States is encouraging the countries of the Americas to establish trade relations with Europe, Africa, India, and Asia. \"It can mean more prosperity and opportunity for us all,\" he added. Obama also noted that the United States is partnering with Canada, Chile, Mexico and Peru to wrap up a 21stcentury trade agreement in the TransPacific Partnership, and he  it is \"leading the international effort to support Caribbean nations as they secure their energy future.\" The president also pointed to his administration efforts to support smallbusiness growth, saying that \"our Small Business Network of the Americas is helping grow 250,000 small businesses throughout the region, and our WEAmericas initiative is helping to empower women entrepreneurs.\" \"My trip this week will build on this work.\" The region opportunities and challenges \"can only be solved by all of us working together, in a spirit of shared responsibility and that includes addressing the injustice of economic inequality,\" Obama . \"I think this summit can build on the incredible progress the region has made in recent decades.\"',\n",
       " 'Administration Touts ExportDriven Jobs in Quest for Support on Trade By Nick Timiraos 9 April 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News Some 11.7 million jobs were supported by exports last , with almost 10% of those jobs coming from Texas, according to a report released by the Obama administration on Thursday. The statebystate look at the benefits of exports was another blast in the administration concerted campaign this week to build support for its trade agenda as Congress begins to debate whether to grant President Barack Obama expanded trade promotion authority in coming weeks. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker told reporters Thursday she expected the Senate could unveil a draft of a bill to ease the passage of trade agreements early next week. \"We\\'re anxiously awaiting to see the language,\" she . The state analysis of trade showed California, Washington, New York and Illinois rounded out the top five states with jobs supported by exports last , behind Texas. Those five accounted for more than 25% of all exportbacked jobs, according to the report, which was compiled by the Commerce Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The report also provides a breakdown by state of exports to the 11 other countries who are negotiating the TransPacific Partnership, or TPP, a trade deal with Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and other Pacific rim nations. The Obama administration is pursuing legislation known as trade promotion authority that allows for upordown votes on trade deals. Obtaining socalled \"fast track\" authority would give the U.S. the leverage to \"speak with one voice...and make sure we can get the best deal\" on the TPP,  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman on Thursday. The fast track legislation faces opposition from many Democrats, labor unions and environmental groups. Activists have targeted Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is the top Democrat on the Senate panel that oversees trade policy. Conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives pose another threat to the White House. While Republicans tend to support trade broadly, several conservatives say they\\'ve lost faith in President Barack Obama international negotiating abilities and are reluctant to hand him greater authority. Thursday report followed a speech the day before by Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, touting the benefits of trade in boosting productivity and innovation. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter warned that the U.S. risked losing influence in Asia if the White House couldn\\'t secure the trade promotion authority needed to conclude the TPP. \"Time is running out,\" he . \"We already see countries in the region trying to carve up these markets.\"',\n",

The remarks by Mr. Tsipras, whose government is in tense negotiations with European officials over a deal to supply Athens with more rescue funds, underscored the defiant tone of his twoday trip to Moscow, where he has criticized European sanctions and stressed Russia and Greece shared cultural and religious roots. \"We used the small force we have to help avoid further sectoral sanctions,\" Mr. Tsipras  Thursday, in comments carried by Russian state news agencies. \"You probably know that the position of the new Greek government is that sanctions don\\'t lead anywhere, they\\'re a dead end.\" European officials  at the time that there was no strong momentum behind sanctions amid a push for a new peace deal between Ukraine government and Russiabacked separatists, which was signed in February. Greece supported a plan agreed to by European leaders last month to maintain existing sanctions. \"The European Union unity when it comes to restrictive measures has been confirmed regularly, including with the new Greek government,\"  Maja Kocijancic, the EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs. Mr. Tsipras trip, a rare official visit by an EU leader to Moscow after Russia annexed Crimea last spring, highlighted the careful balance he is trying to strike in seeking to bolster relations with the Kremlin and demonstrate an independent streak, without doing significant damage to his ties in Europe. Russian officials recognize there is little hope that Greece would block any EU moves on sanctions while its finances are reliant on decisions by European leaders. The visit comes as Greece met a deadline for repaying part of its loan from the International Monetary Fund. The repayment of about 460 million euros ($494 million) had been due Thursday. But freeing up money to repay the IMF and other creditors has forced Athens to delay other domestic spending as its cash reserves continue to dry up. Mr. Tsipras visit, which included a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, has produced no major announcements. Both sides  Greece hadn\\'t requested financial assistance, and Moscow gave no indication it was ready to fulfill requests from Athens to reduce the price Greece pays for natural gas or to exempt Greek producers from a ban on agricultural imports from the EU.',\n",

While global growth is running at roughly the average of the last three decades, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde  it isn\\'t enough to surmount stubbornly high jobless rates, hefty debt burdens and stagnating growth in several of the world largest economies. \"We must prevent that new mediocre from becoming the \\'new reality,\\'\" Ms. Lagarde  in a prepared speech to the Atlantic Council ahead of next week semiannual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. \"All policy space and levers must be utilized,\" she . The IMF chief  fund economists expect stronger growth in the U.S. and U.K. and improving prospects for the eurozone. But they are downgrading the growth outlook for many major emergingmarket economies, including China, Brazil and Russia. The IMF is scheduled to update its January forecasts in a detailed global growth outlook on Tuesday. Ms. Lagarde  financial risks to the global economy were rising, particularly amid a prolonged era of lowand in some cases negativeinterest rates. \"These foster a higher risk tolerance on the part of investors, which can lead to overpricing,\" she . If low interest rates persist, she  life insurers and defined benefit pension funds could soon face solvency challenges.

       " 'IMF chief urges US to act on free trade deals The Straits Times It could lose out on investments with failure to reach agreement THE United States has much to lose if it fails to reach agreement on two landmark free trade deals, International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde has warned, while raising concerns that global trade growth continues to underperform. Speaking at the Atlantic Council on Thursday ahead of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington next week, she told the audience that this  is set to be the fourth consecutive  in which growth in trade around the world will fall below the longterm average. \"There are potentially huge global gains to be had from further trade reform and integration... Yes, the political economy of these reforms is difficult. Yes, they involve tough choices and tradeoffs, and shortrun winners and losers. But in the long run, everybody wins,\"  Ms Lagarde. The World Trade Organisation  last September that trade was likely to grow just 4 per cent this , well short of the 20 average of 5.3 per cent. Ms Lagarde, turning her attention to the US, warned that the world largest economy could end up losing out on investments if it continues to dally on the TransPacific Partnership deal with 11 countries in the AsiaPacific and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. \"If I\\'m a big US corporate and I want to invest and I know there is a big market out there in the east... if there is no facilitation of trade, if there are no better tariff arrangements and no alignment of standards around the world, instead of investing in the US, I\\'m going to look at other investment opportunities and probably invest where there are very serious growing markets,\" she . \"To those who say it is going to reduce employment, it going to be bad for labour, I don\\'t think so. I really don\\'t.\" The IMF managing director sees trade as one of the key areas which governments could focus on to try to help the global economy break out of sluggish growth. While noting that the global economy is in better shape today than during the IMF last meeting in October last , thanks to a strong US economic performance and low oil prices, she  the growth figures are not good enough. \"So the global recovery continues, but it is moderate and uneven. In too many parts of the world, it is not strong enough... \"Six months ago, I warned about the risk of a \\'new mediocre\\' low growth for a long time. Today, we must prevent that new mediocre from becoming the new reality.\" And while macroeconomic risks have gone down, financial and geopolitical risks are rising. For instance, Ms Lagarde , sharp recent swings in foreign exchange rates coupled with an impending rise in US interest rates could be a source of instability. In a wideranging speech that traditionally gives a glimpse into the agenda of the coming meetings, Ms Lagarde repeated her call for the US to ratify the 2010 IMF quota reforms. She stressed that at a time when some in the US are concerned that the rise of institutions like the Chineseled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is eroding the US\\' role in the global economic system, it cannot continue to clog up IMF reforms. The reforms increase the total mandatory contributions to the fund and adjust contributors\\' share to better reflect the growing importance of emerging economies. But some US lawmakers oppose the increase in America contribution and worry that the changes would dilute US influence. Without US ratification, the fund has had to rely on ad hoc loans for its programmes. \"We now wait for only one ratification by the US Congress. It is overdue. So if you meet any of them, tell them,\"  Ms Lagarde.',\n",
       " 'Waning Trade Forbes Asia Asia \"trade\" news of late has focused on a Chinadriven Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), supposedly a trump to U.S. and Japanese efforts to keep the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as the primary such funder in the region. American allies have peeled away to join in the Chinese effort. This may have less economic than political meaningthe ADB has had rather little to do with the region remarkable advances in recent decades, and the AIIB may struggle with similar practices. Meantime, a more significant setback for the U.S. and for real trade progress is shaping up in the likely stall and possible demise of the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), a trade zone of 12 or more countries that could have had meaningful effect. We know that because of the concerted campaign that labor unionists and other nativists have mounted against the pact, in the U.S. particularly. The \"fast track\" authority being sought by President Barack Obama, a procedural device necessary to gain congressional approval of complex trade pacts, is running afoul of his own Democratic Party as well as a bloc of Republican yahoos who don\\'t like him or don\\'t like international law or don\\'t like foreign competition. TPP was earlier seen as an antiChina ploy, as its terms were thought designed to keep the world secondbiggest economy out of the new trade regime. The AIIB was in some sense a reaction. But it now is apparent that the Americans are quite able to undercut their own initiative, thank you. Trade in general is suffering a lapse as global economies struggle and currencies gyrate in a depreciation contest. TPP gasps only add to the funk. Perversely, one sort of commerce thriving of late in much of Asia is armaments. In summarizing Lee Kuan Yew significance for Singapore and Asia, I defer to Steve Forbes on page 10. I\\'ll add that it useful to hold opposed ideas in mind at the same time, per F. Scott Fitzgerald.

       " 'TPP deal urgent with US election  nearing: PM Business Times Singapore THE 12 countries involved in the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) have a duty to convince their respective populations that this proposed free trade agreement (FTA) is beneficial to them,  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday. The TPP negotiations, which started back in 2008, are led by the United States and involves 11 other Pacific Rim nations: Singapore, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Vietnam. Although talks are deep into the final stretch, there is growing concern that the megadeal covering nearly 800 million people and a combined gross domestic product of US$27.7 trillion could still stall because of domestic politics in the US. Speaking during a dialogue at the opening of the inaugural Singapore Forum, Mr Lee noted the urgency to reach a deal, especially with the US gearing up for presidential elections next . \"It not the sort of time when people are very focused on subjects other than the elections, and the (election) campaign has already begun,\" he told an audience of about 250 people, including many diplomats, policymakers and business leaders, at the Shangrila Hotel. \"But I hope that, in the midst of these preoccupations, there will be time to put in a good word for AsiaPacific, for free trade, and for the TPP,\" he . Analysts say that the TPP success is likely to hinge on whether the US Congress can pass the trade promotion authority legislation, which allows US lawmakers to set objectives for trade deals in exchange for a yesorno vote. Mr Lee noted that while US Trade Representative Michael Froman had the full backing of President Barack Obama on the TPP, the talks could run into trouble unless congressmen and senators were fully sold on the merits of the deal. \"Having spent 45  of intense effort, that would be a great pity, and not just from an economic point of view,\"  Mr Lee. \"The TPP is about linking the two sides of the Pacific closer together, stitching them together, and giving substance to the idea of the US being a Pacific power.\" As the audience peppered the prime minister with questions during the lively 40minute session, one diplomat asked for his views on the future of the relationship between Europe and Southeast Asia. Mr Lee, whose last visit to Europe was in February when he spent a week in Germany and Spain,  he hoped the economic links between the two regions would grow. He noted that Europe was preoccupied with a very large domestic agenda, with many of its economies having various difficulties or issues to sort out. One plus, however, is that many European companies have a global reach and are wellknown in Asia. \"Singapore is small, but Asia is a big and vibrant market. The European companies have to be here,\"  Mr Lee, adding that they were welcome to invest in Asia. \"Be it Siemens, Bosch, Santander or Shell, European companies are global names, and you can\\'t be a global name unless you are fully engaged in this part of the world,\" he . In his opening remarks earlier, the prime minister  that Asia was on the uptrend in terms of economic development and growth. The continued prosperity of the region, however, would depend on three noneconomic factors nationalism, territorial disputes, and security and how countries deal with each of them. On nationalism, he stressed that while it is a positive force, it could also be a possible reason for conflict between countries. \"You\\'re not arguing over resources, but over historical issues, which are very difficult to resolve and to come to a single consensus upon,\" he . \"It the response to globalisation uncertainty the stresses and strains of trying to improve your life in a very uncertain world and these similar stresses and strains affect us, and I think that one of the reasons why you see that in Asian countries too. That one factor we have to watch carefully.\" The Singapore Forum is organised by the S Rajaratnam Endowment, a nonprofit philanthropic organisation set up to honour Singapore first foreign minister, and continues on Saturday with a fullday conference.

       " 'REPORTS TOUT VALUE OF GLOBAL TRADE DEALS Herald News The battle over whether President Obama will get authority to quickly make trade agreements, in particular deals that cover the Far East and Europe, turned to focus on the impact of trade on New Jersey and other states Thursday. A statebystate report, titled \"The United States of Trade\" and released by the U.S. Department of Commerce,  166,000 New Jersey jobs were supported by exports last , when the state exported goods worth $36.8 billion. The report release, and that of a related economic brief, \"Jobs Supported by State Exports 2014,\" were part of a White House effort to step up pressure on Congress to grant the president authority to make deals, known as \"fast track\" or \"trade promotion authority.\" While Republican congressional leaders say they are willing to support the measure depending on the final plan, unions and some liberal Democrats have fiercely opposed the effort, contending it will enable trade deals costing American jobs and forcing down wages. Federal officials  a vote on a bill giving the president the authority meaning Congress could approve or reject a trade deal but not amend it could come as early as next week. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., DPaterson,  he opposed a similar bill in 2002, believing it gave too much authority to President George W. Bush, and he may do so now. \"Before I could support a new fasttrack approval process, I must know that the underlying agreement is a fair trade deal for the American worker,\" he . If given the authority, Obama wants to strike two trade agreements, the TransPacific Partnership, with Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with European Union countries. U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, in a telephone news conference Thursday, touted the benefits of trade to states, including creating jobs, investment and sales. \"This new report demonstrates how trade continues to create goodpaying jobs across the country,\" Pritzker . \"These numbers make it clear that in today global economy American prosperity and job creation are directly tied to our ability to reach new markets and new customers beyond our borders.\" The reports says that New Jersey in 2014 was ranked 13th in the nation in jobs supported by exports. Texas, with 1.1 million exportsupported jobs, was top ranked, and New York was fourth, with 390,000 jobs. However, New Jersey position has worsened in recent , the economic brief released Thursday shows. The number of state jobs supported by exports peaked in 2011 at 177,158, and has since fallen by 6.5 percent. The state in 2014 had fewer exportsupported jobs than in 2010, according to the report. Pascrell  he is concerned the TransPacific Partnership contained dispute settlement procedures that could undermine key labor, environmental and consumer protections. In December, he voiced similar concerns about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Charles Wowkanech, head of the New Jersey branch of the AFLCIO,  the fasttrack authority would limit debate on the merits of trade agreements that could hurt workers. \"We need trade deals that are fair rather than flawed,\" he wrote in an Op Ed piece in The Record in February. The national branch of the AFLCIO has vigorously opposed the bill, and says it has organized 400 events in recent months involving thousands of workers. The organization, in a March letter to congressional representatives signed by 60 unions,  fasttrack deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1994, are \"written largely by and for the world largest corporations [that] don\\'t create jobs: their main purpose isn\\'t even related to trade, it to enshrine rules that make it easier for firms to invest offshore and increase corporate influence over the global economy.\" Froman, in a release,  the reports made public Thursday show that small businesses will get a boost from trade agreements. \"American small businesses ... will benefit from tearing down trade barriers in markets around the globe, this is where we see a lot of opportunity for growth and more trade supported jobs,\" he . \"With the TransPacific Partnership we have a onceinageneration chance to unleash the economic potential of American small businesses and to level the playing field for our workers,\" he .',\n",
       " 'FREE TRADE; Rage Against the Economy Handelsblatt Global Edition Many are taking to the streets to protest the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. The amount of debate over the agreement is normal, but the widespread doubts over free markets are not, writes Handelsblatt coeditor in chief. Freedom is a big word: People n for it. The term \"trade\" also has positive connotations. Goods are exchanged, parties reach agreements and a winwin situation is the rule. So how could it have happened that \"free trade\" is becoming a negative term for millions of Germans, a symbol of the mass protests against \"those at the top,\" against the elites in politics and business? All of this is happening in a country that has gained prosperity and respect – and sometimes the envy of others – partly through exports, that is, with as much free trade as possible. Or, as British economist David Ricardo, the great thinker of free trade, put it almost 200  ago with his examples for cloth and wine, with as much benefit as possible from the international division of labor. The antifree trade mood is only one of many mysteries in an increasingly complicated situation, one in which the clunky acronym TTIP has made its way into the daily vocabulary of Germans, who now easily identify it as the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Four letters are suddenly at the top of everyone agenda. Four letters that represent the biggest social conflict of the day, a rebellion of the masses against the power of the few who have dared to take an  and giant undertaking. Four letters that stand for a government project of the highest quality, for secret negotiations between the European Union and the United States, and for an agreement that would provide 820 million people with nothing less than an economic bridge across the Atlantic, and create new entrepreneurial spirit and booming business. \"A culture struggle over the sort of life we want to lead has taken shape, largely unnoticed by the ministers, managers and makers in their welltempered headquarters.\" But this is precisely what makes people suspicious, and precisely what raises the question of power. Us or them? Money or mindset? Markets or morals? The dollar or the euro? Private or public sector? Free trade or subjugation? These are the kinds of contrasts that are at issue. A culture struggle over the sort of life we want to lead has taken shape, largely unnoticed by the ministers, managers and makers in their welltempered headquarters. Some are preaching new growth, which will create jobs in an embattled world of products and sees China as a champion and India and other emerging markets as future stars. Others reject this as the master plan of mammon, even as evidence of a pervasive \"economism,\" for the alleged domination of life by the business world – preferably by multinationals that create their own laws and whose managers and shareholders are filling their own pockets. Allegedly. And there is also a little antiAmericanism mixed in, a little \"Yankee Go Home\" sentiment. The TTIP battle is – as unbelievable as it may seem – as big in Germany as the former controversy over nuclear power, the military buildup or the 1987 census. Since mid2013, representatives of the European Union and the United States have attended negotiations in Brussels, Washington and other locations, always accompanied by lobbyists and eyed by antilobbyists, and public opinion of the negotiations has worsened by the month. At first, a clear majority of Germans favored a new major international treaty, one that would revive trade between the Old Continent and the New World, but now only 39 percent support the agreement. And when the next round of TTIP negotiations begins at the end of the month, public approval could drop to as low as 37 or 36 percent. And where will it be by the end of 2015? Where will it be when the talks are expected to be over, so as not to conflict with the American presidential election campaign and German Chancellor Angela Merkel reelection two  later – all \"German Angst\" aside. Something is getting out of hand in Germany. A project in the market economy that is in fact logical and praiseworthy is becoming a proxy war between civil society and \"corporate capitalism,\" between government and nongovernment, between the street and the salon – with the term \"street,\" in the digital age, meaning the hundreds of thousands of people who use Facebook and Twitter to organize their protest activities, while the others, the representatives of the grand plan, buy advertising, issue press releases and give interviews. Some have their official timetable, their topdown delights, their fact sheets of mediated reason. They predict that trade between the European Union and the United States, currently worth about half a trillion euros, will increase, and that the roughly $1 billion in tariffs paid by German automakers will be eliminated. Others have their emotions, their resistance and their doubts – and are often armed with better questions, because so much remains unresolved. In almost two , the individuals involved in hammering out TTIP have failed to successfully communicate their  project. Their figures have occasionally been suspect, sometimes they have avoided questions and at times they have sought to justify the project by claiming that it represents the interests of the state. In a media society, this sort of thing inevitably leads to disaster. The most positive example, one that proponents have repeatedly praised, was that TTIP would make it possible to standardize rear car blinkers, which are red in the United States and orange in Europe. The more urgently governments warn against a failure of transAtlantic free trade, the more they appear to lose their power over public opinion of the trade agreement, that is, the power of interpretation. All of a sudden, things are no longer what they are but what they appear to be. And the new countervailing power is suddenly more appealing to many people than the official power, even if Chancellor Merkel praised TTIP two  ago as a project for the future and now, with some annoyance, is calling for faster results. Or when German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel predicts: \"Our children will curse us if we get this thing wrong.\" He should be more concerned about the curses of his fellow leftwing politicians, whom he aims to convert to supporters of free trade at a small convention of his centerleft Social Democrats in June. The countervailing power bears the friendly face of a native of the Bavarian, Thilo Bode, who likes North Africa and did his docterate on a foreign trade topic at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, who once ran Greenpeace Germany and has been the head of Foodwatch for the past 13 . Mr. Bode and his team have their offices in part of a former textile factory in Berlin Mitte district. He has filled a niche in the market with his bestseller \"Die Freihandelslüge\" (The Free Trade Lie). Mr. Bode understands that every solution needs a problem, and because the TTIP problem is getting bigger by the day, he and Foodwatch are planning their attack in France, a key European country. His organization has teamed up with several others, including Attac, Campact and German Watch. Their mission is to \"stop TTIP,\" and it also the heart of a campaign. \"Experience has shown that the United States has often understood harmonization as adaptation to U.S. standards.\"– Stefan Heidbreder, Managing Director of the Foundation for Family Business Mr. Bode forced the Federation of German Industries, or BDI, to recently revise its optimistic predictions on how TTIP could affect growth. The free trade agreement, he argued, would only lead to a 0.05 percent annual increase in growth, and eventually perhaps 400,000 new jobs in the E.U. These figures were calculated by an institute in London and the Institute for Economic Research in Munich. But econometric models are not an effective means of obtaining the truth about free trade. There is no way to tell whether trade will be diverted, that is, whether companies will no longer send their orders to China but the promised TTIP land instead, as some strategists for the People Republic fear. The term \"freetrade lie\" or, alternatively, \"freetrade trap,\" is catchier. The best thing now is to dispense with numbers altogether, because this is all \"abstract and far away,\"  Michael Hüther, director of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. The shared values of the West are the most  thing, he , as evidenced by TTIP. Mr. Hüther points to the 1980s, the preeuro period, when there were also no valid prognoses on the expected effects on affluence. The difference is that thenChancellor Helmut Kohl was a strong and decisive leader. Mr. Kohl had behaved \"like a dictator\" and knew that he would have lost a referendum on the euro, he later confessed. Representative democracy can only be successful, he added, if someone stands there and says: \"This is the way it works.\" The Merkel administration will submit TTIP to the lower house of German parliament, the Bundestag, unless the whole thing collapses. And although it is a \"mixed treaty,\" Berlin should still support it. AntiTTIP activists are unconvinced by the economic view that freetrade zones are emerging all over the world and that this is why the Europeans could perhaps use a strong partner. Their arguments are often tinged with basic ideological principles. Franz Kotteder, author of \"The Big Sellout,\" sees the negotiators\\' efforts as nothing less than a plot, even an \"economic coup d\\'état.\" The attempt by the delegations representing U.S. President Barack Obama and the European Commission to reduce bureaucratic hurdles through TTIP, harmonize standards and eliminate tariffs altogether is creating a major stir. Although some critics wouldn\\'t call it a \"coup,\" many fear TTIP could lead to special rights for corporations, which could sue for billions in private arbitration courts. They suspect that Americans could stand in the way of tougher European laws relating to consumer, employee and environmental protection by arguing that U.S. corporations could suffer losses as a result. Mistrust is the prevailing sentiment, mistrust over a partnership that should in fact be based on mutual trust. German small and midsized companies, which could sell their products more cheaply in the United States thanks to TTIP, will have to remain patient for longer than expected. \"We are leaving all controversial issues for the time being and postponing them until later,\"  Arndt Kirchhoff, chief executive of an automotive supplier by the same name that serves the U.S. market. Otherwise, he added, the United States will do business with China first and then Europe. It annoys Mr. Kirchhoff to have to do everything twice for the U.S. market, and he notes that his company expends a fifth of its capacity on designing the same machine twice. Lawmakers should establish the rules of free trade, while industry should attend to the details,  Luitwin Mallmannthe, president of the North RhineWestphalia Association of the Metal and Electronics Industry. But not everything is sunny in the corporate camp. It is  to prevent abuses with arbitration courts,  Stefan Heidbreder, managing director of the Foundation for Family Business. He argues that they should only be permitted for direct investments in the real economy, but not for financial transactions. The trade agreement, Mr. Heidbreder , could be  to family businesses in the hightech market, but he also warned: \"Experience has shown that the United States has often understood harmonization as adaptation to U.S. standards.\" Mr. Heidbreder hopes that the E.U. negotiators will recognize this problem and proceed with maximum transparency. \"The secretiveness at the beginning of the negotiations caused serious damage and cost a great deal of trust,\" he . \"We are all part of the economy, including those in the antiTTIP camp.\" That is now the consensus. Some mistakes have minimized the opportunities. It was the time when E.U. Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht defiantly responded to protesters who had proudly presented 470,000 signatures by saying: \"And I speak for 500 million.\" His successor, Cecilia Malmström, has been striving to achieve transparency, even if such negotiations must, of course, be confidential. She occasionally posts TTIP documents online and has published a brochure describing the 10 biggest myths about the agreement. But after the many days of arrogance, perhaps this more accommodating approach is too late. The strategists in Brussels have stubbornly refused to accept the 130 protest groups from 21 countries as a European citizens\\' initiative. No matter how the dispute over TTIP ends, the debates over details, chicken treated with chlorine and perks for carmakers, are not alarming. This is normal for such propositions and is part of democracy. What is alarming is the large grassroots opposition to business in general, apparently fed by the failure of banks in 2008, which pulled the entire system into the biggest crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s and, for the most part, had to be bailed out by the government. This has taken away the halo. Merely the desire to turn a profit has become suspect. There are neoliberals everywhere. But we are all part of the economy, including those in the antiTTIP camp. Corporate capitalism? Companies have employees who support families and consume goods and services. They have suppliers who will do better in a tarifffree world. They have customers who value price reductions and want innovations, stimulated by demand from abroad. And companies pay taxes (unless they\\'re called Google or Apple), which the government can use to build universities and roads, or to support the weaker members of society. TTIP – a project that helps the economy and others as well. We could simply try it out, with the option of withdrawing from the agreement in a few . The rest is politics. Gross domestic product is more the result of courage than of fear. \"We should not tire of emphasizing the advantages of TTIP,\"  Airbus CEO Tom Enders.',\n",
       " 'No Rise in Smuggling When Cigarette Branding Is Removed All Africa Research conducted in Sydney and recently presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Thoracic Society for Australia and New Zealand found no increase in the proportion of illegal cigarettes since 2012 when Australia became the first country to introduce plain packaging on all tobacco products. Australia move to plain packaging mandated that branding be removed from tobacco packaging and be replaced by uniform packaging that displayed brand names in a standardised form. This new packaging also bore large, graphic picture warnings covering most of the pack. \"There have been repeated claims that the introduction of cigarette plain packaging leads to contraband, illegal cigarettes flooding the local market,\"  lead researcher Macquarie University professor Matthew Peters in a statement. \"What is clear from our survey is that there has been no increase in illegal tobacco use in Sydney.\" \"Governments overseas have no reason to fear a flood of illicit sales as they progress (to) plain packaging legislation,\"  Peters. According to National Council Against Smoking Executive Director Dr Yussuf Salooyee, the findings counter many of the tobacco industry arguments opposing the introduction of similar legislation in South Africa. \"These findings debunk tobacco industry propaganda which claims that plain packaging will increase smuggling,\" Salooyee told Healthe News. Industry has opposed similar moves at home Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi announcement to introduce similar regulation in this country was met with opposition from the tobacco industry, which warned that the move would increase the trade in illegal cigarettes. The Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa (TISA) expressed concern about Motsoaledi suggestion to introduce plain packaging. TISA argued that Austrailia move to plain packaging had not reduced the rate of smoking in the country but had led to an \"alarming\" increase in illicit trade in the country. \"There is a risk that plain packaging legislation will create further advantages and opportunities for illegal traders,\" TISA CEO Mr Francois van der Merwe, . \"Plain packaging legislation will destroy the trademark and make it impossible for consumers to differentiate between legal and counterfeited tobacco products.\" However, the Australian Department of Health has reported a steady decline in smoking following the introduction of plain packaging. Salooyee  that TISA arguments were to be expected. \"A standard industry response to any new measure designed to reduce tobacco use is to falsely claim that smuggling will increase,\" Salooyee . \"The industry expects the customs authority fears of increased crime to override health concerns and defeat the measure,\" he added. \"This study shows that when governments stand up for health, the industry claims will be exposed as nothing more than fear mongering.\"',\n",

       " 'German economy minister plays down boost from EUU.S. trade deal: magazine Reuters News Germany economy minister warned on Saturday against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from a trade deal between the United States and European Union but  the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers. The European Commission is trying to finalize a deal on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which some experts say could generate $100 billion a  in additional economic output on both sides of the Atlantic. It would eliminate all tariff barriers between the United States and EU members, which together account for almost half the global economy. \"I don\\'t believe in the wondrous calculations for economic growth from (the trade deal) TTIP,\"  Sigmar Gabriel, also chairman of Germany Social Democrats (SPD) which shares power with Chancellor Angela Merkel conservatives. \"All the estimates about its impact ... give an impression of voodoo economics,\" Gabriel told Focus weekly. However, Gabriel, who has long expressed reservations about some aspects of TTIP,  Europe urgently needed a deal. \"Our companies would profit because, with equal standards, they wouldn\\'t have to go through approval procedures twice.\" \"Overall, Europe would profit because we could influence the standards for world trade for the coming 20 or 30 ,\" he , adding without a deal, other countries, including China, would end up setting environmental and consumer standards. Gabriel repeated the SPD concerns about allowing U.S. mulitnationals to use socalled investortostate dispute settlement mechanisms to challenge Europe food, labor and environment laws on the grounds that they restrict free trade. The United States will not accept a deal without that. Asked by Focus when TTIP could be finalised, Gabriel  the view in Brussels was that hopes a deal could be concluded this  were very ambitious.',\n",
       " 'Trade deal has health consequences The QuadCity Times Speaking recently at an economic forum, Richard Trumka, the outspoken president of the AFLCIO, asked this about free trade: \"Is our trade policy working for America workers and for our nation as a whole? And the simple answer to that question right now is no, it isn\\'t.\" Trumka was addressing the controversial TransPacific Partnership that the Obama administration is attempting to fasttrack through Congress. But our trade policy isn\\'t working for other nations, either. Writing last week in The Guardian, Ramon Vera Herrera blamed free trade for the obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic ravaging Mexico, Central and South America. \"Today, many countries in the global South are seeing an explosion of these afflictions all because their governments welcomed in transnational food companies looking for new \\'growth markets\\' for poor quality, heavily processed or just plain junk food,\" wrote Vera Herrera. \"For big conglomerates to increase their profits, they need to develop and sell products aimed at hundreds of millions of the world poor. ... To reach these potential consumers, large food corporations are infiltrating, inundating and taking over traditional food distribution channels around the world, and replacing local foods with junk, often with the direct support of local governments.\" Vera Herrera  that the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Clinton in 1993, destabilized Mexico food system in terms of loss of economic stability, the undercutting of local food producers\\' profits and, in many cases, the gobbling up of land by huge agricultural companies. These are major reasons for Latin Americans\\' skyrocketing incidences of malnutrition, obesity and associated diseases, he says. Recall this irony: In 2013, Mexico became the fattest nation on earth, taking the title from the United States, which had reigned supreme for . Today, both countries are neck and neck for the dubious title. Mexico obesity epidemic should be no surprise to anyone who has traveled south of the border in the past few . Where once sidewalks were packed with vendors selling freshly cut fruit and vegetables, freshly squeezed juices and handmade comestibles, vendors are now likelier to be hawking bottled soft drinks, American candy bars and colorful packets of salty, fried chips. When I visited family in Mexico in the 1980s, it was rare to see American stores, restaurants or products. My mom used to pack Snickers bars and Oreos to treat the family kids since those items were generally unavailable there. But on my last trip to Mexico City, in 2007, I was shocked to see that my aunt formerly sleepy neighborhood had been transformed into a miniAmerican suburbia with a Burger King, two Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises, several WalMarts teeming with Nabisco and FritoLay packaged goods and even a Hooters chicken wing restaurant. So many Mexican citizens drink sugary sodas that the country status as the world top consumer of soft drinks led to a tax on the beverages in order to help curb the rapid expansion of obesityrelated disease. Less publicized, however, are communities who rely on bottled soft drinks as their No. 1 alternative to water because their governments have not prioritized providing clean, running water for their citizens\\' use. This is not to say that malnutrition in Mexico and other Latin American nations can be blamed solely on free trade agreements. But many experts point to such deals as force multipliers in poor countries where an influx of cheap calories can quickly become a very expensive national health crisis. Vera Herrera writes: \"After visiting the country in 2012, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food got it right when he : \\'The overweight and obesity emergency that Mexico is facing could have been avoided, or largely mitigated, if the health concerns linked to shifting diets had been integrated into the design of the country trade policies.\\'\" It begs the question about how such dietary concerns are being addressed, if at all, in regard to the 12 countries involved in the proposed TransPacific Partnership. Vietnam, for instance, is currently juggling both hunger and rising obesity, while Singapore is struggling to stem obesity and Malaysia is already Asia most obese country. But with the text of the proposed trade agreement shrouded in secrecy, we may not find out whether nutrition was even a consideration until it much too late.',\n",

       " 'Andy Warhol as a Guide to Trade New York Times I OFTEN ask people in my business public policy where they get their inspiration. Liberals often point to John F. Kennedy. Conservatives usually cite Ronald Reagan. Personally, I prefer the artist Andy Warhol, who famously declared, \"I like boring things.\" He was referring to art, of course. But the sentiment provides solid public policy guidance as well. Warhol work exalted the everyday \"boring\" items that display the transcendental beauty of life itself. The canonical example is his famous paintings of Campbell Soup cans. Some people sneered, but those willing to look closely could see what he was doing. It is the same idea expressed in an old Zen saying, often attributed to the eighthcentury Chinese Buddhist philosopher Layman Pang: \"How wondrously supernatural and miraculous! I draw water and I carry wood!\" Warhol critical insight is usually lost on most of the world. This is not because people are stupid, but because our brains are wired to filter out the mundane and focus on the novel. This turns out to be an  survival adaptation. To discern a predator, you must filter out the constant rustling of leaves and notice the strange snap of a twig. Warhol believed that defeating this cognitive bias led to greater appreciation of beauty. It also leads to better public policy, especially in relieving poverty. For example, while our attention is naturally drawn to the latest fascinating and expensive innovations in tropical public health, many experts insist it is cheap, boring mosquito bed nets that best protect against malaria. Despite their lifesaving utility, these boring nets tend to be chronically underprovided. We can look closer to home, too. People love to find ways to get fancy technology into poor schoolchildren hands, but arguably the best way to help children falling behind in school is simply to devise ways to get them to show up. But the very best example of the Warhol principle in policy is international trade. If it is progress against poverty that we\\'re pursuing, trade beats the pants off every fancy development program ever devised. The simple mundane beauty of making things and exchanging them freely is the best antipoverty achievement in history. For more than two decades, the global poverty rate has been decreasing by roughly 1 percent a . To put this in perspective, that comes to about 70 million people equivalent to the whole population of Turkey or Thailand climbing out of poverty annually. Add it up, and around a billion people have escaped destitution since 1990. Why? It isn\\'t the United Nations or foreign aid. It is, in the words of the publication YaleGlobal Online, \"High growth spillovers originating from large open emerging economies that utilize crossborder supply chains.\" For readers who don\\'t have tenure, that means free trade in poor countries. That mug in your hand that says \"Made in China\" is part of the reason that 680 million Chinese have been pulled out of absolute poverty since the 1980s. No giant collaboration among transnational technocrats or lending initiatives did that. It was because of economic reforms in China, of people making stuff, putting it on boats, and sending it to be sold in America to you. Critics of free trade often argue that open economies lead to exploitation or environmental degradation. These are serious issues, but protectionism is never the answer. Curbing trade benefits entrenched domestic interests and works against the world poor. And what of claims that trade increases global income inequality? They are false. Economists at the World Bank and at LIS (formerly known as the Luxembourg Income Study Center) have shown that, for the world as a whole, income inequality has fallen [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/upshot/incomeinequalityisnotrisinggloballyitsfalling.html?_r=1&abt=0002&abg=0] for most of the past 20 . This is chiefly because of rising incomes from globalization in the developing world. Interestingly, Warhol himself once remarked on the democratizing effect of global commerce with his characteristic ironic edge. \"The President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too,\" Warhol . Fortunately, President Obama appreciates the benefits of trade and is currently fighting for the latest international trade pact, the TransPacific Partnership [https://ustr.gov/tpp] (T.P.P.). It would knock down barriers between North American, South American and East Asian nations, benefiting rich and poor people and countries alike. Admirably, the president is standing up to critics in his own party (as well as some in the opposition) who oppose the deal. With luck, T.P.P. will make its way through the House and Senate this spring or summer, and receive the president signature. Trade doesn\\'t solve every problem, of course. The world needs democracy, security and many other expressions of American values and leadership as well. But in a policy world crowded with outlandish, wasteful boondoggles, free trade is just the kind of beautifully boring Warholian strategy we need. Americans dedicated to helping others ought to support it without compromise or apology.',\n",
       " 'WTO review of Pakistan trade regime Daily The Pak Banker Karachi: Pakistan major trading partners who reviewed the trade policies and practices pursued by the country since 2008 concluded in a WTO meeting in Geneva last week that Pakistan expanding economy needs more fiscal consolidation, infrastructure expansion and trade liberalisation. The country regulatory framework and development initiatives also came under strong scrutiny. The participants put over 200 questions over what they considered hurdles in the way of freer and larger trade volumes. Most active in the discourse were representatives from the US, China, EU, Malaysia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Argentina and Japan. Some members raised the issue of the presumptive income tax of 1pc on export proceeds. They believed that exporters pay lesser income tax as compared to nonexport companies, and a member termed this difference a subsidy Ahead of the review, the WTO secretariat had prepared a comprehensive research document on Pakistan trade regime. Pakistan had responded through a position paper to the WTO secretariat, highlighting the government efforts to improve the economy and foreign trade. These two documents became the basis for the five review. Trade policymaking in Pakistan has been a \\'ritualistic\\' process. It is focused on demands for cash subsidy on exports or a ban on imports or tariff increases to ward off international competition. There is no overall strategy, and, at best, the trade policy tends to adjust competing interests and often ends up promoting interests of certain groups at the cost of others. This approach was brought into the spotlight by the queries at the review meeting. The frequent use of adhoc trade policy instruments, mostly SROs tax and traderelated special regulatory orders came under discussion. These adhoc trade policy instruments, it was stated, have undermined the predictability of the trade regime. For example, the government has imposed 10pc regulatory duty on the import of nonessential and luxury goods. Regulatory duties on the export of raw hides and skins and molasses etc are being levied to cater to the local valueadded domestic industries\\' demand for raw materials. Recently, the government imposed regulatory duty on the import of sugar and wheat as well. The EU wants these duties to be withdrawn. Most of the countries wanted Pakistan to lift its ban on the import of poultry and poultry and livestock products from negligiblerisk countries. The WTO members appreciated Pakistan commitment to phase out the remaining tax concessions and exemptions by the end of June 2017. Some members also raised concerns over the high degree of protection afforded to the domestic automobile industry. While encouraging the rationalisation of tariffs, they appreciated the move to end the SRO culture. While welcoming a small reduction in the applied MFN tariff since 2008, several members voiced concerns with respect to the big difference between applied and bound rates. Similar reservations were also expressed about the abolition of dutyfree tariff lines. A number of members raised the issue of what they considered to be a high degree of overall tariff protection, which favours importsubstitution. Subsidies in various forms were also questioned. These included subsidies for promoting exports and applying markup rates for export finance schemes to promote certain products. Certain members reiterated the need to reduce subsidies and export prohibitions. Other issues that were raised included the support price for wheat, pricing in the pharmaceutical industry, importlicensing procedures, safeguard mechanisms and the high number of antidumping investigations. The lack of notifications, particularly those pertaining to agriculture and domestic support, was also mentioned. Contrary to these observations, a senior Pakistani official who was a part of the review  everyone had appreciated and encouraged the elimination of SROs. \"We generally got a good response; the members appreciated our trade and economic performance.\" He added that, by and large, the response was very positive. \"They told us to improve our cost of doing business ranking, and encouraged Pakistan to sign government procurement agreements and information technology agreements,\" the official . The proposed establishment of the Exim Bank was also highlighted during the review. The bank is likely become operational by the end of this calendar . The imports and exports of all sectors, including agriculture, will be eligible for financing by the Exim Bank. The issue of the presumptive income tax of 1pc on export proceeds was also raised by some members. They believed that exporters pay lesser income tax as compared to nonexport companies. A member termed this huge difference in income tax a subsidy. Other issues raised during the review included transparency in procurement rules, effective enforcement of standards, complete capital account liberalisation, effective supervising authorities for ensuring coordination and compliance and progressive liberalisation in trade and services. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevdo, in his concluding remarks on Pakistan trade regime,  he would like to underline that despite the many challenges faced by the country, its economy had proved to be resilient and several of its policies since the last review demonstrated its commitment to moving towards more transparency and predictability. \"I am encouraged by the progress Pakistan continues to make in its pursuit of a more prosperous future. Pakistan has a vast array of natural resources, a strategic geographical position and a large, willing and young labour force,\" he . \"The challenge for Pakistan is to harness this potential through appropriate policies and reforms, including improving the business climate; further liberalising the trade regime and ensuring its predictability; reducing state intervention in the economy; providing adequate infrastructure facilities, especially those related to the power sector; and improving the fiscal situation by broadening the tax base,\" he concluded.',\n",
       " 'Multilateral Trade Negotiations Doha to Bali and Beyond Policy Perspectives Fasih Uddin Institute of Policy Studies [abstractThe latest round of multilateral trade negotiation under the World Trade Organization (WTO) known as the Doha Development Agenda has remained inconclusive for well over 13 . There have been serious differences between the developed and developing countries on issues such as market access and agricultural subsidies. While a compromise deal was reached in the Bali ministerial conference of the WTO making the round a success remains an uphill task as divergences are there and apparently reaching a consensus is hard. However it will be in the interest of all the member nations and the global economy to take the round towards a successful conclusion. ] Introduction Notwithstanding shortterm and cyclical ups and downs\\' in the last sixty  the world output and trade expanded steadily. During 1950 and 2013 global output in real terms rose by annual average of over three per cent while merchandise trade in US dollars surged three hundredtimes. This growth was facilitated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that was concluded in September 1947 and succeeded by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 1994. In addition to setting basic principles and framework for the conduct and expansion of global trade these agreements envisaged periodic multilateral negotiations for further liberalization of trade and removal of barriers. So far eight rounds of negotiations have been successfully conducted. The ongoing ninth round named Doha Development Agenda\" was launched by the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha (Qatar) in November 2001; encompassing wide range of areas and to be concluded by December 2004. The Talks encountered serious obstacles from the beginning; 13  have passed differences on critical issues among member persist and final conclusion is not yet in sight. Realizing the obstacles in making all round progress the last Ministerial Conference in Bali (Indonesia) in December 2013 picked up some areas (called Bali Package) on which consensus could be reached earlier than completion of Talks. This paper reviews the progress of negotiations in the past 13  analyses the Bali Package in the context of the Doha Agenda and discusses the prospects and challenges lying ahead. It also looks at the issues from Pakistan perspective. European Union project independent of global socioeconomic and political factors will stand no less an incomplete analysis.Doha Development Agenda The 21st Century began in difficult conditions. The world economy was under recessionary pressure; attempts to launch the next multilateral trade negotiations at the third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in September 1999 had failed; and 9/11 incidence had shattered the world confidence. The fourth Ministerial Conference (November 2001) was thus held under gloomy atmosphere; yet it surprisingly took a bold decision to launch the next round of negotiations named as the Doha Development Agenda\\' to be concluded by December 2004. It covered wide range of areas (21) including trade in agricultural and nonagricultural products services intellectual property rights trade and environment trade facilitation dispute settlement special and differential treatment to developing countries and aid for trade. The negotiations were to be conducted by a newly created Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) supported by sector committees and groups. The negotiations failed to conclude by the deadline of December 2004 and still remain inconclusive. These postDoha 13  passed through phases of conflict divergence confrontation and stalemate; occasionally interspersed with a ray of hope. The spirit in which the Doha Agenda was launched did not last long; the negotiations repeatedly collapsed leaving the original deadline of December 2004 far behind. Though final conclusion is not yet in sight some positive developments in the shape of Bali Package took place at ninth Ministerial Conference in Bali in November 2013. The journey from Doha to Bali passed through following stages. Hitting the rough road early (November 2001 September 2003): The postDoha work began with establishing the negotiating setup; identifying and clarifying issues; and outlining modalities of negotiations. Initial discussions in the Trade Negotiations Committee and special sessions of Agriculture and Services Committees brought to the fore divergence of views among members on some crucial matters. The most sensitive issues were: (a) Agriculture: Divergence of views mainly between developed (in particular European Union and United States) and developingcountries on (i) Market Access (ii) Export Subsidies and (iii) Domestic Support Measures. (b) Nonagriculture Products: Failure to agree on modalities and formula for further reduction in trade barriers. (c) Services: Lack of progress on further liberalization and commitments. (d) Other Areas: Progress in other areas was also slow and was affected by stalemate in negotiations in above areas. The unresolved issues at committeelevel in Geneva were supposed to be resolved at the fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun (Mexico) in September 2003. Instead of finding solutions the Cancun Conference exacerbated the confrontation and derailed the negotiation process. The advanced countries (in particular the USA and European Union) maintained their position of opposing the elimination of export subsidies and reduction in domestic support measures on agriculture while the developing countries pressed for their reduction and elimination in return for greater access in nonagricultural products to their markets. The conflict heightened; the meeting ended in confusion with the Director General WTO and the Chairperson of the Conference making short statements indicating failure of the Conference. It was a great setback with no such precedence in GATT/WTO history. Efforts to bring back the Talks on track (July 2004 December 2005): The failure at Cancun was followed by intensive informal contacts among members in particular the main actors in the conflict. These discussions facilitated the General Council in July 2004 to adopt some  measures for bringing negotiations back on track. These included: Preparation of framework agreements for negotiation on agriculture nonagriculture products and services; Reiteration of the needs of developing and least developed countries with respect to special and differential treatment technical assistance capacity building food security and rural development; and Special safeguard mechanism for developing countries. These decisions were placed before the fifth Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. Initially the situation remained tense as conflicts reemerged. However at the last moment the Conference was able to approve these measures and agreed on the timeframe ofApril/July 2006 for finalization of negotiation modalities. It also resolved to eliminate export subsidies on agricultural products by 2013 and arrived at understanding to complete Doha negotiations by end of 2006. Suspension of Talks (July 2006 December 2011): The target of April/July agreed for finalization of negotiation modalities remained elusive; conflicts reemerged and the situation became so tense that negotiations had to be suspended to save it from complete collapse. Once again the members relied on informal consultations in which the main players were more active. These consultations continued without any break through; the parties did not budge from their earlier positions. Owing to sensitivity of the issues the eighth Ministerial Conference held in December 2011 in Geneva confined its deliberations to regular work of WTO; only holding general discussion on the Round and issuing Political Guidelines\\' reaffirming members\\' commitment to the Talks. While acknowledging that the Doha Talks were at an impasse the Conference decided to advancing negotiations in areas where progress could be achieved. This meant focusing on elements of Doha Agenda that would allow members to reach agreement based on consensus earlier than full conclusion of Talks; thus enabling the Trade Negotiation Committee to prepare groundwork for identifying and fostering negotiations on such elements. Intensive negotiations enabled the General Council in July 2013 to approve a package of elements focusing on development. Partial Retrieval of Talks (December 2011 November 2013): The ninth Ministerial Conference held in Bali (Indonesia) in December 2013 welcomed the advances in the Doha Agenda at the last General Council meeting and adopted a Package (known as Bali Package) consisting of some elements of Doha Agenda on which consensus was reached. These included: Trade Facilitation Conclusion of negotiations on Agreement on Trade Facilitation and setting up the Preparatory Committee to ensure expeditious entry into force of this Agreement. Agriculture a) General Services: With a view to promoting rural development and poverty alleviation the Conference agreed that the General Services programs related to land reforms and rural livelihood security could be considered as falling within the scope of nonexhaustive list of General Services of Agreement on Agriculture. b) Public Stockholding for Food Security: The Conference agreed on an interim mechanism on public stockholding for food security purposes till a final mechanism was agreed. c) Tariff Rate Quota: The Conference adopted an understanding on tariff rate quota administration of agricultural products. d) Export Competition: While regretting that it had not been possible to achieve the objective of reducing export subsidies on agricultural products by 2013 as envisaged by Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration the members agreed to exercise utmost restraint with regard to any recourse to all forms of export subsidies and all export measures of equivalent effect. Cotton: While regretting that trade related component on cotton of Hong Kong Conference Declaration (2005) was yet to be delivered the Conference reiterated the importance of pursuing progress in this area. Development and LDC Issues: The Conference adopted certain improvement measures in following matters: a) Preferential Rules of Origin for LeastDeveloped Countries; b) Preferential Treatment to Services of LeastDeveloped Countries; c) Dutyfree and Quotafree Market Access for LeastDeveloped Countries; and d) Monitoring Mechanism on Special and Differential Treatment. PostBali Work: While reaffirming commitment to the development objectives of Doha Declaration the Conference instructed the Trade Negotiations Committee to prepare within next 12 months a clearly welldefined work program on the remaining Doha Development Agenda issues. Steps for Revival of Talks (November 2013December 2014): The decisions of the Bali Conference were pursued at informal as well as General Council and committee levels during 2014. Progress was stalled in July as India suggested that deadline for Trade Facilitation Agreement be postponed to December 2014 and that the decision relating to public stockholding for food security purposes be amended to address its concerns relating to support to traditional food crops. The US objected to India suggestion which led to deadlock in Talks; which was ultimately resolved through bilateral IndiaUS agreement in November2014 and the US agreed to the India position on public stockholding. The November 2014 meeting of the General Council amended the Conference decision accordingly paving the way to advance the work further; in particular in respect of: Trade Facilitation Agreement: Setting up of the Preparatory Committee on Trade Facilitation and adoption of the Protocol amending WTO Agreement 1994 annexing the  Agreement. The Agreement will come in force on ratification by twothird members.Public Stockholding for Food Security: The Bali decision was modified to the effect that until a permanent solution is agreed Members shall not challenge compliance of a developing Member with its obligation to support provided for traditional staple food.PostBali Work: Extending the deadline for preparation of work program on Doha Agenda to July 31 2015. Doha Development Agenda Pakistan Perspective Being one of the 23 founder members of GATT Pakistan has been an active participant in GATT/WTO work. It has been an ardent supporter of the principles of multilateral trade system and special and preferential treatment to developing countries. The role of Pakistan in the negotiation of the Textile and Clothing Agreement under Uruguay Round (198694) was widely appreciated. The Agreement led to abolition of quota restrictions by developed countries on import of textile and clothing and brought back their trade under WTO regular fold. Pakistan is continuing with its positive stance in the Doha Round individually as well as in association with other groups (e.g. Cairn Group G33 G20) keeping its national interest in view. The objective is to improve market access for its agricultural and manufactured products and services; ensure special and preferential treatment to developing countries; and support rulebased trading system. Specific areas of its interest are: Agriculture: Elimination of export subsidies and reduction of domestic support measures in particular in the US European Union and other highly protected markets to ensure greater market access for its products; as also Special Safeguard Mechanism for products of developing countries. NonAgriculture Market Access: Elimination of tariff peaks tariff escalation and nontariff barriers on products of its export interest (like textiles clothing and leather goods) in other markets. Services Trade: Liberalized commitment in mode 4 (Movement of Natural Persons) as it has export potential in manpower. Special and Differential Treatment to Developing Countries: Improvement in rules and more effective application of concessions relating to such treatment to developing countries. It may be pointed out here that as a participant in the Talks Pakistan is required to open up its market and assume additional obligations. In order to fully exploit the trade potential envisaged in the Doha Agenda Pakistan needs to resist domestic protectionist pressure realign its economic and commercial policies to principles of multilateralism and take measures to improve its global competitiveness. The effective implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement will improve competitiveness by reducing cost and time involved in processing cross border trade transactions. Evaluation This section addresses three issues; namely the impact of impasse on trade development and trading system; factors contributing to impasse; and prospects of successful conclusion of the Talks. Effect of Impasse on Growth and Trading System The impasse in negotiations on Doha Agenda has adversely affected trade and development and has led to rise in trade restraining measures by members. a) During 1948 and 2013 the world trade had expanded by over 300 times in terms of US dollars and world GDP (in real terms) grew by 3.4 percent per annum (for details see Annex). This growth was partly attributable to the successive Rounds of Multilateral Trade Negotiations conducted under GATT/WTO since 1948 which had reduced barriers to trade and provided a congenial trading environment. The Doha Agenda was expected to improve this growth process further. According to a World Bank Study the liberalization of merchandise trade and elimination of subsidies under Doha Agenda could add 1.5 trillion dollars to developing country incomes. Reshaping the world trading system and reducing barriers to trade in goods could reduce the number of poor by 300 million by 2015 and boost global income by as much as US $2.8 trillion over the next decade (i.e. by 2011). Thus trade and economic development have suffered due to impasse in Talks; the main beneficiaries namely the developing countries suffered the most. b) The deadlock in Talks has encouraged actions that are detrimental to the promotion of multilateral trading system. According to the recently published WTO report on International Trading Environment (December 2014) : Regional and bilateral arrangements have flourished. By mid2014 over 250 arrangements were reported to WTO Secretariat while another 63 also exist. Trade restrictive and distortive measures taken by members have increased. During 2008 and mid2014 about 2150 such measures were taken as against 510 removed. The compliance of WTO obligations and requirements by members has slowed down. Factors Responsible for Lack of Progress Many factors including the following are responsible for the impasse in Talks. Unlike earlier Talks the Doha Round included some sensitive issues like agriculture which are deeply imbedded in domestic policies and politics of member states. For instance export subsidy on agricultural products by the European Union and domestic support measures to agriculture by the United States are key elements of domestic politics and policy and their elimination is being resisted. They are main stumbling blocks in the Talk. The statesmanship required on their part to take bold decisions by resisting the political pressure for the good of global trade and development is missing. The newly emerging economies (including China India Brazil South Africa etc.) are required to open up their market and provide greater market access in return for concessions to be extended by others. These countries are not very forthcoming in opening their markets. Decisions in WTO are generally taken on the basis of consensus. Building consensus among 160 big and small countries with varied interests is a difficult and time consuming task. The adoption of the results of the Talk is to be a single undertaking\\' which implies that the balancing of concessions and commitments will be based on conclusion of negotiations in all areas. This means that even if agreement is reached in some areas these will remain open till negotiations on other areas are concluded. This slowed down the overall progress also. In many areas negotiations were to be preceded by time consuming process of exchanging information and agreeing on definition and identification of issues and negotiating modalities. PostDoha was a volatile period for the world economy (the financial turmoil Euro crisis and slowing down of growth) which distracted the attention of leading members from undertaking meaningful negotiations on Doha Agenda. Prospects of Successful Conclusion of Talks The thirteentuck Talks saw a ray of hope in Bali (December 2013) and the Bali Package was hailed as an  stepping stone towards the completion of the Doha Round. In this context two questions need to be addressed: (a) Does the Bali Package contain such elements as would help in resolving the key issues of Doha Agenda and (b) Taking into account the trackrecord is it realistic to believe that the deadline set for preparing work program will be adhered to a) The Bali Package covers a few areas; and they are not of high significance in the context of overall Doha Agenda. The only  development is the conclusion of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. In agriculture the decisions relating to general services food security and tariff rate quota are of marginal value. The LDC matters basically relate to clarifications and laying down procedures. On cotton there is reaffirmation of commitment made in Hong Kong Ministerial Conference (December 2005) with no concrete measures now being suggested. The decision on export competition is in fact going back on the commitment made by developed countries at Hong Kong to eliminate export subsidies by 2013; that too without setting a new deadline. b) The Bali Ministerial Conference had instructed the Trade Negotiations Committee to prepare within the next 12 months (i.e. December 2014) a clearly welldefined work program on the remaining Doha Agenda. This deadline has since been extended to July 2015 by the General Council in November 2014. Thus the possibility of further extension of the deadline cannot be ruled out. Conclusion The past efforts to salvage the Doha Talks failed with adverse consequences for global trade development and multilateral trading system. Will the Bali Package help in reviving the Talks is an open question with serious caveats. The controversial issues (mainly; market access export subsidy and domestic support measures in agriculture; greater nonagriculture market access; and new commitments onservices trade) are critical and the positions taken on them by key actors are inflexible. In particular their position in respect of agriculture is dictated by domestic policies and lobby groups. There are no indications that these actors are ready to soften their stance. The European Union seems to prefer taking the Hong Kong Conference/July 2004 General Council decisions as the starting point for developing future work program and seek balancing of gains of Talks on overall basis as well as in each area. The USA is reported to suggest fresh approaches reluctance to offer concessions on their domestic support measures and seeking greater services and nonagriculture market access in newly emerging economies (China India Brazil etc.). The emerging economiesare for protecting their agriculture support programs (such as food subsidy) and hesitant to open their market of nonagriculture products . The interest of developing countries continues to be on getting effective differential and more favorable treatment in obtaining as well as offering market access. Thus despite Bali decisions to bring back the negotiations on track the task is difficult. So far the progress is slow. Beside serious efforts to iron out the differences at the negotiation table basic changes on domestic front are required for agreeing on the work program by the new deadline of July 2015 and concluding the Talks as early as possible. The first half of 2015 is crucial and all formal and informal avenues should be explored to arrive at consensual decisions. The stakes are high and any further delay could damage the multilateral trading system with serious consequences for world trade and development.',\n",
       " 'WTO members set to accept new trade facilitation agreement 13 April 2015 Manila Bulletin Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are set to formally accept the new Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), with many affirming their hope of seeing the agreement enter into force by the WTO 10th Ministerial Conference in Nairobi next December. At a recent meeting of the WTO Preparatory Committee on Trade Facilitation (PCTF), representatives from more than a dozen delegations  the domestic ratification process for the TFA was already underway, with some delegations outlining target dates for securing approval. Ambassador Esteban Conejos of the Philippines, the chairperson of the PCTF, told members he understood a considerable number of additional WTO members have started the ratification process. The challenge, he , is that the process is domestic in nature and differs from country to country. However, a number of developing country members highlighted the domestic legislative hurdles that will need to be overcome to secure acceptance. Several indicated they were not in a position to ensure ratification by the Nairobi meeting, which will take place on December 1518. To date, four WTO members Hong Kong (China), Singapore, the United States and Mauritius have secured domestic acceptance of the TFA, which was concluded at the WTO 2013 Bali Ministerial Conference. Twothirds of the WTO 160 members will need to ratify the TFA in order for the agreement to enter into force.',\n",
       " 'India can become a global trading power if it takes megaregional negotiations seriously April 13, 2015, 6:24 am ISTHYPERLINK \"http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/author/economictimes/\"Economic Times in HYPERLINK \"http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/etcommentary/\"ET Commentary |HYPERLINK \"http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/business/economy/\"Economy, HYPERLINK \"http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/india/\"India|ET By Vijay Kelkar & Harsha V Singh India’s international trade has contributed in a major way to its growth, evident in its ratio of tradetoGDP rising from 26% in 2000 to 53% in 2013. The country should now have a strong presence in initiatives to formulate global governance of international trade. That is yet to happen. Historically, strong trade powers have emphasised designing rules for conducting trade and, more recently, investment. The rules determine the advantages and opportunities from links with the global economy. Today, such initiatives are being taken by the large trading nations through socalled ‘megaregional negotiations’. India is not a part of most of them. India needs to be one of the countries that define the conditions for world markets and investment opportunities. To evolve its strategy, India has to consider eight key factors: 1. An increasingly significant part of world trade takes place through global value chains. Countries tend to produce only a part of the final product, with several nations involved in the production of any one item. 2. This has given rise to a rising overlap between trade, investment and global value chains. More and more, policies for any one of them will have to take account of the other two. So, the scope and impact of trade policies is now much wider than conventionally understood. 3. The WTO negotiations are not moving ahead and the largest economies have begun to emphasise negotiating new conditions for trade and investment through megaregionals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). India is part of the RCEP, but the likely RCEP standards will be lower than others, and the TPP and the TTIP will effectively determine the global conditions for conducting trade and investment. Interestingly, India’s foreign trade policy announced on April 1 recognises that megaregionals will cause “greater burden of compliance on India’s manufacturing and services standards for access to the markets of participating countries”. There are wondrous markets out there. 4. China, which is part of RCEP, has begun to take an interest in the membership of the other megaregionals. Notably, eight of the 16 RCEP economies are part of the other initiatives. Thus, the TPP and the TTIP will be the dominant framework of trade rules that will be applied in over twothirds of global trade. 5. The TPP, the TTIP and the TISA will result in a significant market opening among members, leading to trade diversion and loss of markets for nonmembers (including India). 6. Much of trade in western markets is now conducted under private standards — standards emphasised by the lead firms in value chains. The megaregionals will increase the impact of private standards and will determine the conditions for participating in much of international trade. 7. These private standards emphasise environmental and labour standards. A major effort is required to broadbase these standards in India. 8. Over 100 WTO members are outside these megaregionals. For sustaining stable trade relations, they need to be part of the future system of global governance of trade. That means energising the WTO system and bringing the attention of large economies back to it. India should — by itself, or together with China — make a proposal for negotiations opening up goods and services markets among all developed economies, and those developing countries that are among the top 20 economies of the world, with the possibility of others to join in. One of the aims would be an eventual elimination of tariffs on manufactures over the agreed target periods. The products that are subject to negotiation could cover all tariff lines not already bound at zero and all services product categories, beginning with negotiating market opening for threefourths of these products for developed economies and half of these products for developing economies. And, the products not covered in the initial opening up would be part of a negative list. Even in the TPP, negotiations envisage a long transition period. This could be 10  for developed economies and 20 for developing economies. This would provide adequate time for countries conducting their own reform and their efforts at improving global competitiveness. Once the agreement on such a list is reached, every five  after implementation, negotiations can take place for opening up a part of the negative list, say, onefourth of it. Three other considerations could be added. One, that if a nation has a prominent position in global exports of some product, that product should automatically be transferred from the negative list to the positive one. Two, if any nation has a problem with market opening for some product, a longer period for phasein may be provided for that product through consultations. Three, discussions could begin on how to facilitate the participation of nonmembers in the trade regimes being developed through megaregionals to enable their eventual multilateralisation. This initiative will bring the attention back to WTO, an inclusive system catering to different levels of development. It will also show India as a country with an inclusive approach, emphasising conflictfree global trade and investment conditions.

       " 'Doha talks critically  for developing countries: UN From Shreerupa Mitra Jha Geneva, Apr 13 (PTI) Underlining the \"critical importance\" of the successful completion of the Doha Round of talks, the UN today  \"multilateral solution\" to outstanding issues at the WTO remain extremely  for agriculture dependent countries like India. Speaking at the sixth Global Commodities Forum here, the Secretary General of UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Mukhisa Kituyi , \"For commoditydependent countries, particularly agricultural commodities, a successful completion of the agriculture agenda of the Doha Round is critically .\" \"Yet as we all know the dynamics of multilateral trade rules making has slowed down and that slowness has been reinforced by the growing popularity of pluritaleral negotiations whether Trans Atlantic or Trans Pacific,\" he . \"While not taking away anything from the mega plurilaterals, I think for commodity dependent developing countries, multilateral solution to outstanding questions of agricultural negotiations remains extremely ,\" he added.

Its aim is to lower trade barriers around the world, and thus facilitate increased global trade. Agricultural subsidies is one of main contentions between developing countries led by India and Brazil and the developed countries including the EU and the US. The stalled talks received a major boost late last  following a landmark agreement on food subsidies between India and the US, after India had blocked the trade facilitation agreement (TFA) at the WTO in July.',\n",
       " 'Discourse: RI voices development concerns in Doha talks Linda Yulisman, The Jakarta Post, 14 April 2015 The Jakarta Post The historic trade reform deal of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Bali in December 2013 restored confidence on multilateral trade systems and acted as a stepping stone to continue talks on the Doha Development Agenda, which had stalled for more than a decade. The Jakarta Post Linda Yulisman discussed the progress of the implementation of the Bali Package, which covers trade facilitation, agricultural issues and provisions for least developed countries (LDCs), as well as ongoing developments in the world trade governing body, to prepare for the next ministerial meeting scheduled for later this  in Nairobi, Kenya, with Indonesian Ambassador to the WTO Iman Pambagyo. Here are excerpts of the interview. Question: How is the progress of implementation of the trade facilitation deal and where does Indonesia stand now? Answer: WTO members agreed in November last  on a protocol to implement the Trade Facilitation Agreement and now most of them are preparing their domestic rules for its adoption. A few countries like the US, Hong Kong and Singapore have already ratified and put it into effect. Indonesia still has to ratify it in a government regulation as stipulated in our new Trade Law [passed in 2014]. On agricultural issues, how far have the talks gone to formulate a permanent solution for domestic support as agreed in Bali? We\\'re still working on it in parallel with discussing the postBali work programs. Our target is to make a permanent solution for the domestic support issue one of the deliverables at the Nairobi conference. We don\\'t want the current measure the socalled \"peace clause\" [the exemption for any developing economy that breaks the WTO 10 percent subsidy limit from being challenged by other members] to apply forever because we want the public food stock provision by governments to benefit other developing countries outside those that had already launched subsidy programs for their farmers before the Bali meeting. We have met for dedicated sessions to discuss the permanent solution and we heard some more specific objections from developed nations, and Indonesia as the leader of the G33 Group [an alliance of developing countries with large populations of smallholder farmers] will further bring those issues to the members and think of what we must do next: revise or add parameters to address their concerns, etc. What will be on the table for postBali work programs? There are quite a lot of issues, such as agriculture, nonagriculture market access and services. But, it is  to note that these issues are part of the Doha Development Agenda and contain interests of developing countries that we aim to defend. Talks about developing countries and development agendas can\\'t be separated from agriculture. That why the level of ambition in postBali work programs is determined by the level of ambition in agricultural issues domestic support, export competition and market access. The G33 Group interests are concerned with market access which, apart from tariff reductions, also affects special products to be excluded from tariff reduction or elimination and a special safeguard mechanism that allows us to quickly and easily impose additional duties to offset an influx of imports. What message has Indonesia been trying to voice and how does it play a role to help move all these negotiations? What we have been trying to voice is that development interests must be accommodated in whole issues, including nonagricultural market access, services and agriculture because once again, this is a development agenda. For developed nations, the level of ambition is measured by the achievement of commercially meaningful outcomes. But, for developing countries like Indonesia, the credibility of these entire discussions [on postBali programs] is determined by how much the development issues can be accommodated. We don\\'t want to rush for a conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda in Nairobi as some countries have expected. It because we always only want to complete the agenda when it credible. It the sole chance for developing countries to have their development needs accommodated. The agenda also addresses difficulties faced by developing nations in their specific situations and, at the same time, fixes imbalances in existing agreements that, for instance, have allowed developed countries to provide continuous agriculture subsidies for their farmers and adjust them to a level that reflects the current situation. Once the Doha Development Agenda is finished, or otherwise remains stagnant, members will move forward with other issues, such as environment, the extension of information technology agreements and ecommerce, in the multilateral discussions, and these are not specific issues for developing countries. So that why we really have a strong interest in finishing the Doha round in a credible way. We\\'re trying to voice the interests of our [country] and other developing countries in various formats, including informal breakfast meetings of 15 developing and developed countries such as China, India, Brazil, the US, European Union and Japan and informal consultations with the Committee on Agriculture. As we chair the G33 Group, we certainly focus on endorsing proposals on public food holding, special products and special safeguard mechanisms. On the domestic subsidy issue, we\\'ve always maintained our position that we are not a strong demander, but we have a great interest in seeing that tradedistorting support is reduced and disciplined both for developing and developed nations, which will also apply for us.',\n",
       " 'Participants in Services Negotiations Begin Preparations for July Stocktaking Meeting By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, April 14, 2015 April 13 — Participants in the plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) this week will review their progress in the negotiations with the goal of defining key dealbreakers ahead of a stocktaking exercise planned for July. Representatives for the 24 trading partners will spend much of the April 1317 round considering ways to liberalize trade in a handful of TiSA 17 annexes, according to a European Union statement. Specifically, TiSA participants will focus on new disciplines for service industries, including financial services, telecommunications, domestic regulation, maritime transport and temporary crossborder movement of professionals. Negotiators have concluded 11 rounds of talks, with the most recent round in February focused on the continued evaluation of participants’ existing proposals. Members will discuss pending requests from countries seeking to join the talks, including Mauritius. If accepted into the negotiations, Mauritius would become the first African nation to participate, marking a “step towards making TiSA a fully multilateral agreement,” the EU  in the statement. U.S. Opposes Including China U.S. trade officials continue to oppose China bid to join the talks because they remain skeptical that China could sufficiently open up its services marketplace to meet the level sought in talks. Though many TiSA participants, including the EU, have sought to include China, the U.S. has been vexed by various Chinese policies regarding information and communications technologies. The U.S. has criticized China failure to permit foreign competition in its electronic payment marketplace following a 2012 WTO dispute settlement decision that required China to do so. The U.S. recently queried China about domestic technology procurement requirements for its commercial banking sector that it  runs counter to China WTO obligations. Such outstanding matters must be addressed by China before TiSA participants can have a serious discussion about Chinese participation,  one TiSA observer. The negotiations were launched in 2012 to update the WTO 1995 General Agreement on Trade in Services with rules to address modern services disciplines. The 17 services sectors under consideration include: telecommunications, ecommerce, data localization, financial services, maritime transport, land transport, air transport, professional services, workforce localization, performance requirements, energy services, environmental services, domestic regulations and the temporary crossborder entry of business professionals, among others. The participants, which collectively represent 70 percent of the world $44 trillion services marketplace, are: Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the EU, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the U.S. and Uruguay.',\n",
       " 'Hiked demand for highvalue exports to benefit developing countries WTO 14 April 2015 Manila Bulletin Increased demand for highvalue products and rising prices in the global food markets would create opportunities for developing countries to achieve economic growth through expanding and diversifying their agricultural exports. A study by the World Trade Organization (WTO) noted that highvalue exports in Southeast Asia increased from $5.2 billion in 1980 to $57.2 billion in 2010, coinciding with increasing standards and increased consolidation at the buyer end of the value chains. The WTO noted that highvalue agricultural exports entail an  potential for raising rural incomes and reducing poverty due to high intrinsic value and laborintensive production systems. Many developing countries have recognized that the development of highvalue food export sectors, particularly horticultural exports, is an  strategy to foster propoor growth. The study  that a large number of developing countries have been able to diversify their agricultural exports and to expand their exports of highvalue products, most ly fresh fruits and vegetables. However, the study raised concerns about the increased use of standards that may imply nontariff barriers for global trade. \"In combination with the dominance of large multinational food companies and food retailers in the sector may cause entry in international agricultural markets to be more difficult for developing countries,\" it . The study paper also noted that private standards in particular may create barriers to trade by increasing the costs to trade.

       " 'India Threatens to File Complaints to the EU and WTO on Behalf of a CRO By Ed Silverman 13 April 2015 Dow Jones Institutional News The India government is reportedly looking to push back against the European Medicines Agency for suspending the sale of hundreds of drugs that were authorized for use based on studies conducted by a large clinical research organization based in India. The India Ministry of Commerce is considering \"commercial and legal\" action against the European Union if the EMA does not rethink its decision, according to The Hindu Business Line. The EMA suspension went into effect in January after French regulators raised concerns about the reliability of studies conducted by GVK Biosciences between 2008 and 2014 on behalf of various large drug makers. At issue were alleged anomalies found in the way that electrocardiograms were monitored for the trials. This was raised during an inspection last May by French regulators, which prompted several European countries and later the EMA to suspend approval of medicines that were tested by GVK. The EMA noted, however, there was no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness with any of the drugs. \"We have met the European Medicines Agency... and given them evidence to show the tests by GVK Biosciences were not manipulated,\" Rajeev Kher, the India Commerce Secretary, tells The Hindu Business Line. He added that if there is no response soon, the government may file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. \"The European agencies have suspected the clinical trials on grounds that are absolutely flimsy,\" he continued. \"Not just GVK, but the companies for which the clinical trials were done, which include several multinationals, have given a plethora of evidence to show that there was no manipulation... We have asked EMA and some other European agencies to cross check the ECGs and get back to us.\" We asked the EMA for a response and will update you accordingly. A spokeswoman for GVK, meanwhile, writes us that the CRO has provided India commerce ministry with ammunition in the form of independent audit reports, as well as a report from the Drug Controller General of India, to support its contention that its studies were conducted properly. The spat arises at a time when the India pharmaceutical industry is being closely scrutinized by overseas regulators. As we have noted previously, the FDA has repeatedly issued warning letters to India generic drug makers and, in some cases, issued bans that prevent products from being shipped to the U.S. Last month, for instance, a socalled import alert was issued against Aarti Drugs. The ongoing infractions have prompted questions about the ability of the India government to oversee quality control and the subsequent integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Although the India government has taken steps to bolster its own oversight, the FDA crackdown has also spawned resentment. \"The past few  have seen a lot of action where the fault was not seen in the substance of the medicines, but in the processes,\" Kher told the paper. \"We feel that this approach needs to be tempered.\"',\n",

The four countries\\' ambassadors to the EU on April 1 sent a letter to the commission, a copy of which was obtained by Inside U.S. Trade, that echoes points made by agrifood industry groups on both sides of the Atlantic in two similar letters sent to the commission in the preceding weeks. Industry representatives had actively urged the governments to weigh in on the matter, sources . This wave of lobbying comes ahead of a highly anticipated report expected to be released later this month by the commission, which will summarize its sixmonth review of the EU approval procedures for imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and make recommendations for how they could be reformed. Among these is a proposal to give individual EU member states the authority to ban imports of GMO food and feed products they do not want to allow into their markets, sources have . This proposal is expected to largely mirror an approach the commission endorsed with regard to authorizations for cultivation of GMO crops. But in a sign that the EU could face significant pushback internationally over this idea, the four ambassadors in their letter gave a clear signal that they would be wary of any approach that would further limit trade or erect new market barriers within the European Union. \"[W]e are closely following the Commission review of the authorization process for genetically organisms for food, feed and imports. We have some serious concerns on the potential outcome of such a revision,\" the ambassadors wrote. \"We trust that the Commission will ensure that any options under consideration are fully consistent with the EU [World Trade Organization] obligations, including the commitments to base measures on scientific principles and to ensure that the measures are not more trade restrictive than necessary to achieve the EU legitimate objectives,\" they added. They appeared to be referring to Article 2.2 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures, and Article 2.2. of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Those provisions generally state, respectively, that any SPS measure must be \"based on scientific principles\" and that technical regulations shall not be \"more traderestrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks nonfulfillment would create.\" The letter was signed by U.S Ambassador Anthony Gardner, Canadian Ambassador David Plunkett, Argentinian Ambassador Hernan Lorenzino, and Brazilian Ambassador Vera Barrouin Machado. The letter was addressed to Commission President JeanClaude Juncker and the entire college of commissioners. One industry source  this week  the commission proposal would entail a legislative amendment to the current EU regulation governing approvals of genetically modified food and feed products Regulation 1829/2003. It would allow member states to prohibit the use of EUauthorized products, but only on grounds not associated with the European Food Safety Authority risk assessment of the GMO in question. Member states would have to submit the proposed restrictions to the European Commission, this source , although it was not clear whether the commission envisions having the authority to sign off on or reject the measures. Any such legislative amendment would have to be voted on by the European Parliament and member states. The four ambassadors were also outspoken in saying that any proposed changes should be discussed with all relevant stakeholders and trading partners \"at an early stage, in order to have the opportunity to provide you with additional inputs to be considered before any new rules are adopted.\" They also urged the commission to quickly authorize the import of 17 pending GMO traits for corn, soy and cotton, and two genetically modified flower varieties. They  authorizations should continue under the existing system \"in a timely manner\" pending any changes to the system. The ambassadors noted that the EU has not approved a biotechnology trait since November 2013 and  these delays \"put at risk the EU much needed imports of vegetable proteins for animal feed, the monthly value of which has been estimated by your industry at over 100 million euros.\"',\n",

Mexico banned imports of live U.S. cattle in 2003 due to worries over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called \"mad cow disease.\" U.S. pork shipments to Peru had been restricted by requirements intended to prevent the spread of trichinae, a parasite that causes trichinosis in humans. The USDA release  the change with Mexico will take effect immediately. Undersecretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Ed Avalos  in an interview with Inside U.S. Trade that the Mexico deal was struck on April 6, but that talks had been ongoing since 2008. Avalos  a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) determination in 2013 that the U.S. had a \"negligible risk\" for BSE assisted the U.S. in its negotiations. \"That gave us ammunition, if you will, with our counterparts in Mexico,\" he . Under the agreement, the live cattle shipments will be inspected by a veterinarian for Mexico secretariat of agriculture at the U.S.Mexico border and then placed under a seal until reaching a Mexican packing plant, where they are ultimately slaughtered. Avalos  this protocol was set up to avoid worries that the U.S. exports would not be diverted from the packaging plant to a ranch, or elsewhere. With Peru, Avalos  that the U.S. pork industry will use an existing program to provide certification for exporters that their shipments to Peru are free of the trichinae. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative National Trade Estimate (NTE) report listed Peruvian freezing and testing requirements for pork to be “unnecessary as U.S. producers maintain stringent biosecurity protocols that limit the incidence of trichinosis.\" According to the report, the U.S. had consistently raised the pork issue in bilateral dialogues since 2012, including as recently as January 2015. The NTE did not list the Mexico cattle issue as a trade irritant. Both Mexico and Peru are party to the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) talks. Avalos  the talks to resolve the animal health issues were held independent of TPP discussions. But a U.S. agriculture industry source noted that these types of deals could help shore up support for TPP and renewing Trade Promotion Authority, especially members of Congress from agricultural districts',\n",
       " 'US Takes Steps to End Entry Limit on India Fruit  14 April 2015 The Economic Times Bangalore Edition India mangoes, grapes, pomegranates and lychees may soon find their way to the US market after Washington agreed to send its inspectors to approve the country preshipment inspection process, moving a step closer to lifting entry restrictions on India fruit. This was decided at the first bilateral video conferencing on agriculture last week as part of the collaborative effort to resolve the outstanding trade issues, a government official .\"The US assured us that they will be sending their inspectors in the coming months to approve our preshipment clearance process as we sought access for our mangoes, pomegranates, and lychees. Grapes consignment is almost ready to take off,\" the offi cial . \"The matter is nearly sorted.\" The two governments had set up a trade policy forum in November last  for regular interaction, and New Delhi has been strongly taking up nontariff barriers imposed by Washington on India fresh farm products over sanitary and phytosanitary measures. India exported just $1 million, or about \\' . 6.2 crore, worth of fresh mangoes to the US in 201314, which was just 2% of the country overall mango exports of $50 million, or about \\' . 310 crore, during the . While India exported $279 million, or about \\'. 1,733 crore, worth of grapes that , only $30,000, or \\'. 18.6 lakh, worth of India grapes landed in the US. The issue relates to mango pesticide fumigation. India had suggested that the preclearance inspection be carried out by the National Plant Protection Orga nisation. Inspectors from the US will see if the scientific process followed to clear the consignments, the government official . \"We have an institutionalised mechanism for mango exports. The agreement between the US and India is about the process...consignments following the agreed process do not face problems,\" the official added. In the Plant Health Technical Bilateral Meeting last month in US, India provided the requisite information related to pestrisk analysis for grapes. India has put in place various schemes for registration of pack houses and processing units and fresh fruit and vegetables to ensure compliance with interna tional standards. The European Union in January lifted a ban on India mangoes imposed last  after 207 consignments were found contaminated with pests like fruit flies in 2013. The ban was lifted after European Commission team visited the country in September to inspect the packing houses and verify improvement in plant health controls and certification system with regard to fruits and vegetables. However, the ban on four veggies bitter gourd, eggplant snake gourd and taro stays for now. At the bilateral video conferencing, the US also raised issues their consignments face in India ports on account of the labelling norms. On organic products exports, the US wanted to hold discussion on the matter to allow traceability of the consignment to confirm if it was actually organic. India asked the US to give a larger quota to export tobacco products. \"We want to export more tobacco and they are good consumers of it. If other countries are not able to supply it, they should buy from India,\"  the official. India is the third largest producer of tobacco. The US imports 1.7 lakh tonnes of tobacco each . Most of it comes from nine countries; only 3,000 tonnes can be imported from the rest of the world as part of a tariff restricted quota system. In case favoured nations are unable to meet their commitment, imports from the rest of the world attracts a high duty of close to 350%.\"We asked the US to reduce the duty and give us a larger quota to export, but they  they will like to discuss it at WTO,\"  the official. Currently, India exports close to 1,000 tonnes of tobacco to US each .',\n",

       " 'CubaU.S. Relations Take Center Stage of Americas Summit in Panama By Lucien O. Chauvin WTO Reporter, April 14, 2015 April 12 — CubaU.S. relations dominated the Summit of the Americas that wrapped up April 11 in Panama City, while sideline discussions ensued about the prognosis for U.S. business investment in Cuba and improved trade relations in the region. Leaders also had side discussions about the status of the Pacific Alliance and the role of Latin and Central American countries in the trade facilitation agreement recently negotiated by the World Trade Organization and potentially in the TransPacific Partnership (TPP). Leaders of the 35 nations participating in the summit, the seventh organized since 1994, took turns during a long plenary session to congratulate Cuba and the U.S. for taking steps to normalize relations since the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Cuba in 1962. The facetoface meeting between Cuban President Raul Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama was the first between leaders of the two countries in 59 . Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos  on the sidelines of the summit that U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba has been like a “blister” on the foot of hemispheric relations. He  the region could now walk more smoothly toward greater cooperation and engagement. Santos hosted the previous summit in 2012 in Cartagena, Colombia. Latin American and Caribbean leaders at that meeting agreed that there would not be any additional summits if Cuba remained excluded. Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Lucretia Simpson Miller, whom President Obama met in Jamaica in a stop prior to attending the summit,  Cuba integration is a vital to the region. “I congratulate President Obama and the summit plenary.” Long Way to Go Castro and Obama were more cautionary during their sitdown meeting on the sidelines of the summit, saying the December announcement to restore diplomatic relations and subsequent measures announced in January were only the start of a long process. “Obviously there are still going to be deep and significant differences between our two governments. We will continue to try to lift up concerns around democracy and human rights. And as you heard from President Castro passionate speech this morning, they will lift up concerns about U.S. policy as well,”  Obama. Castro  he agreed with Obama assessment. He added that “we are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient—very patient. Some things we will agree on; others we will disagree.” Major issues remain to be addressed. Obama, as many observers had anticipated, did not announce Cuba removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba has been on the list for 23 . Obama  the U.S. State Department had concluded its review, but he had not made a decision. He told reporters, “I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be.” If the president does decide to remove Cuba from the list, there would be a 90day waiting period before anything happens. Republican leaders in Congress have called on the president to keep Cuba on the list. Misguided by Enthusiasm? The chatter about U.S. investment flooding into Cuba soon is misguided, at least one observer warned. The U.S. economic blockade of Cuba remains in place and would require congressional action to lift it. Cuban Trade and Foreign Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz told Bloomberg BNA on the sidelines of the summit that he hoped U.S. investment would be part of the $8.7 billion the country wants to attract in 246 projects. He  Cuba was improving its infrastructure and the Mariel Special Development Zone offered attractive conditions for investors. Richard Feinberg, a professor of international political economy at University of CaliforniaSan Diego and nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,  he did not expect to see U.S. investment in Cuba any time soon. “Let be really clear. U.S. companies are not allowed to invest in Cuba, period,” Feinberg . He  expectations that U.S. companies, including big hotel chains, would be jumping into Cuba “is a complete misunderstanding of U.S. economic policy.” Venezuela Fights Back Regional leaders called for the U.S. to review its March announcement of sanctions on several Venezuelan leaders for alleged human rights abuses. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  Venezuela is not a threat to the U.S. The Venezuelan government launched a media campaign in Panama pushing that theme. The strongest condemnation of the U.S. approach to Venezuela came from the other countries in the Venezuelanled Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) that includes 11 countries. Bolivian President Evo Morales  at a press conference April 11 that the U.S. was attempting to divide ALBA with a “carrot and stick” approach, warming up to Cuba while using “imperialist tactics” against Venezuela. Limited Trade Talk The regional summit process began in 1994 as an initiative to promote creation of the Free Trade Areas of the Americas (FTAA). A plethora of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements have been signed since then, but trade was conspicuously absent from the seventh summit in Panama. The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean lists 40 bilateral and multilateral trade agreements among countries in the region. The presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Peru met privately to discuss the Pacific Alliance. Chilean President Veronica Michelle Bachelet, the fourth member of that agreement, did not attend the summit. The alliance signed a trade pact last  freeing up trade on more than 90 percent of goods. The four leaders will meet in Cusco, Peru, in June to discuss further opening the pact and possibly decide on the incorporation of Costa Rica and Panama as full members. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez announced that the summit that his country also would like to join the alliance as a full member. Hernandez and Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina met on the sidelines of the summit to sign an according creating a customs union between their countries. The goal is full integration of customs by the end of this . Hernandez  it was the first customs union in the Americas and he was confident that other Central American nations would join once the union was fully operational. El Salvador president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, was on hand for the signing. Seven Central American countries are joined in the Central American Integration System (SICA). The Dominican Republic joined as a full member in 2013. A freetrade agreement with the U.S. (CAFTADR) was approved in 2005. Honduran President Hernandez brought up the TPP, saying his country wanted to join. The 12nation TPP includes Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the U.S. in the Americas. President Obama raised the trade issue in his final press briefing before leaving Panama on April 11. He  he was “encouraged by the support of many leaders here for the WTO trade facilitation agreement, which would boost regional trade, and for TPP with its high standards for trade and strong protection for workers and the environment.”',\n",
       " '16 Ecowas Countries Begin Uniform Tariff Regime for Imports by David Ogah 13 April 2015 All Africa Apr 13, 2015 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) SIXTEEN countries within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) may have started the implementation of uniform tariff on imports, beginning from yesterday. The tariff, set at 35 percent at most, will modify the rights and obligations of ECOWAS member countries under the Common External Tariff (CET) In Nigeria, government has directed immediate enforcement of the new tariff regime which put duty payable on imported items at 0 per cent for social and necessary items, 5 percent for raw materials, 10 per cent for intermediate goods, and 20 per cent for finished goods that are not produced locally. Nigeria was granted the possibility of adding a fifth band of 35 per cent for finished goods manufactured locally under the new dispensation that is expected to be reviewed in 2019. The directive to implement the regional tariff regime in Nigeria was conveyed to the Customs high command yesterday by the coordinating minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance, Dr Okonjo Iweala. The Customs spokesman, Wale Adeniyi,  yesterday that it was now mandatory for all stakeholders to fall in line with the new tariff regime, saying it would enhance trade facilitation within and outside the region. The implementation of the ECOWAS CET (20152019) together with its Supplementary Protection Measures (SPM) and 2015 Fiscal Policy Measures are being implemented concurrently and took effect from yesterday, after the expiration of the 30 days notice required under the provisions of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET). By this development, all imports arriving into the country shall be subjected to the rates contained in the CET 2015 2019 and 2015 Fiscal Measures without recourse to the rates applicable before the coming into effect of the ECOWAS CET 2015 2019. The approved Supplementary Protection Measures (SPM)/Fiscal Policy Measures an Import Adjustment Tax (IAT) list, which involves additional taxes on 177 Tariff Lines of the ECOWAS CET, a National List consisting of items whose Import duty rates have been reviewed to encourage more development in strategic sectors of the economy, an Import Prohibition List (Trade) and applicable only to certain goods originating from nonECOWAS Countries. This may create a contradiction between the World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments of individual countries and the requirements of the regional trade integration project essential for West Africa economic development. Following the adoption of the CET, Nigeria simple average tariff on agricultural imports dropped from about 32 per cent in 2000 to 15 per cent in 2010, while its tariff on manufactured products fell from 25 per cent in 2000 to 11 per cent in 2010.5 Nigeria accounts for more than half of the subregion imports. In nominal terms, its total imports increased from USD 6 billion in 1990 to USD 64 billion in 2011, while ECOWAS total imports rose from USD 14 billion in 1990 to USD 111 billion in 2011 according to United Nations Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In terms of import composition, Nigeria accounted for 40 per cent of ECOWAS agricultural imports in 2009 and 79 per cent in 2011, while its industrial imports represented 79 per cent and 65 per cent of those of ECOWAS in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Following the adoption of the CET, Nigeria simple average tariff on agricultural imports dropped from about 32 per cent in 2000 to 15 per cent in 2010, while its tariff on manufactured products fell from 25 per cent in 2000 to 11 per cent in 2010. Nigeria accounts for more than half of the subregion imports. In nominal terms, its total imports increased from USD 6 billion in 1990 to USD 64 billion in 2011, while ECOWAS total imports rose from USD 14 billion in 1990 to USD 111 billion in 2011 according to United Nations Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD) These data confirms the huge trade impact of Nigeria on the subregion and explains its late and reluctant acceptance of the ECOWAS CET. The CET is  to be incompatible with the individual commitments with WTO. WTO data clearly shows that the application of the ECOWAS common external tariff both for agriculture and industry would be a problem with regard to respecting the individual commitments undertaken by the group members at the multilateral level. All West African countries have lower applied agricultural tariffs than those they have bound at the WTO. Nigeria, for instance, has bound its tariff for agricultural products at 150 percent, while its applied tariff is only 33.6 percent The common external tariff is a mild form of economic union but may lead to further types of economic integration. In addition to having the same customs duties, the countries may have other common trade policies, such as having the same quotas, preferences or other nontariff trade regulations apply to all goods entering the area, regardless of which country, within the area, they are entering.',\n",
       " 'India tops in remittances, receives USD 70 billion From Lalit K Jha Washington, Apr 14 (PTI) The World Bank has  India continues to be the leading nation in remittances pulling in USD 70 billion from its global migrant workforce in 2014. World Bank study of remittance, the money workers and professionals working in foreign lands send back to their native countries, attributed this mainly to weak economic growth in Europe, deterioration of the Russian economy and the depreciation of the euro and ruble. Remittances to the developing world are expected to reach USD 440 billion in 2015, an increase of 0.9 per cent over the previous . Global remittances, including those to high income countries, are projected to grow by 0.4 per cent to USD 586 billion. United States, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) remained the top five migrant destination countries and apart from India, China, Philippines, Mexico and Nigeria are the top five remittance recipient countries, in terms of value of remittances, the report . \"Total remittances in 2014 reached USD 583 billion. This is more than double the ODA in the world. India received USD 70 billion, China USD 64 billion, the Philippines USD 28 billion. With new thinking these mega flows can be leveraged to finance development and infrastructure projects,\"  Kaushik Basu, World Bank Chief Economist and Senior Vice President. \"Israel and India have shown how macro liquidity crises can be managed by tapping into the wealth of diaspora communities. Mexican migrants have boosted the construction sector. Tajikistan manages to nearly double its consumption by using remittance money.

       " 'China will breathe fire if America tries to weaponise trade; OPINION By Michael Levi 14 April 2015 Financial Times Selling a freetrade agreement at home is hard work, given public scepticism about their effect on American jobs. So as supporters of the TransPacific Partnership try to round up backers, they increasingly emphasise the geopolitical case for concluding a deal. They are correct that a good trade and investment agreement would be geopolitically beneficial, and that a collapse in the talks would be deeply damaging. But too often they overstate the case and, in doing so, generate real geopolitical risks of their own, while also jeopardising the agreement they seek. The geopolitical case for TPP is straightforward. It could help US allies in Asia, most notably Japan , reform and thus strengthen their economies, making them more capable geopolitical partners. Asian participants could diversify their economic relationships, becoming less dependent on an unpredictable China . A deal that genuinely offers China the option of eventually joining could also help draw Beijing in a more liberal direction. Conversely, if the talks collapse because of domestic squabbling, it will compound the narrative of US dysfunction, making it far harder for the US to lead. It would also make it easier for China to push its own trade arrangements in ways that exclude the US. But selling the TPP by screaming \"geopolitics\" comes with serious risks. Unless the US is careful, China may come to see the deal as an attempt at economic containment. It is one thing to have a pact that reinforces America economic relations with friends and allies; one that encourages China to join after making a set of plausible economic reforms, much as it joined the World Trade Organisation. It is another to present the deal in a confrontational manner as a counterweight to China the economic counterpart to a military strategy that would seek to keep the country pinned in. Beijing, faced with such a prospect, may well conclude that their stake in sustaining an open, peaceful and rulesbased international economic order something from which they have benefited greatly is considerably less than they previously believed. Historically, leading powers faced with such a realisation have often sought economic security through special diplomatic or military arrangements instead, with disastrous consequences for international security. (Japanese aggression in the 1930s, while driven by a host of forces, was doubtless influenced by fears of being cut out of the global economic system.) Nor are US allies in Asia (not to mention Canada and Latin America) eager to be part of a bluntly confrontational approach to China. If America partners chafe at the unwelcome association, that will undermine Washington alliances in the region and the US geopolitical position. On top of that, the more the US tells its Asian partners that the TPP is about geopolitics, the greater the geopolitical damage will be if the deal fails. Talking up geopolitics too much also incurs risks at home. TPP advocates have turned to this tactic in part because of the difficulty of selling an agreement on its economic merits alone. But emphasising geopolitics could make some fencesitters more suspicious. During the cold war, the US often entered into lopsided trade agreements, deciding that helping allies\\' economies was more  than strengthening its own. Today Americans feel more vulnerable and less trusting of economic integration. Crafting a TPP that is justified on its own economic merits, with any geopolitical dividend a welcome bonus, is imperative. America public rhetoric, or at least its private diplomacy, needs to make clear that the TPP is not designed to cleave Asia. That will help ensure any agreement is a geopolitical success, and an economic one.

With economies around the world still struggling to fully recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and with conflicts flaring in places like Ukraine and the Middle East, global trade is expanding far more slowly than anticipated a  ago. The Ebola outbreak in west Africa, unusually harsh winter weather in the United States and collapsing world oil prices are also taking their toll, as are strong exchange rate fluctuations, Azevedo . \"All of these things have effects, sometimes destabilising effects,\" Azevedo . On Tuesday, WTO  preliminary estimates showed global trade had expanded just 2.8 percent last  and was expected to swell only 3.3 percent this . A  ago, the WTO was singing a different tune. Last April, it had forecast that trade would expand 4.6 percent in 2014 and 5.8 percent this . But it downgraded those predictions in September, to 3.1 percent and 4.0 percent respectively, before slashing them further on Tuesday. \"Trade growth has been disappointing in recent  due largely to prolonged sluggish growth in GDP following the financial crisis,\" Azevedo . \"Looking forward, we expect trade to continue its slow recovery, but with economic growth still fragile and continued geopolitical tensions, this trend could easily be undermined,\" he warned. Last  was the third consecutive  in which trade grew less than three percent, WTO  in a statement. In fact, trade growth averaged just 2.4 percent between 2012 and 2014 the slowest rate on record for a three period when trade was expanding. Trade growth is expected to pick up in 2016 with an expansion of 4.0 percent, it , warning though that going forward, trade growth looks set to remain well below the annual average of 5.1 percent seen since 1990. \"We are cautiously forecasting that trade will continue its slow recovery,\" Azevedo told reporters. WTO acknowledged though that \"risks to the trade forecasts are mostly on the downside.\" Trade is a key measure of the health of the global economy, which it both stimulates and reflects. But Azevedo warned Tuesday that a systemic shift might be under way and that trade expansion would no longer far outstrip overall economic growth as it has largely done for decades. \"The rough twotoone relationship that prevailed for many  between world trade growth and world GDP growth appears to have broken down,\" WTO . The organisation noted that \"the 2.8 percent rise in world trade in 2014 barely exceeded the increase in world GDP for the , and forecasts for trade growth in 2015 and 2016 only surpass expected output growth by a small margin.\" Azevedo  that the 2015 forecast was based on an assumption that global GDP would expand by nearly 3.0 percent, while the 2016 forecast depended on economic growth reaching over three percent. The International Monetary Fund announced later Tuesday that it expects to see global growth at a tepid 3.5 percent this , and 3.8 percent next . WTO meanwhile  developing countries were expected to see exports rise 3.6 percent this , while their imports were set to jump 3.7 percent. In developed countries, exports and imports were set to rise just 3.2 percent, it . Asia was expected to have the strongest export rise at five percent, followed by North America at 4.5 percent. The weakest export growth this  is predicted to come in South America with just 0.2 percent.',\n",
       " 'Global Growth Fails to Find New Momentum IMF predicts barest pickup amid troubles; cheaper oil prices fail to deliver expected jolt By Ian Talley 15 April 2015 The Wall Street Journal The world economic growth will barely accelerate this , the International Monetary Fund , because of troubles roiling major emerging markets and a feeble expansion in wealthier countries. Emerging markets are on course for their sixth straight  of slowing growth rates, led by a slowdown in China, a steep contraction in Russia and a recession in Brazil, the IMF  Tuesday in its economic forecast ahead of the fund semiannual meetings. The global economy should expand by 3.5% this , with sluggish recoveries in Europe and Japan and softer output in the U.S. as a stronger dollar weighs on exports, the IMF . That forecast is up just 0.1 percentage point from last  growth rate. Global growth is roughly on par with the average of the past three decades. But that isn\\'t enough to surmount the legacies of the 2008 financial crisis: stubbornly high jobless rates, hefty debt burdens and stagnating growth in several of the world largest economies. \"These legacies go away very slowly,\"  IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard. \"Deleveraging is a very slow process, and while it lasts, it really slows down growth.\" Together with aging workforces and deteriorating productivity levels around the world, the global economy faces a bleak, lowgrowth outlook through 2020, IMF economists predict. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde will urge the world finance officials meeting in Washington this week to use all available policy tools to jolt the global economy out of a nearly decadelong rut. Fund officials are pushing for more easymoney policies in Europe and Japan, despite the drag those policies can cause on U.S. and Chinese growth. Weakening the euro and yen to spur growth comes at the expense of a strengthening dollar and yuan. \"Accommodating monetary policies remains essential to support economic activity and lift inflation expectations,\" the fund . IMF economists estimate that the net, longterm effect of the currency depreciations will boost global gross domestic product by half a percentage point as the eurozone and Japan return to healthier levels. Amid the dollar surge, the IMF downgraded the U.S. forecast for the  to 3.1%, a 0.5percentagepoint drop from the fund last outlook in January. The fund estimates that the strong dollar could weigh on U.S. exports and growth for . Still, the fund  lower energy prices, tame inflation and an improving housing market will more than offset the drag on exports from a strong dollar. As the euro approaches parity with the dollar, the fund upgraded expectations for the eurozone to 1.5% growth, up from 1.2%. It also raised Japan forecast by nearly half a percentage point to 1%. The fund warned, however, that neither economy had escaped the risk of a much longer bout of stagnation. For the eurozone, Mr. Blanchard  the probability of recession has fallen substantially. \"What we saw as the major world macroeconomic risk, from a systemic point of view, is probably less likely to happen.\" The IMF also  the threat of global economic anemia outweighs building risks of asset bubbles and burgeoning threats to emerging markets from the surging dollar. The weak global growth outlook comes despite the growth jolt that falling oil prices should be giving major energy importers such as the U.S., Europe, China, India and Japan. But oil prices haven\\'t boosted growth as much as the IMF originally expected, in part because many countries are absorbing the potential passthrough to consumers by raising taxes or cutting fuel subsidies. As excess supply keeps a lid on energy costs, however, cheap oil could provide more support for economic growth later in the , the fund  In many economies, underlying weaknesses are coming to the fore. Brazil, for example, is expected to contract by 1% this  as the government struggles to overhaul its economy. China growth is expected to slow to 6.8% this  and 6.3% in 2016 below government targets as \"previous excesses in real estate, credit and investment continue to unwind,\" the IMF . India growth, though, suggests the rewards that governments can reap by encouraging investors with economic policies aimed at making the country more competitive. At 7.5% this , up from 6.3% in the fund last forecast, India expected growth rate would catapult it ahead of China as the fastestgrowing major emerging market.',\n",
       " 'WTO rules against U.S. dolphinsafe canned tuna labels By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) The World Trade Organization found on Tuesday that U.S. rules on dolphinsafe labels for canned tuna run counter to international trade laws, siding with Mexico in a longrunning dispute and opening the door to retaliation against U.S. exports. The ruling, which the United States  it would appeal, upholds Mexico complaint that revamped U.S. labeling rules are still discriminatory because they disqualify Mexican tuna from bearing dolphinsafe labels, unlike other countries\\' tuna. \"We recommend that the dispute settlement body request the United States bring its measure, which we have found to be inconsistent with (the WTO rules) ... into conformity with its obligations,\" the WTO panel . In a statement, Mexico economy ministry applauded the WTO decision, adding it could eventually take measures against the United States if any possible appeal process were to back the latest resolution. Mexico has been fighting for more than 20  over rules the country argues have frozen its fishing industry out of a U.S. imported canned tuna market worth $680 million in 2014. Mexico has about a 3.5 percent share. The clash arose because yellowfin tuna swim with dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific, where Mexico fleet operates, using speedboats to herd the dolphins and large purse seine nets to catch the tuna swimming beneath them. Millions of dolphins were killed before international conservation efforts set standards to protect dolphins and put professional observers on ships to record each tuna catch. Mexico argued the agreements cut dolphin deaths to minimal levels below the thresholds allowed in U.S. fisheries and that tuna from other regions does not face the same stringent tests, with ship captains allowed to selfcertify that no dolphins were harmed. But the United States argued it was reasonable to make distinctions between products based on fishing methods and  Mexico had not shown any cases of a ship captain lying about dolphin deaths. U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Andrew Bates  the United States was pleased the WTO compliance panel found it was entitled to disqualify tuna caught in purse seine nets, but disappointed that the WTO found the measures discriminatory.

       " 'China amends bank IT rules Chen Yang 15 April 2015 Global Times China foreign ministry on Tuesday  China is amending the new bank information technology rules and called for understanding of and respect for the country efforts to strengthen banking security, after several foreign trade groups urged China to suspend the rules. \"Chinese authorities are amending the rules after seeking advice from various parties,\" foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a regular press briefing on Tuesday. \"It is very necessary to promote information security in the banking industry, and many countries have released laws and rules that aim to enhance Internet and information security.\" The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the top banking regulator, released a guideline to strengthen the banking industry information security in September 2014, requiring banks to procure \"secure and controllable information and communications technology (ICT) products and services\" for up to 75 percent of their systems by 2019. The move has raised concerns from some foreign trade associations, who  that it could close the door for many foreign IT companies such as IBM, Oracle and EMC to the Chinese banking IT market. \"We hope related parties can understand and respect China efforts at strengthening the IT products\\' security in the banking industry,\" Hong , adding that China will not change its openingup policy and commitment to implementing WTO rules. A total of 31 trade associations, including the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and the Japan Chamber of Commerce, on Monday urged the Chinese authority to suspend bank information technology rules that were implemented on April 1. The trade associations claimed that the rules \"discriminate against\" foreign providers of Internet and ICT products, solutions and services, Reuters reported, citing a joint open letter written by these trade groups to China Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs. This is not the first time that foreign companies have pressured China on the issue. US officials held highlevel discussions with their Chinese counterparts over the banking rules in the past months, after 18 US trade groups asked China to postpone the regulation. \"The banking industry is the most  sector for foreign IT companies\\' sales revenue in China, which is why they have reacted so fiercely,\" Cao Yujie, consultant director at Beijingbased IT market research firm CCW Research, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Data from IT consultancy IDC shows China banking IT market will be worth more than 18 billion euros ($19.1 billion) by 2017. A senior US Treasury official  on March 30 that China had agreed to suspend implementation of the rules. But the groups which include organizations representing companies like Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google  banks were continuing to implement the rules, Reuters reported. The CBRC  in a statement on February 12 that the new rules will apply equally to all companies regardless of national origin. The CBRC also alleviated the concerns of foreign IT companies by stating that it is still considering whether to ask ICT suppliers to file their software source codes, which will be implemented after consultations, according to the statement. \"Foreign suppliers have concerns that turning over source codes will put their intellectual property at risk,\" Cao . \"But from the banks\\' viewpoint, filing source codes could help them minimize potential risks if they encounter information security problems in the future.\" Bai Ming, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation,  ensuring cyber security is the banking industry priority. \"Cyber security in the banking industry not only concerns depositors\\' interests but the country financial security as well,\" he told the Global Times Tuesday. \"Many countries have adopted similar approaches to the issue.\" The 31 trade associations  on Monday that they were also concerned about similar initiatives in the telecommunications sector. \"If implemented in other sectors, these policies would threaten the ability of European IT companies to participate in the overall ICT market worth 411 billion euros in China,\" the European Services Forum  in a separate letter released on February 25. Xiang Ligang, CEO of telecom industry information portal cctime.com, told the Global Times Tuesday that foreign trade groups are overestimating the impact of a similar initiative on the telecom sector. \"The telecom industry reliance on foreign technology is not as much as the banking industry,\" he . \"Purchases from foreign suppliers only account for less than a quarter of the total market, due to the high competitiveness of domestic rivals such as Huawei.\"',\n",
       " 'China tells Europe not to ignore its new trade status * Application of WTO rules set to define SinoEU ties * EU lawyers say EU cannot ignore rules on China status By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, April 14 (Reuters) China top diplomat in Brussels warned the European Union on Tuesday not to disregard changes to global trade rules set to favour Beijing and which European companies fear will open the bloc to a flood of cheap Chinese goods. World trading powers including Europe are in a bind over how to interpret a World Trade Organization protocol that treats China as a more marketbased economy from late 2016 a status that will make it harder for the EU to protect local industry. The decision will shape SinoEU relations for  to come, either souring ties or potentially building goodwill as China opens up its markets, despite the risks to EU firms at home. \"This is not something bilateral (with the European Union),\" China ambassador to the EU, Yang Yanyi, told the European Parliament trade committee in rare public comments by China on the highly sensitive issue. \"According to the WTO, China will obtain this market economy status in 2016, next . So we hope that all sides abide by WTO rules and don\\'t resort to protectionism and prudently use trade defence instruments,\" she told lawmakers. The issue is likely to be at the centre of an EUChina summit that Yang  would take place in Brussels in June. The 28country European Union needs to decide on its approach soon because of the legislative changes it will entail and parliament approval. The WTO recognised when Communist China joined the trade body in 2001 that its local prices are not set by market forces but  limitations on its exports would expire 15  after the date of accession. WTO members can normally apply punitive \"antidumping\" tariffs on others only if export prices are below those in the exporter home market. But with China, the EU and others have been able to ignore low domestic prices and set tariffs to make Chinese exports as expensive as in wealthier countries. Those WTO limitations on China appear to expire on Dec. 11, 2016, although it is not clear exactly what that implies. As reported exclusively by Reuters this month, the European Commission legal service has warned the EU would not have a good case to disregard the expiration of China right to claim equal treatment with its competitors. European manufacturers have their own legal analysis. \"Only with AliceinWonderland logic could a stateplanned economy become a market economy just by the mere passage of time,\"  Milan Nitzschke, a German solar power executive who has led efforts to protect the EU solar industry from unfairly cheap Chinese imports.

       " \"WTO Disputes With China, Indonesia Ready to Advance April 22, USTR Says By Len Bracken WTO Reporter, April 13, 2015 April 10 — Separate trade disputes launched by the U.S. against China and Indonesia are ready to advance at an April 22 meeting of the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)  April 10 in a press statement. The USTR  the Dispute Settlement Body will establish a dispute panel concerning China “Demonstration BasesCommon Service Platform” export subsidy program at the April 22 meeting. In February the U.S. announced that it was pursuing consultations with China at the World Trade Organization over the Chinese use of export subsidies through a program that the U.S. says unfairly benefits seven industries: (1) textiles, apparel and footwear; (2) advanced materials, such as speciality steel, titanium and aluminum products; (3) light industry; (4) speciality chemicals; (5) medical products; (6) hardware and building materials; and (7) agriculture (29 WTO, 2/12/15). Consultations are the first phase in a WTO dispute, and if they fail to resolve the issue, the complainant can request that a dispute panel be established. Indonesia Dispute Progresses The USTR  it is asking that the Dispute Settlement Body consider the establishment of a panel at the same April 22 meeting concerning a U.S. dispute launched in March against Indonesia challenging a multitude of import licensing restrictions imposed on horticulture, animals and animal products. The U.S. and New Zealand jointly launched the legal challenge against regulations issued by the Indonesian ministries of trade and agriculture establishing various import licensing requirements that allegedly restrict trade in several ways, notably via quantitative limits, timing mandates and minimum prices. The U.S. is also challenging an Indonesian ban on American poultry dating to 2009, and also bans on certain meat products. In addition to the poultry ban, exports of U.S. beef, apples, grapes, potatoes and horticultural products are adversely affected by the import restrictions (53 WTO, 3/19/15). “These challenges to harmful Chinese and Indonesian policies underscore that the Obama Administration is determined to assertively enforce U.S. rights under our trade agreements so that we can promote the interests of American workers and businesses of all sizes,”  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in the statement. “Under President [Barack] Obama leadership, the United States will continue to hold countries like China and Indonesia to account at the WTO so we can unlock all the economic opportunities we've negotiated in our agreements and help trade deliver for Main Street.”\",\n",
       " 'India may take WTO action against EU over drug clinical trials GVK MUMBAI | By Zeba Siddiqui April 15, 2015 (Reuters) India may go to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) if the European Union does not reconsider its decision to suspend the sale of about 700 generic drugs that were approved based on clinical trials by GVK Biosciences Pvt Ltd, the firm CEO . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspension became effective in January, a month after France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg suspended the sale of 25 generic drugs that were approved based on trials conducted by GVK Biosciences. The privatelyheld company, part of India infrastructure builder GVK Group, conducts clinical research for domestic and foreign drugmakers. The regulatory actions were taken after the French watchdog inspected a GVK Biosciences manufacturing plant in southern India last  and found manipulation of data from electrocardiograms (ECG) for at least five . The French regulator  at the time that suspensions were taken out of precaution and there was no reason to suggest the drugs were ineffective or harmful. The drugs suspended by the EMA include those made by U.S. firms Mylan Inc (MYL.O) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), as well as large India companies such as Lupin Ltd (LUPN.NS) and Dr Reddy Laboratories (REDY.NS). After an appeal by the company, the India government set up a panel of experts last  to investigate the matter and found no manipulation, GVK Biosciences CEO Manni Kantipudi told Reuters. An India government delegation visited the European authorities between February and March to ask that the suspension be reconsidered, Kantipudi . If that does not happen, New Delhi is ready to take commercial and legal action, which could include action at the WTO, India Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher told local daily Hindu BusinessLine last week. The commerce department did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters. \"There are some legal options, but we will see what comes out of these diplomatic talks and then we and the commerce ministry will decide on what to do,\" Katipudi .

       " 'France tells cigarette companies to use plain packs PARIS, April 14 (Reuters) France, home of historic Gitanes and Gauloises cigarettes with their iconic blueandwhite packaging, will require all tobacco companies to sell their wares in plain boxes from next  in an antismoking crackdown. The measure is part of a reform passed in the lower house of parliament on Tuesday that also includes laws aimed at fighting anorexia, and new arrangements for funding consultations with doctors which have triggered major street protests by medics. Tobacco firms will from May 2016 have to sell cigarettes in plain packaging with photographs of internal organs damaged by smoking, with the brand appearing only in small lettering. Smoking will be banned in the presence of children in cars, as will the use of electronic cigarettes on public transport and offices. Just under one in four French adults smoke daily about the average for the European Union, a 2012 report by the Parisbased OECD think tank found. Foreign brands now dominate the market, with Gitanes and Gauloises now only smoked by a minority. Measures banning excessively thin fashion models and websites that condone anorexia have already been passed in the same reform package, which also allows local authorities to experimentally set aside safe premises for use by drug addicts. President Francois Hollande ruling Socialists argue the reform includes longoverdue social advances and will also improve access to care in a country long admired for a health service now sometimes struggling to keep up with demand. In particular, recent highprofile cases of pregnant women not reaching a maternity clinic in time to give birth there have highlighted the plight of socalled \"medical deserts\", largely rural zones badly served by hospitals and doctors. \"We have long  it is time to get rid of inequalities in healthcare that is the aim of this reform,\" Health Minister Marisol Touraine told parliament before the vote. But doctors\\' unions vowed to pursue protests against a law making doctor consultations widely free for the patient at the point of use and requiring the general practitioner to seek payment from the fund a measure they say will leave them out of pocket despite clauses promising fast reimbursement. While there are many exceptions, the current practice is to pay 23 euros upfront for a consultation and be reimbursed by the public health insurance fund later an arrangement the government argues puts many lowearners off going to the doctor. The law was passed in the lower house despite votes against from opposition conservatives. It will now go to the Senate upper house where some modifications are still possible.

       " 'Europe to accuse Google of illegally abusing its dominance Alex Barker and Christian Oliver in Brussels, AnneSylvaine in Paris, and Richard Waters in San Francisco Financial Times Last updated:April 15, 2015 1:32 am Google will on Wednesday be accused by Brussels of illegally abusing its dominance of the internet search market in Europe, a step that ultimately could force it to change its business model fundamentally and pay hefty fines. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, is to say that the US group will soon be served with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached antitrust rules by diverting traffic from rivals to favour its own services, according to two people familiar with the case. The initial charge will focus on product searches where Google is accused of harming other shopping sites, but could be extended to other areas. Google confirmed the imminent charges in an internal email sent to staff on Tuesday. “We have a very strong case, with especially good arguments when it comes to better services for consumers and increased competition,” it  in the communication, a copy of which was obtained by the Financial Times. Serving Google with a socalled statement of objections will be the opening salvo in one of the defining antitrust cases of the internet era. It could prove as epic as the decadelong battle with Microsoft that ultimately cost the company €2bn in fines. The commission’s move comes after a torrid five investigation that Google came close to settling without charges last . The draft deal collapsed after fierce objections were raised by ministers in France and Germany, and by some of the continent’s most powerful telecoms and media groups. In a further blow to the US group, Ms Vestager on Wednesday will also launch a separate formal investigation into Google’s Android operating system for smartphones. The commission probe will examine whether Google imposes uncompetitive terms on handset makers that ultimately favour its own lucrative apps such as YouTube. Google rejects any allegations of wrongdoing and says Android is an open platform distributed free. Confirming that it was also expecting a formal investigation into Android, Google  in its internal email to staff that consumers were free to choose for themselves which apps they wanted to download. “Many of the apps come preloaded on Android devices,” for instance with Samsung’s flagship S6 smartphone carrying apps from rivals like Facebook and Microsoft as well as Google, it added. The EU’s antitrust case comes against the backdrop of European discontent with Silicon Valley and the economic disruption of the digital age. Once lauded for their innovative spirit, big US tech groups have come under criticism in Europe over their market dominance and the way they handle personal data, especially in the wake of the US internet surveillance scandal. A decision on charges is to be taken by the college of 28 EU commissioners on Wednesday. Some commissioners are concerned that Ms Vestager has, according to one source, restructured and narrowed the case she inherited from her predecessor Joaquín Almunia. As well as search issues, the investigation has looked at allegations that Google illegally scrapes content from rivals, locks some publishers into using Google search ads, and makes it hard for advertisers to move campaigns to rival search engines. Although Google has faced antitrust questions on three continents for several , the EU move is the first time the company has been accused of formal wrongdoing. It will be given 10 weeks to respond to the allegations and will have the opportunity to call a hearing to make its defence. Ultimately, the commission has the power to levy fines of up to 10 per cent of Google’s global turnover and can impose farreaching curbs on its business practices. Almost 20 complainants against Google want the search engine to abide by strict rules that ensure its formula treats its own services — providing results for travel, shopping and maps — no differently from rivals. Google and the commission declined to comment. Revealing our algorithms — our intellectual property — would lead to the gaming of our results, which would be a bad experience for users Google According to two people familiar with the case, the regulators have narrowed their complaint to the way Google handles product searches. That could limit the impact of the case to online shopping and leave Google rivals in other specialised fields out in the cold. Google confirmed the focus of the charges in its internal email to staff. The Commission’s statement of objections would involve “the display and ranking of certain search results, in particular shopping”, it . “This is obviously very disappointing news, especially for the search team that has worked so hard to create a great experience for our users over the last 16 .” It went on to show trends in traffic to various shopping sites since 2006 that it claimed proved that competition in the sector had not been harmed. The company could still seek to settle the case even after the charges are brought. It could take at least a  and probably longer for the commission to make a final decision. Google would probably challenge any ruling that goes against it through the European courts, opening a legal war that could run for . The commission’s long attempt to settle the case with Google under Ms Vestager’s predecessor Mr Almunia made it one of the most fraught and politically charged antitrust cases to be dealt with by Brussels. Google supporters feel the commission’s volteface on a settlement reflected politics rather than an independent assessment. No EU antitrust case has ever been extended to three settlement offers, or been revived after complainants were formally warned that their case was about to be rejected. On top of the pressure from Brussels, this week Google is also under scrutiny in France where lawmakers are considering an initiative that would force it to hand over its secret formula for ranking websites. The French senate is likely to adopt a bill this week which would allow the country’s national telecoms regulator to monitor search engines’ algorithms, with sweeping powers to ensure its results are fair and nondiscriminatory. The French initiative will become law only if it is adopted by the senate and the lower house of parliament and will also require government backing. Critics complain that Google’s algorithm can be skewed to hurt rivals and want it published to ensure accountability. Google argues such transparency would make its search engine a target for spam and hand rivals its business secrets free. Google in France : “We’re transparent about what ranks well on Google, including when we make changes, but by definition, not everyone can come top. Revealing our algorithms — our intellectual property — would lead to the gaming of our results, which would be a bad experience for users.” The amendment, proposed by the centreright and attached to an economic reform bill assembled by economy minister Emmanuel Macron, has yet to secure the government backing needed to survive the legislative process and pass in the National Assembly. But Catherine MorinDesailly, chair of the culture, education and communication committee, told the Financial Times that discussions with the government were encouraging. “The government is well aware of the issues,” Ms MorinDesailly . “It’s a question of ensuring fairness. Too many businesses view search engines as bottlenecks. The net is tightening around [Google].” If approved, the proposal would give Arcep, France’s telecoms regulator, powers to scrutinise any search engine that had sufficient power to “structure the functioning of the digital economy”. Google would be required to provide links to at least three rival search engines on its homepage, and disclose to users the “general principles of ranking”.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Moves to Take Cuba Off Terror List By Felicia Schwartz and Jose de Cordoba 15 April 2015 The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON President Barack Obama backed the removal of Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a critical move toward restoring diplomatic relations. Havana will still face a variety of sanctions after it is removed from the list, but the step will likely prompt renewed interest from businesses and banks wary of entering the Cuban market. Mr. Obama made a formal recommendation to Congress, setting in motion a 45day review process during which lawmakers can take steps to block the move. However, Congress isn\\'t expected to block it and lawmakers would have to enact a joint resolution to do so, which Mr. Obama could then veto. The president shift sets the stage for the two countries to formally reopen their embassies. But additional steps to normalize relations, such as further easing travel and trade restrictions, will require congressional action. Mr. Obama met over the weekend in Panama with Cuban President Raul Castro, the first summit between the two countries in more than 50 . \"While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements fall outside of the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" Secretary of State John Kerry . \"Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated . . . because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America.\" Still, after three rounds of talks in Havana and Washington, diplomats aren\\'t ready to move forward with fully restoring embassies. The U.S. and Cuba both operate interests sections in each others capitals that mostly provide consular services but don\\'t include a full ambassador. The U.S. wants to make sure its diplomats can move freely around the island and that Cubans have full access to the embassy. Cuba tied its presence on the list to the diplomatic negotiations to reopen embassies, which both sides hoped could be completed before the Summit of the Americas in Panama. Officials in the Cuban interest section in Washington didn\\'t respond to requests to comment. Removing Cuba from the list will eliminate some sanctions, including restrictions on foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and other financial regulations, though the embargo remains in place, U.S. officials . In December, when the administration announced the U.S. would move to normalize ties, Mr. Obama took initial steps to loosen financial regulations. But with the embargo and the terror designation in place, many banks and other companies have been wary of doing business on the island. Pedro Freyre, the International Practice Chair of national law firm Akerman LLP,  Cuba delisting would help Havana with international banks that have shied away from any relationship with the communist island so as not to face U.S. ire. Cuba also remains ineligible for loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Freyre . Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla), a Republican candidate for the presidency and a CubanAmerican,  Cuba should remain on the terror list. \"The decision made by the White House today is a terrible one,\" he . Some Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who has sponsored legislation to allow full travel to Cuba, welcomed the news.',\n",

The Energy Information Administration annual energy outlook found that net energy imports would fall to zero by 2028 under its base case or in just four  if oil prices or resources sharply exceeded expectations. It was the agency first annual outlook since oil markets began to collapse last , dragging prices to six lows. In its base case, Brent crude would remain below $80 per barrel until 2020, well below its projection a  ago. The international oil marker was $58.72 per barrel yesterday, up 1.4 per cent. Companies are exporting some of the US energy bounty despite a fourdecadeold ban on crude oil exports. Cheniere Energy plans to begin liquefying US natural gas for export at a Louisiana terminal this . Refiners such as Valero are exporting record amounts of refined oil products such as diesel, while BHP Billiton and other producers have begun to export ultralight condensate after the White House loosened the crude export ban. The energy trade deficit has shrunk 54 per cent from a $416bn peak in 2008. Adam Sieminski of the EIA : \"With continued growth in oil and natural gas production, growth in the use of renewables, and application of demandside efficiencies, projections show the potential to eliminate net US energy imports in the 202030 timeframe.\" Because of refineries\\' appetite for crude, the US continues to be a large net importer with volumes of nearly 5m barrels per day.

The forthcoming meeting will take a factual and objective evaluation of issues that have lingered within the rules negotiations since 2011. The chairman of the WTO Rules Negotiating Committee, Wayne McCook of Jamaica, proposed the informational briefing at an April 14 committee session. McCook  that members “recognized the need for recalibration and are prepared to engage concretely in the search for doables, although the degree of ambition varies among them.” Rules Negotiations Flounder Members are seeking to address the remaining Bali ministerial goals of liberalizing multilateral rules regarding agriculture, nonagricultural market access (NAMA) and services. They hope to advance a detailed work program by July 31 that may ultimately conclude the 2001 Doha round. Part of the members' work includes negotiations to modernize the Antidumping Agreement and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The negotiations also include discussions on improving disciplines on fisheries subsidies and WTO provisions applying to regional trade agreements. These discussions, known generally as the rules negotiations, have fallen to the back burner as members failed to make significant headway in agricultural negations in recent months. Members have divided opinions as to whether rules should be included in the postBali work program at all. WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevedo recently told members that they should address all Doha round issues together to ensure that progress in one area is not dragged down by a lack of consideration in other negotiations, such as rules. Divisions Remain Developed nations like Australia, Canada and the U.S. questioned whether it would be a productive use of time to rehash old issues that have long burdened the rules negotiations.

       " 'TISA Round This Week Focuses On U.S. Priorities, Sensitivities World Trade Online Posted: April 15, 2015 The twelfth round of negotiations for a Trade In Services Agreement (TISA) being held in Geneva this week focuses on five priority areas, some of which represent U.S. priorities and others that are sensitive for Washington. The April 1317 round focuses on financial services, telecommunications, and domestic regulation, which are priorities for the U.S. and other participants, including the European Union. The agenda also includes maritime transport and movement of natural persons as service suppliers, according to an April 13 announcement by the European Commission. The EU is chairing this week’s round. The latter two areas are sensitive for the U.S. because maritime trade is governed by the Jones Act, which generally prohibits any foreign built or foreign flagged vessel from engaging in coastwise trade within the United States. The temporary movement of natural persons is controversial to the U.S. because it is perceived as linked to immigration policy by the congressional committees of jurisdiction. The aim of focusing on these five issues is to reach agreement on all but the most controversial elements by a July stocktaking session. Members agreed to narrow their focus at the last round in February after they found an overcrowded agenda yielded little progress. The commission announcement highlights the focus on preparing the July meeting, saying negotiators are aiming to identify the “deal breakers” in each of the issues on the April agenda and define the perimeters of the agreement. The April meeting will also review progress made in the negotiations so far, including on market access. The commission announcement notes that all participants but Pakistan, Paraguay and Uruguay have made their initial offer, but does not mention that the offers by Canada and Mexico omit key sectors.

The World Trade Organization has found that modifications to U.S. regulations on \"dolphin safe\" cannedtuna labeling still discriminate against Mexico, authorities here . A special WTO group found that changes to U.S. tuna labeling regulations continue to \"restrict trade and do not meet that country objective to inform consumers about harm done to dolphins during the tunacatching process,\" Mexico Economy Secretariat  Tuesday. \"The WTO once again has sided with Mexico, finding that Mexico fishing method is able to certify and ensure protection for dolphins, whereas other methods cannot provide the same degree of certainty, and yet they carry the \\'dolphin safe\\' label.\" The United States has  it will appeal. If the WTO special group findings are upheld later this , Mexico would have the right to take retaliatory measures until the discriminatory aspects of U.S. tuna labeling are eliminated. Stricter U.S. rules adopted in 2013 barred tuna caught by setting on dolphins the method used in Mexico Eastern Tropical Pacific, or ETP, large purse seine fishery from accessing the \"dolphinsafe\" label. They also imposed more onerous certification and tracking and verification requirements on tuna caught in the ETP to ensure no harm was done to dolphins. In its latest findings, the WTO ruled against Mexico on one aspect, saying \"the different harms caused by setting on dolphins on the one hand and other tuna fishing methods on the other hand justified the United States\\' decision to treat those fishing methods differently.\" However, it agreed with Mexico that the United States\\' different certification and tracking and verification requirements discriminated against the Latin American country.

The April 14 ruling also expanded the scope of U.S. violations when compared to previous WTO rulings, finding the U.S. violated not only the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) but also the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The U.S. plans to appeal the ruling “in the coming months,” Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,  in an April 14 statement. The compliance panel core finding was that the U.S. tuna labeling rule as amended in 2013 continued to violate Article 2.1 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which requires countries to ensure that their technical regulations accord products from other WTO members treatment that is no less favorable than that provided to like products originating domestically or in third countries. The U.S. measure did so because it required more onerous certification that no dolphins were harmed for tuna caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), where the bulk of the Mexican fleet operates, than in other oceans, the panel found. Specifically, the amended U.S. measure requires tuna caught in the ETP to be accompanied by a statement from an independent expert observer saying that no dolphins were harmed or intentionally encircled by a fishing net in order to qualify for the “dolphin safe” label. By contrast, ships operating outside the ETP need only to provide a certification by the captain that no dolphins were seriously injured or killed in a tuna catch. The certification requirement for ships operating outside the ETP was strengthened in the 2013 rule in order to try to bring the U.S. into compliance with a 2012 Appellate Body ruling that found the labeling rules were not evenhanded in addressing the risks to dolphins. Prior to the change, ship captains outside the ETP only had to certify that they had not intentionally encircled dolphins with a net in order to target schools of tuna congregating under them. But the compliance panel ruled that this new certification requirement still fails to sufficiently match the rigor of the labeling requirement for tuna caught in the ETP. In doing so, it rejected the U.S. defense that the different treatment resulted from a “legitimate regulatory distinction.” The WTO Appellate Body has established in previous rulings that members\\' technical regulations can discriminate between like products without violating TBT Article 2.1, if a party demonstrates that it has a legitimate regulatory reason for doing so. The U.S. had argued that the amended measure was sufficiently \"calibrated\" to address the different levels of risks to dolphins in the ETP and in other oceans. Within the ETP, tuna naturally associate with dolphins, making dolphins a bigger target for fishing vessels seeking schools of tuna and putting them at bigger risk of becoming bycatch. But the panel rejected the U.S. argument because it found ship captains outside the ETP were not equipped with the skills to make a reliable certification that no dolphins were harmed, and therefore that the amended U.S. measure does not address the risks to dolphins in fisheries other than the ETP. It therefore found that the different treatment does not stem from a \"legitimate regulatory distinction.” In contrast to the initial panel ruling in 2011, the compliance panel found the U.S. had violated Articles I:1 and III:4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which deal with mostfavored nation treatment and national treatment, respectively. The initial panel did not rule on these GATT claims due to judicial economy, but the Appellate Body  it was incorrect not to do so, according to one lawyer following the case. The compliance panel based its ruling on GATT Article I and III on similar grounds to its finding under TBT Article 2.1. It found that the differing certification requirements in the amended rule discriminated between Mexican tuna and tuna caught outside the ETP. The compliance panel also found that the U.S. could not shield the measure under Article XX of the GATT by claiming the measure was necessary to protect an exhaustible natural resource, as it failed to meet the \"chapeau\" language of that article which requires that measures not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination. In order to reach that conclusion, it essentially applied the same logic that it used under Article 2.1 that the differing certification requirements were not the result of a legitimate regulatory distinction. \"In the Panel view, the findings we made in the context of Article 2.1 apply with equal force in the context of the chapeau of Article XX,\" it wrote. \"Insofar as the different certification requirements are not justified by the objective of conserving dolphins by providing consumers with accurate information about the dolphinsafe status of tuna products, we find that this aspect of the amended tuna measure is unjustifiably and arbitrarily discriminatory.\" The U.S. did win on one point in the ruling, which was the panel finding that the U.S. was justified in prohibiting tuna caught by intentionally setting nets on dolphins from obtaining the dolphinsafe label. In more clear terms than the Appellate Body, it ruled that this requirement was consistent with Article 2.1. Mexico challenged that this prohibition is unwarranted because tuna can be caught without harm to dolphins using this method, whereas other fishing methods can lead to greater bycatch of other marine life. But the panel accepted that there is evidence that encircling dolphins is particularly harmful to the animals. Bates, the USTR spokesman,  the U.S. was pleased with that aspect of the decision and characterized it as a “mixed ruling.” The Mexican Secretariat of Economy issued a statement welcoming the ruling but did not say whether it would appeal the aspect of the ruling where it failed to succeed. Under the Dispute Settlement Understanding, a party has a maximum of 60 days to appeal a panel report, although a party can seek to have the report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body sooner, shortening the timeline. But once one party appeals a report, the other party has only five days to notify its own appeal. The Mexican statement noted that if the U.S. does not appeal or fails in any eventual appeal Mexico will have the right to impose trade retaliation. \"The decision of the WTO is another  victory not only for Mexico, but for the environment and all marine species, as well as for consumers who trust in the accuracy of environmental labeling,\" the statement .',\n",
       " 'WTO appellate body rejects Vietnam’s appeal of US antidumping duties on shrimp Mayer Brown LLP Duane W. Layton, Paulette Vander Schueren and Adrian Verdegay Mena USA, Vietnam Lexology April 14 2015 The Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has circulated its report in the dispute (reference DS429) brought by Vietnam challenging the imposition of antidumping duties by the United States on imports of frozen warmwater shrimp. The Appellate Body’s report also addressed claims by Vietnam with respect to certain US laws, methodologies and practices of the US Department of Commerce (USDOC). WTO Panel Ruling Under Review The original dispute concerned claims made by Vietnam with respect to the USDOC’s final determinations in various administrative “reviews” of the antidumping duty order. Additionally, Vietnam made claims with respect to the USDOC’s likelihoodofdumping determination within the expiry review affecting the same product. Other claims brought by Vietnam before the WTO panel included the USDOC’s “zeroing” methodology; the USDOC’s practice with respect to the socalled nonmarket economy (NME) wide entity rate; and Section 129(c)(1) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). Section 129 of the URAA creates a mechanism governing the implementation of WTO rulings in relation to trade defense investigations. In particular, Section 129(c)(1) provides that Section 129 determinations apply to entries made on or after the date when the US Trade Representative directs the USDOC to revoke or implement a Section 129 determination. The WTO panel found, inter alia, that (i) Vietnam had failed to establish that the USDOC’s simple zeroing methodology in administrative reviews is “a measure of general and prospective application that can be challenged ‘as such’”; (ii) the USDOC’s application of its simple zeroing methodology to calculate dumping “margins” for Vietnam’s shrimp exporters was inconsistent with Article 9.3 of the WTO Antidumping Agreement (AD Agreement); (iii) the USDOC’s practice of assuming that all producers in an NME country belong to a single countrywide entity and assigning a single rate to these producers/exporters is inconsistent with Articles 6.10 and 9.2 of the AD Agreement; (iv) Vietnam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) of the URAA is inconsistent “as such” with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, and 18.1 of the AD Agreement; and (v) the US acted inconsistently with Articles 11.2 and 11.3 of the AD Agreement as a result of the USDOC’s reliance on WTOinconsistent margins of dumping in its likelihoodofdumping determination as well as its treatment of requests for revocation made by certain Vietnamese exporters not being individually examined. Appellate Body Ruling On January 6, 2015, Vietnam notified the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of its intention to appeal the WTO panel ruling. In its appeal Vietnam claimed that the panel had acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) by finding that Vietnam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) of URAA precluded implementation of recommendations and rulings of the DSB with respect to prior unliquidated entries. Vietnam also appealed the WTO panel’s finding that Vietnam had not established that Section 129(c)(1) is inconsistent “as such” with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, and 18.1 of the AD Agreement. The Appellate Body upheld the panel’s analytical framework when examining that Vietnam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) did not, in and of itself, preclude the implementation of WTO recommendations and rulings with respect to prior unliquidated entries. The Appellate Body also rejected Vietnam’s claim that the panel had not properly relied on the various elements that it examined to inform its understanding of the meaning and effect of Section 129(c)(1). As a result, the Appellate Body found that Vietnam had not established that the panel acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU. Consequently, the Appellate Body did not need to address Vietnam’s request that Section 129(c)(1) was inconsistent “as such” with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, and 18.1 of the WTO AD Agreement.',\n",
       " 'India may take WTO action against EU over drug clinical trials GVK By Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI, April 15 (Reuters) India may go to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) if the European Union does not reconsider a decision to suspend the sale of about 700 generic drugs that were approved based on clinical trials by GVK Biosciences Pvt Ltd, the firm CEO . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspension became effective in January, a month after France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg suspended the sale of 25 generic drugs that were approved based on trials conducted by GVK Biosciences. The privatelyheld company, part of India infrastructure builder GVK Group, conducts clinical research for domestic and foreign drugmakers. The regulatory actions were taken after the French watchdog inspected a GVK Biosciences manufacturing plant in southern India last  and found manipulation of data from electrocardiograms for at least five . The French regulator  at the time that suspensions were taken out of precaution and there was no reason to suggest the drugs were ineffective or harmful. The drugs suspended by the EMA include those made by U.S. firms Mylan Inc and Abbott Laboratories, as well as large India companies such as Lupin Ltd and Dr Reddy Laboratories. After an appeal by the company, the India government set up a panel of experts last  to investigate the matter and found no manipulation, GVK Biosciences CEO Manni Kantipudi told Reuters. An India government delegation visited the European authorities between February and March to ask for the suspension to be reconsidered, Kantipudi . If that does not happen, New Delhi is ready to take commercial and legal action, which could include action at the WTO, India Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher told local daily Hindu BusinessLine last week. The commerce department did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters. \"There are some legal options, but we will see what comes out of these diplomatic talks and then we and the commerce ministry will decide on what to do,\" Kantipudi . In an email, EMA spokeswoman Rebecca Harding confirmed the meeting with the delegation of the India government regarding GVK Biosciences\\' clinical trials, and  a \"reexamination procedure\" is ongoing and is expected to be finalised in May 2015. GVK Biosciences is the latest India firm to come under international scrutiny over quality issues. Several large India drugmakers have over the past two  faced U.S. and UK sanctions over issues ranging from data fabrication and manipulation, to sanitation.

       " 'Abu Dhabi Etihad Airways CEO warns Europeans against protectionism By Stanley Carvalho ABU DHABI, April 15 (Reuters) The boss of Abu Dhabi Etihad Airways has warned Europe that it will suffer if it restricts the access of foreign carriers to its market, in a fresh effort by fastgrowing Gulf airlines to head off what they see as Western protectionism. Chief executive James Hogan met with the European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc this week to stress the benefits of Etihad operations to European consumers and economies, an Etihad statement  on Wednesday. \"Etihad Airways is committed to Europe. But growing resistance to us from a handful of protectionist competitors could have unintended consequences well beyond limiting our development,\" the statement quoted Hogan as saying. \"If our growth is curtailed or our investments in airlines are compromised, the real damage will be to Europe in lost jobs, lost flight connectivity, lost investment in local and national economies and lost consumer choice.\" Stateowned Etihad is making increasing inroads into Europe, partly through equity investments in Air Berlin, Air Serbia, Aer Lingus and Alitalia. This has aroused opposition from European carriers such as Air FranceKLM and Lufthansa, which along with some U.S. competitors have long complained that the Gulf airlines are benefiting unfairly from interestfree government loans and cheap fuel. The Gulf carriers deny those accusations. The Etihad statement did not say which particular business issues Hogan was concerned about in Europe, and a spokesman for the airline declined to comment on Wednesday. Under a bilateral traffic agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Germany, UAE carriers may fly to only four German airports: Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg and Duesseldorf. Last month Germany approved a summer flight schedule allowing Air Berlin and Etihad to share some flights not covered by the agreement, such as BerlinAbu Dhabi and StuttgartAbu Dhabi, but the German transport ministry  last week this \"should remain an exception\".

The remarks during a conference call on the company earnings represented one of the clearest statements yet by U.S. airlines on what they hope talks between the U.S. and the Gulf states would achieve if they take place. Delta and other U.S. airlines have charged their Gulf competitors with receiving more than $40 billion in subsidies from their home governments. This, they say, has allowed them to lower prices and begin pushing U.S. airlines out of key markets. Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have denied the allegations, saying U.S. carriers have lost market share because of inferior service. \"We\\'re in the process of answering questions (from the U.S. government),\" Anderson , \"and the end result needs to be like the Chinese steel case or agricultural cases that the U.S. frequently brings (to the World Trade Organization), where you come up with remedies that will address a subsidy.\" The Obama administration on Friday solicited comments on the debate and  it expected to begin reviewing submissions by the end of May.

In February, India agreed to give preferential treatment to LDCs in the area of services in line with a commitment taken by WTO members to give easier access to both goods and services from poorer countries. New Delhi offered to waive the visa fee for LDC applicants seeking India business and employment visas. It also agreed to give technical assistance and capacity building in financial services, insurance, MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector, agriculture and rural development, railways and speciallydesigned courses in consultancy services. Technical assistance for development of chartered accountancy and company/corporate secretary professions in LDCs was also offered. Improved commitments India took on market access commitments in 15 subsectors and improved commitments in four subsectors and for a number of categories of professionals from LDCs. “The market access offer made by India is entirely made up of what is autonomously available to all countries on a most favoured nation basis. Most of the offers are pegged at the level of India’s revised offers at WTO,” the note . So, India has basically taken on commitments in certain areas of services where it has been offering market access on its own. This means that while no extra market access has been given to LDCs, in future India cannot close down these sectors to LDC exporters even if it chooses to do so for other countries. However, the Ministry clarified that LDC country exports are so small that they do not hold any challenge for the domestic industry. “In fact, in 201314, the share of LDCs in India’s services imports has been a mere 0.60 per cent,” the note . The clarification holds significance as preferential access given to certain countries with which India has Free Trade Agreements elicited criticism recently from both industry and some sections of the Government for allegedly hurting domestic players. In the area of goods, India provides duty free market access on about 96 per cent of items and offers preferential duties for another 2.2 per cent.',\n",
       " 'Brazil removes suspension of tra fish imports from Vietnam 15 April 2015 Vietnam News Summary Brazil’s latest report to the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), states that it has removed the temporary suspension of tra fish imports from Vietnam. Earlier, Brazil suspended licenses of the tra fish imports from Vietnam from September 22nd, 2014 due to concerns over food hygiene and safety. After the suspension, MARD’s Department of Animal Health discussed with relevant agencies of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to send a letter to the Brazilian Department of Animal Health and Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply. According to the letter, the Vietnamese side provided documents to explain that Brazil’s requirement on Vietnam’s emergency plan for the prevention of tra fish diseases was contrary to Vietnam’s technique and in reality also contrary to the regulations of OIE and WTO. Consequently, on March 27th, Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture of Brazil asked the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply of Brazil to reallow imports of Vietnamese tra fish and reverse the decision on suspension of imports of seafood products from Vietnam. Brazil is one of the potential export markets for Vietnamese seafood products. In 2013, the country was among Vietnam’s 10 biggest seafood export markets, valued at USD123 million, reported the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Processors. Of this, tra fish accounted for 99%, worth USD122 million. In 2014, Vietnam passed China to top frozen fillet export in Brazil with about 44,000 tonnes of tra fish in the first eight months this .

       " 'Being a member of the WTO may not be that easy for Russia – article in Russia Direct online magazine 16 April 2015 RIA OreandaNews Economy. Moscow. OREANDANEWS. April 16, 2015. Even though it is still too early to talk about the results of Russia’s accession to the WTO, it is quite clear that in order to enjoy the potential benefits over the long term, Russia should address a range of  domestic factors today. Trade disputes within the World Trade Organization (WTO) are nothing new, something that Russia is quickly finding out after finally joining the WTO in 2012. China is taking steps to counter EU tariff policies on its poultry and meat products, while the European Union is taking more active action in its dispute with Russia and its tariff reatment of paper products, palm oil and refrigerators. Following an unfruitful round of consultations and an initial request to establish a panel that was blocked by Russia (a step allowed by WTO rules), the EU decided to take the case into the Dispute Settlement Body of the organization once again, stating that measures are still in place and continue to severely hamper trade. It was only on March 25 when the WTO finally established a panel to investigate this – currently the fifth case overall against Russia. To those unfamiliar with WTO practices, the establishment of the Dispute Settlement Body does not necessarily mean that one country has started an economic trade war with the other. This is just the usual way the organization operates: The member states challenge each other’s trade policies and negotiate a better way that could benefit all sides the most. These developments show that Russia is taking steps to start using available instruments more actively and support its stand on major trade policy issues. For instance, one of the questions actively posed by Russia in the WTO concerns EU financial sanctions. Keith Rockwell, director of the information and external relations division of the WTO, explained this to Russian journalists at a WTO workshop in Geneva: This issue has come up in the General Council, in the Council of Trading Goods, in the Services Council, because the Russians are concerned that their rights under the services agreement are being violated as part of these sanctions. We’d have to wait and see how this process will work itself out,  Rockwell. Russia’s lack of experience and trade policy specialists Raising concerns and being able to defend one’s interests in current and future disputes is key to ensure that Russia reaps maximum benefits from being a member of the organization. According to Alexey Portanskiy, professor in the faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at the Higher School of Economics, this is only possible when Russians have enough experience with the WTO. Unfortunately, Russia lacks such experience. In this regard Russia’s participation in dispute settlement processes, both as a complainant and a respondent, is key because it allows the country, on the one hand, to protect its interests, and on the other, to accumulate experience in the WTO, explains Tatiana Isachenko, an expert on the WTO with a Ph.D. from Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMOUniversity). Another problem is that Russia does not have enough highly qualified lawyers and specialists in the field of trade policy. Let’s admit that the time for training such professionals has been lost and now we have to make up for that, Portanskiy points out. Indeed, notwithstanding significant changes and the emergence of specialized structures (such as the Center of Expertise on WTO issues, the Information and Analytical Center for Foreign Trade, the Center for the Study of the Tariff and NonTariff Regulation, and the Russian Mission to the WTO), the situation is still difficult and demand for qualified specialists continues to persist, notes Isachenko. The lack of qualified experts and personnel often leads to an erroneous interpretation of the rules and regulations and, as a result, the wrong policy decisions, warns Isachenko. Professionals with knowledge of the WTO rules and possibilities of their application to protect the interests of domestic producers should be represented in all major companies involved in foreign trade activities, as well as domestic producers associations. Russia’s domestic companies are not interested in foreign markets? Apart from the lack of Russian specialists in international trade disputes, the country’s economic interests also suffer from state officials’ unfamiliarity with potential export opportunities, and domestic producers’ disinterest in entering foreign markets, thinks Ivan Rubanov, head of the analytical group of the expert council of the Agricultural Committee of the Russian State Duma. Russia hardly uses the WTO mechanisms when it comes to promoting domestic agricultural products. Our agricultural exports are still rather low and represented, to a large extent, by liquid and inexpensive primary products, namely grains and oilseeds. The main problems are provoked by administrative and infrastructure barriers at home, not abroad, he told Russia Direct . In addition, the expert says, the majority of Russian companies are not competitive enough for developed markets, plus they seem more enthusiastic about new importsubstitution opportunities. Vladimir Salamatov, director general of the World Trade Center Moscow, also acknowledges the positive incentive that the devaluation of Russian national currency gave to Russian enterprises. At the moment, the devaluation of the ruble creates an additional protection from imports; however, it does not give domestic producers a reason to relax, but, on the contrary, to increase their competitiveness and produce goods that will be in demand not only on the territory of the Customs Union, but on other global markets as well, he says. Salamatov shares the opinion of the Minister for Trade of the Eurasian Economic Commission Andrei Slepnev in saying that the current economic goal should be not importsubstitution in itself, but rather the creation of products that are competitive not only at home, but also abroad. Substitution with outdated and unprofitable products does not make any sense. Nothing can promote growth better than competition, he points out. Encouraging domestic producers to enter foreign markets, eradicating administrative barriers and helping local producers get cheaper loans and create sufficient infrastructure will allow small and medium enterprises to increase their share of the GDP from the current 20 percent to the worldwide average share of 5060 percent, Salamatov believes. Improving the dialogue between government and business Another urgent question in the context of Russia’s membership in the WTO concerns the effectiveness of governmentbusiness dialogue, which should consist of an open discussion of state economic policy and business participation in the future policymaking processes. What is  here is that the government should be able to quickly address the concerns and feedback coming from the business community, points out Portanskiy. Unfortunately, we have not achieved this ideal yet: Government officials do not always react to what business representatives are saying, and those speaking for the business are often big business alliances, such as The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RSPP], and do not always represent the interests of the whole business community, the expert believes. The business community should be able to debate with the authorities the major political and economic issues that might potentially have a longterm impact on the business environment. According to Isachenko, in order to address this issue it is necessary to organize the work in a systematic way interacting with industry associations of domestic producers. The main goal should be to convince Russian firms that the WTO agenda is directly related to their business activities. During the negotiations on Russia accession to the WTO and during the last two , RSPP and the Russian Business Council held a significant number of roundtables and seminars on these issues, but in practice, it was not enough, she says. What are Russia’s achievements so far? According to the data provided by the World Trade Center Moscow, as a result of two  in the WTO, Russian exports grew by 1.8 percent. This seems to be a relatively small gain, but if looking at specific industries, this number will grow significantly. Although exports of metals and chemical products fell, by 3 and 10 percent respectively, other areas enjoyed an increase in their exports: Machinery and equipment exports grew by 16 percent, mineral resources – by 2 percent, food products – 5 percent, clothing and shoes – by 26 percent. These signs make us hopeful that membership in the WTO, as planned, will become one of the main drivers of Russian economic growth, says Salamatov.',\n",

The U.S. criticized a recent Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission rule that urges Chinese financial institutions to seek out “indigenous innovation of information technology,” according to a recent U.S. filing. The U.S. officials  they also were concerned that Russia new “anticrisis” economic restructuring plan urges stateowned enterprises to prioritize Russianmade products (60 WTO, 3/30/15). They questioned whether the policies adhere to the TRIMS Agreement, which prohibits WTO members from applying any measure that discriminates against foreign products or that leads to quantitative restrictions. China to Review Measures Chinese trade officials  the financial procurement policy is  to protect the security of its banking sector. The policy requires the Chinese banking industry to ensure all its new computer servers and desktop computers, as well as half of its tablets and smartphones, meet China requirements for “security and controllability.” Although WTO rules permit members to implement cybersecurity measures, the U.S.  such measures prevent foreign technology and telecommunications companies from selling their products to China banking sector. Japan, Canada and the European Union echoed the U.S. concerns. China  it would review the measure but did not commit to modifying its policies.

Since both schemes had local content requirements in some form, they appeared to contravene India G20 commitments on the nonimposition of protectionist measures, it . The EU asked India to provide information on both the schemes and their implementation at the Centre and state levels. India, however, has maintained that the measures in question are consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and TRIMS Agreement. The WTO TRIMS agreement categorises certain measures as traderestrictive or tradedistorting and asks memberstates to refrain from applying measures that would discriminate against foreign products or that would lead to quantitative restrictions. New Delhi is already fighting a case in the WTO on issue of local content requirement in the solar sector. India has always raised its serious concerns over increasing protectionist tendencies by the developed countries especially after the global financial meltdown.

They want special safeguards to insulate small and subsistence farmers from sudden and unforeseen import surges and price declines of farm produce resulting from exports by developed nations, where farming is heavily subsidized. There is a need for such a mechanism, they say, before the longpending Doha round of trade negotiations is concluded. These talks to lay down the rules of global trade collapsed in 2008 precisely over this issue, with the US on the one side and India and China on the other. \"A more simple, operable, and effective safeguard mechanism is needed by all developing countries,\" Iman Pambagyo of Indonesia told the meeting. The aim was \"to better manage ourselves against world prices and supply which are becoming increasingly volatile due to increased climate changeinduced disturbances and persistently high subsidization, and to respond to import surges and price declines that threatens small, subsistence farmers who overwhelmingly reside in the rural areas\", he . Indonesia is the coordinator of the G33, which also includes India, China, Turkey, South Korea, Kenya, Bolivia and Venezuela. The coalition has been waging a battle to safeguard the interests of their small farmers since the Doha trade negotiations started in 2001. India played a key role in the Doha negotiations in strengthening the special safeguards. The talks collapsed in 2008, when the then trade minister Kamal Nath walked out of the meeting saying New Delhi will never sacrifice the interests of its small farmers. The underlying rationale of the mechanism is that when prices of imported farm products drop below a specified level and could cause serious problems for domestic farmers, developing countries must be in a position to raise import levies, imposing what are called safeguard duties. At Wednesday meeting of over two dozen envoys convened by the chair for agriculture negotiations, Indonesia explained why the safeguards are so crucial for the survival of subsistence farmers in the developing world, saying they could not compete with rich farmers in the developed world who receive tens of billions of dollars in subsidies from their governments, according to negotiators familiar with the discussion. The chair, John Adank of New Zealand, sought to know \"who should have access to agriculture safeguards in the future\"; whether \"access to safeguards be linked to commitments to reduce tariffs\"; and whether \"safeguards be available to all tariff lines or to a limited number of lines\". Although industrialized countries managed to secure a Special Safeguard (SSG) instrument in the previous Uruguay round negotiations that led to the establishment of the WTO in 1995, they remain strongly opposed to the idea of special safeguard mechanism (SSM) arguing it would dilute the principles of certainty and predictability in global agriculture trade. Australia, which is the leader for the Cairns Group of 20 agricultural exporting countries that seek complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities without any subsidies, had strongly opposed the continuation of the SSG that is used by farm protectionist countries such as Switzerland, Norway, and Japan as well as the EU. But Australia along with Canada, the EU, Japan, Paraguay and others also opposed the SSM for developing countries, suggesting that it would further undermine market access when the overall level of ambition for reducing farm tariffs is now being \"recalibrated\",  a trade envoy familiar with the discussion. Nevertheless, Australia, Canada, and Chile among others signalled their willingness to discuss a modified SSG for industrialized countries. Indonesia  the SSM \"is a critical deliverable that can never be linked with any Doha tariff reduction disciplines or commitments\". India trade envoy Anjali Prasad strongly defended the G33 proposal, maintaining that developing countries would need pricebased triggers to invoke SSM as and when prices drop below certain specified levels. The G33  price and volume triggers for invoking SSMthe crux of the disputemust be based on the most recent or current market realities that are based on a three rolling average. \"The threedecadeold fixed reference price of 198688 is undoubtedly an outdated and flawed economic basis for triggering the price mechanism in today realities,\" the G33 maintained. In his concluding remarks, Adank  there are still several gaps to be discussed in the market access pillar of the Doha agriculture negotiations, including the need for a modified SSG.',\n",
       " 'Source says India opposes S America tariff cut proposal in WTO 16 April 2015 Cogencis MoneyWire Cogencis, Thursday, Mar 16 . By Kirtika Suneja NEW DELHI India has opposed proposals floated by two South American countries in the World Trade Organization to reduce tariffs by all countries to increase market access, a senior commerce ministry official  \"There have been two different proposals by Argentina and Paraguay and both have simplified versions of cutting tariffs which is a way of getting market access. However, they are silent on food subsidies. India has disagreed with this,\" the official . The two papers are the first to have been floated ahead of the WTO ministerial talks in December in Nairobi. \"A lot of shadow boxing is happening now as countries have to agree on a work programme for the talks by Jul 31 to conclude the Doha round of negotiations. However, no one is coming out openly with what they have to offer,\" the official added. Last , India was able to convince the WTO to find a permanent solution to the food subsidy issue in return of accepting a roadmap for trade facilitation, something that developed countries have been pressing for. G33 countries, which include India, China and the Philippines, want public stockholding for food security purposes to come under \\'Green Box\\' subsidies in the WTO. \\'Green Box\\' subsidies cause no or minimum trade distortion. Under the Agreement on Agriculture of the WTO, subsidies should not breach 10% of the value of production of those crops which are stockpiled. India can be taken through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism if the 10% price support cap is breached . In a notification to the WTO last , India  it did not breach the permissible subsidy levels under WTO rules and gave $56.1 bln in agricultural subsidies in 201011, an over threefold increase from $16.8 bln doled out in 200405. Of this, $24.5 bln was made in \\'green box\\' subsidies (allowed without any cap and are least tradedistorting under WTO) and the rest $31.6 bln includes development programmes such as support for fertilisers, irrigation, electricity and seeds, among others in 201011.

       " 'Egypt supports sugar producers, may slap big tariff on imports CAIRO/GENEVA, April 16 (Reuters) Egypt is considering a 20 percent tariff on white sugar imports as it bolsters its own sugar industry with a subsidised export push, a ministerial statement and a filing at the World Trade Organization  on Thursday. \"It is proposed to impose a provisional safeguard measure in the form of additional duty 20 percent of the CIF (cost, insurance and freight) value with a minimum 700 Egyptian Pounds ($92) per ton,\" Egypt  in its filing to the WTO. Temporary safeguard tariffs are allowed under WTO rules if there is a sudden, unexpected and damaging surge of imports, and if the country that imposes the tariffs first seeks the views of interested parties. But their use has been under increasing scrutiny by authorities concerned they could be a way for countries to skirt the usual trade rules that ban unfair discrimination against foreign goods. In a separate statement, Supplies Minister Khaled Hanafi  Egypt was not using any imported sugar for its subsidy programme and was working to promote brown sugar exports to Kenya. SIIC, which has a monopoly over cane sugar processing in Egypt and is the supplier of sugar for the country subsidy programme, confirmed to Reuters it had not issued any international tenders to buy sugar globally since the summer of last . Hanafi  the ministry was supporting the local cane sugar industry which had suffered the effects of a global drop in sugar prices as a result of oversupply. Prices for local cane sugar were increased from 360 Egyptian pounds ($47) a tonne to 400 pounds a tonne with the ministry of supply also subsidising SIIC by paying 100 pounds a tonne for every tonne of cane sugar the company purchased locally. Hanafi also  Egypt was seeking to export some of SIIC production to several countries in Africa and was in talks with Kenya for the export of brown sugar. Egypt consumes around 3.2 million tonnes of sugar annually but produces just over 2 million tonnes leaving a gap of slightly over a million tonnes a  for imports. The North African country, which depends on the Nile for almost all its water, is trying to expand sugar beet planting to fulfil its sugar needs as it consumes less water than cane. Beet is mostly grown in the Nile Delta region while cane is grown in southern Egypt. Several private sugar plants have set up shop to process beet sugar in the past  including Nile Sugar and Al Nouran sugar.

       " 'WTO Appellate Body Grants US Victory in Vietnam Shrimp Duties Appeal Bridges 16 April 2015 The WTO’s highest court has rejected Vietnam’s claims in its appeal over how the US implements adverse rulings by the global trade body in the area of trade remedies. The issue had been raised in the context of a previous panel ruling concerning US antidumping measures on certain frozen warmwater shrimp from the Asian country. The Appellate Body’s report was issued on 7 April, over three  after WTO dispute settlement proceedings first began in February 2012. In its original consultations request, Vietnam had challenged the determination and practices of the US Commerce Department in imposing these antidumping measures, which are meant to counter instances where goods are sold abroad at prices below their normal value. Mixed panel ruling The original case (DS429) had brought back to the fore the often controversial US practice of zeroing, which has been the subject of numerous WTO disputes that Washington has repeatedly lost. Zeroing is a method of calculating antidumping duties, which involves ignoring certain data when calculating them. Specifically, it “zeroes out,” or ignores, instances where the good in question is actually being sold at a higher price in the US than in its home market. Along with challenging the use of zeroing in this case, another issue raised in Hanoi’s original 2012 complaint included Washington’s decision to assign a rate to an “NMEwide entity” comprised of producers/exporters that do not demonstrate sufficient independence from government control. NME refers to nonmarket economies. The panel granted Vietnam a mixed victory in both of those aspects last November, which the country did not appeal. However, Hanoi did challenge the panel’s finding regarding a specific element of US law, namely Section 129(c)(1) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which establishes a mechanism regarding the implementation of adverse recommendations and rulings by the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) concerning trade remedies, such as antidumping duty actions. The panel had found that this US law was not inconsistent with global trade rules, which Hanoi then asked the Appellate Body to reconsider. WTO compliance The provision of the US law at issue addresses the question of when revised trade remedy determinations – meant to comply with WTO dispute panel or Appellate Body findings – take effect. The law provides that Section 129 determinations apply to imports recorded on or after the date when the US Trade Representative (USTR) directs the Commerce Department to take compliance actions. Vietnam had claimed before the panel that this law was inconsistent “as such” with the WTO’s Antidumping Agreement, since it precluded US authorities from implementing DSB recommendations with respect to “prior unliquidated entries” – in other words, those imports made prior to the revised determinations that remained unliquidated. Washington operates a retrospective system for assessing antidumping duties. Following findings of dumping and domestic injury, importers are requested to put aside cash deposits at rates equal to the calculated dumping margins for future imports. On an annual basis, interested parties may request US authorities to conduct an administrative review of their imports at the end of that particular . In these reviews, the Commerce Department recalculates import dumping margins. These new margins are based on actual imports during the 12month period reviewed and become the “final” duty rate for those imports. At the time of the panel proceedings, the US agency had completed seven administrative reviews in which it had calculated the total amount of duties owed for imports during each review period. Vietnam argued that some of these entries remained unliquidated. The US had argued that Section 129 is not the only way of implementing DSB recommendations and that Washington has in the past assessed and liquidated prior unliquidated entries in a manner consistent with WTO rules by using other mechanisms. The panel found that Vietnam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) precluded extending the benefits of implementation to prior unliquidated entries, and therefore Vietnam had not established that this law was inconsistent \"as such\" with WTO rules. Objective assessment The Appellate Body rejected Vietnam’s claim that the panel acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU, which provides that a dispute panel should make an objective assessment of the matter at hand. Hanoi had taken issue with the panel’s finding that Vietnam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) precludes “extending the benefits of implementation” to prior unliquidated entries, and therefore deeming that Hanoi had not established the law’s inconsistency “as such” with WTO antidumping rules. According to Vietnam, the panel applied an \"incorrect analytical framework\" on this subject by requiring it to demonstrate that the abovementioned problem is seen in all circumstances. The Appellate Body  that the legal standard involves reviewing whether Vietnam had shown that this provision of US law necessarily operates, at least in certain circumstances, to preclude implementation of DSB recommendations and rulings. Given the evidence examined by the panel, including alternative mechanisms available for “prior liquidated entries” raised by the US, the Appellate Body found that the panel should not be faulted over how it assessed the evidence in making its conclusions. Vietnam also claimed, under the same DSU provision, that the panel failed to conduct a holistic assessment in ascertaining the meaning of Section 129(c)(1). However, the Appellate Body deemed that the panel had properly considered the relevant elements of the US domestic legal system presented by the parties. Within the scope of Vietnam’s appeal, the Appellate Body did not find the US had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations and therefore did not make any new recommendations to the DSB. Washington will, however, need to bring those measures that were found to be WTOillegal by the panel last November into compliance with global trade rules. ICTSD reporting.',\n",
       " \"U.S. Lawmakers Prepared to Fix COOL Rules if WTO Appeal Fails By Bryce Baschuk WTO Reporter, April 17, 2015 April 16 — Senate Agriculture Committee leaders  they stand ready to modify countryoforigin labeling (COOL) regulations—long opposed by Canada and Mexico—if the World Trade Organization releases a ruling, expected in May, that finds them inconsistent with international trade rules. During an April 16 hearing, Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (RKan.) and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow (DMich.) told U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack they would make any required changes to avoid retaliatory trade measures from Canada and Mexico. “COOL isn't nearly as cool as some people thought it would be and the WTO stove is hot,” Roberts  at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. “We stand ready to fix that with regards to a statutory change and we look forward to working with you,” Roberts told Vilsack. “We are going to work through that and work that one out,” Stabenow . May WTO Decision A WTO dispute panel is reviewing the legality of the amended U.S. COOL rules which require meat producers to specify on retail packaging where each animal was born, raised and slaughtered. Mexico and Canada initiated the WTO dispute, saying U.S. COOL rules cost their pork and beef industries $1 billion per  by imposing undue burdens and costs in violation of WTO rules. The WTO ruled against the U.S. in two previous decisions, declaring the rules do not adhere to the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. U.S. lawmakers are awaiting the pending compliance panel report—which is expected no later than May 18—to determine whether the rules will need to be fixed in order to avoid retaliatory trade actions (44 WTO, 3/6/15). Canadian officials have  they will target nearly 40 U.S. products—such as beef, pork, poultry, cherries, chocolate and frozen orange juice—if the U.S. fails to comply with the decision. ‘We Can't Fix It.’ Vilsack told lawmakers the USDA had done everything in its power to ensure COOL was compliant with WTO rules. “Absent a winning of an appeal, we are in a situation where there is a conflict between the law and what the WTO says is inappropriate, which creates the opportunity for retaliation,” Vilsack told lawmakers at the hearing. “We just can't fix it. We tried it twice. We can't fix it,” Vilsack . “You all have to fix it by either repealing COOL or modifying COOL to create some kind of more generic label.”\",\n",
       " 'Guatemala Lodges Appeal in Peru Agricultural Duties Case Bridges 16 April 2015 Guatemala formally submitted a notice of appeal earlier this month in its WTO case against Peru’s additional duties on certain agricultural imports (DS457), raising questions over a series of legal findings in last December’s dispute panel ruling. The move came within days of Lima’s submission of its own appeal on the subject. At issue in the dispute is Peru’s Price Range System, or PRS, which determines duties based on a series of factors. These include a reference price that reflects international market prices for a good, as well as a range involving a price ceiling and floor, which is established by international prices over the last 60 months. The duties primarily affect rice, sugar, maize, milk, and certain dairy products. The panel had largely ruled in Guatemala’s favour late last  by finding that those duties constituted “variable import levies” in violation of global trade rules, particularly those outlined under Article 4.2 of the Agreement of Agriculture. (See Bridges Weekly, 4 December 2014) The panel had also ruled against Peru’s claims regarding Guatemala’s alleged violation of its “good faith” obligations by launching a WTO dispute. While the two trading partners had negotiated an FTA that permitted the system of duties used by Peru, that deal is not currently in force. The case has thus drawn wide attention in the trade community, given the growing questions over how obligations taken by WTO members under free trade deals interact with their existing commitments at the global trade body. While these issues were raised in Peru’s appeal notice, the FTA dimension of the dispute is not discussed in Guatemala’s submission. (See Bridges Weekly, 2 April 2015) Minimum import price Despite disagreeing with Lima on the abovementioned points, the panel had also denied Guatemala City’s claim that the additional duties under the PRS constituted a “minimum import price” or a border measure “similar to a minimum import price” within the meaning of the same legal provision – a finding which Guatemala is now challenging in its appeal. First, Guatemala has challenged the legal standard that the panel applied in defining measures that constitute a “minimum import price,” deeming this standard “excessively narrow” as it only includes measures applied with respect to the actual transaction value of each shipment of imports. Furthermore, Guatemala says, the panel did not consider that the PRS’ design, structure, and operation entail an implicit minimum threshold that affords a specific type of protection, one that is not provided by ordinary specific duties. Guatemala also argues that the panel erred in its analysis of whether the measure at issue was “similar to a “minimum import price,” given that the panel applied the same legal standard for both concepts. Based on that interpretation, the panel had found that the measure at issue was not “similar” to a minimum import price, given that the duties system did not prevent imports from entering the Peruvian market at prices under a certain threshold. However, Guatemala holds that the PRS’ setup and operation demonstrates the existence of an “explicit threshold,” namely the floor price itself, as well as an “implicit threshold,” which consists of the lowest transaction of the previous fortnight plus the additional duties generated by the PRS. Under WTO rules, the Appellate Body now has 90 days from the date of appeal to issue its report. While it can review aspects of law – such as legal interpretation – it generally will not interfere with factual findings. ICTSD reporting.',\n",
       " 'China Files WTO Challenge Against EU on Poultry Imports Bridges 16 April 2015 China filed a formal WTO complaint against the EU last week, challenging the measures that resulted from the 28nation bloc’s move in 2006 and again in 2009 to negotiate changes to the tariff concessions listed in its goods schedule involving certain poultry products. Under WTO rules, members are allowed to negotiate modifications to their existing goods schedules, subject to certain requirements that are outlined in Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For instance, these talks must be conducted with any other WTO member that was involved in negotiating the initial concession, along with any other member determined to have “a principal supplying interest,” and be subject to consultation with any member deemed to have a “substantial interest.” The EU ultimately negotiated and reached deals with Brazil and Thailand on both occasions, with the first agreements reached with the countries involved in 2006 and the second time in 2012. The latter changes took effect in March 2013. Brasilia and Bangkok had both been considered to have “a principal or substantial supplying interest” in the products that would be affected by the changes in Brussels’ schedule. As Beijing was not deemed to have a “principal or substantial supplying interest” in the goods under negotiation – given that the “reference period” involved covered the time in which the EU restricted imports of poultry from China due to concerns over avian flu – it was not involved in the negotiation or consultation process, which is among the several criticisms listed in the Asian country’s request for consultations. China also says that the resulting deals the EU reached in both 2006 and 2012 did not maintain a “general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions no less favourable to trade” than those existing prior to the changes, as required by Article XXVIII, according to a copy of the consultations request seen by Bridges. Resulting quotas discriminatory, China says Along with criticising the negotiating and consultation procedure itself, China has also challenged the outcome of the EU’s talks with Brazil and Thailand, which it claims led to Brussels assigning tariffrate quotas that are “almost entirely or even entirely reserved” for Brasilia and Bangkok, as well as outofquota rates “significantly” above the bound rates prior to the changes. Specifically, Beijing has cited a serious of provisions under the GATT’s Article XIII, which deals with the nondiscriminatory administration of quantitative restrictions. For example, China says that the countryspecific tariffrate quotas that the EU agreed with Brazil and Thailand give the latter two countries an advantage in market access that discriminates against fellow WTO members. Furthermore, China claims, the level of quota given to Brazil and Thailand violates the WTO provision that requires aiming for a “distribution of trade in such product approaching as closely as possible the shares which the various contracting parties might be expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.” Chen Fuli, Deputy Director of the Department of Treaty and Law in China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), told CCTV that the Asian country’s products “make up over 25 percent of the EU’s imports,” arguing that it is “unfair” that China is allocated only four percent of the quota. Under WTO rules, the two sides must now hold consultations for a minimum period of 60 days in an effort to reach a mutually agreed solution. Should these talks fail to produce such an outcome, China can then ask the global trade body to establish a panel to hear the complaint. ICTSD reporting',\n",
       " 'US lawmakers agree on wording of bill key to Pacific trade deal By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) Senior U.S. lawmakers reached agreement on Thursday on the wording of a bill aimed at giving the White House \"fast track\" authority to negotiate a Pacific trade pact that is central to President Barack Obama strategic shift toward Asia. The agreement, over six months in the making, sets the stage for a bruising legislative battle over Obama proposed TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and similar trade deals, with many Democrats opposed to the legislation along with a small but vocal contingent of Republicans. The TPP, a potential legacydefining achievement for Obama, would connect a dozen economies by cutting trade barriers and harmonizing standards covering twofifths of the world economy and a third of global trade. The bill gives lawmakers the right to set negotiating objectives, but would restrict them to a yesorno vote on trade deals such as the TPP. The Obama administration announced in late 2009 that it was entering TPP negotiations with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Japan, Washington key partner in the trade pact, was cautiously optimistic after the agreement. \"You can say that we have just cleared one obstacle to TPP negotiations,\" Japanese Economics Minister Akira Amari  in Tokyo on Friday. \"Japan is holding workinglevel talks with the United States today. Depending on how that goes, I want to decide today whether or not we can proceed to more formal ministerlevel talks.\" The U.S. Trade Representative has called TPP the \"cornerstone\" of Obama AsiaPacific economic policy. It also is  to U.S. manufacturers and farmers eager to expand already significant sales to the region by winning lower tariffs and other breaks. \"This is a smart, bipartisan compromise that will help move America forward,\" Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  after leaders of Congress taxwriting committees reached agreement on the legislation, which will be introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives. U.S. labor unions that are active supporters of Democratic politicians fear the deal will favor big U.S. corporations at the expense of American jobs and tougher foreign safety and environmental standards. While trade associations and companies such as Intel Corp , Emerson Electric Co and Microsoft Corp welcomed the move, unions immediately announced a new advertising campaign to pressure lawmakers. Similar arguments raged in the runup to the 1993 congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Twentytwo  later there is still a debate over that deal, which badly split the Democratic Party and was passed in the House of Representatives by a narrow 234200 vote. AGREEMENT The Obama administration has faced pressure to make progress on the bill ahead of a meeting between Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on April 28 in Washington. The United States and Japan are the two biggest economies among the TPP countries and an agreement between them is central to the pact. Japanese officials have  success in the TPP negotiations depends on whether the U.S. Congress approves fasttrack measures to ease passage of trade deals, or trade promotion authority (TPA). Japan and other TPP countries have  fasttrack authority would give trading partners certainty that agreements will not be picked apart. TPP must pass Congress this  to avoid being bogged down in the runup to the 2016 U.S. elections where it could put Hillary Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, in a difficult spot. As a former member of the Obama administration, she needs to walk a tightrope between supporting her former boss and warning of the need for tougher trade deals. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, oversaw passage of the NAFTA deal that many unions loathe. The deal between Hatch and the panel top Democrat, Ron Wyden, to move Trade Promotion Authority ahead in tandem with a bill to extend support for workers hurt by trade is no guarantee the legislation will pass Congress. Opponents are lobbying hard to defeat it and many Democrats are still undecided. The bill also faces opposition from some conservative Republicans opposed to delegating power to the White House. \"You bring up TPA in the House today, the best you would have is a handful of Democrats,\" Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives committee responsible for trade,  at a Bloomberg conference. Still, 11 members of the New Democrat Coalition, seen as the most likely source of potential Democratic support,  the package included several of their priorities and they would work with colleagues to make the bill as strong as possible. Chuck Schumer, tipped to become the Senate Democratic leader after the 2016 elections, told a committee hearing he opposes TPA. He and other Senate Finance Committee Democrats  it is not fair to rush such an  issue.',\n",

The 2010 reforms, a doubling of IMF funding and a reallocation of voting power to boost China and other upandcoming economic powers, were originally propelled by Washington, and the President Barack Obama White House has repeatedly endorsed them. But the US Congress has refused to sign off on the deal, with some legislators not wanting to contribute more money to the IMF and others concerned about any erosion to the dominant US role at the fund. Criticisms of Washington have steadily grown, and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde  Thursday that she understood why other IMF members \"are frustrated and impatient to see that reform actually implemented.\" \"I am also calling on the United States to actually obtain ratification of that reform so that the institution can continue to be representative of the entire community as it evolves.\" The G24 endorsed the \"Plan B\" put forward in recent weeks to split the the two facets of the 2010 reforms and put through the quota revision without the need for ratification by the US Congress. The net effect of that reform would be to reduce the voting power of European countries while increasing that of China, India and others. END',\n",

Economics Minister Akira Amari formal talks with his U.S. counterpart depend on progress of workinglevel meetings aimed at narrowing gaps over the agricultural and auto sectors. Amari comments followed the submission of a bill to the U.S. Congress that would give President Barack Obama the authority to negotiate the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Passage of the bill, which Japan sees as crucial for success in the TPP talks, is far from assured. \"You can say that we have just cleared one obstacle to TPP negotiations,\" Amari . \"Japan is holding workinglevel talks with the United States today. Depending on how those go, I want to decide today whether or not we can proceed to more formal ministerlevel talks,\" Amari , adding that a timeframe for his decision has not been set. The United States and Japan, the biggest and thirdbiggest economies, account for about 80 percent of the economic output of the 12member TPP, making them the pacesetters of the multilateral trade talks. The bilateral talks have been stymied by Japan efforts to protect politically powerful agriculture sectors such as beef, and disputes over both countries\\' auto markets. Washington and Tokyo see strategic value to a broad TPP deal as forming a counterweight to rising China, which has not joined the group. Japanese media  the two countries were aiming for meetings between Amari and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman on Sunday and Monday, depending on the outcome of the ongoing talks between U.S. Acting Deputy Trade Representative Wendy Cutler and Japan deputy chief trade negotiator, Hiroshi Oe. Neither Japan nor the United States confirmed the report. \"There are still issues to be solved. We will do the utmost so that a parliament resolution (to protect five agricultural products) can be seen to be kept,\"  Agriculture Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi. \"Ministerial meetings could bring about good results only if workinglevel negotiations make enough progress.\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to meet Obama in Washington on April 28 for a summit that will also focus on security issues.

       " 'China Says to Accelerate Reforms to Support Yuan in IMF Currency BasketXinhua By REUTERS APRIL 18, 2015, 3:23 A.M. E.D.T. SHANGHAI — China central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan  Beijing would accelerate reforms to the country currency to push for the yuan inclusion in the International Monetary Fund currency basket, known as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday. Zhou made the comments during an interview with Xinhua reporters in Washington, D.C. on Friday, where he was attending a meeting of the IMF. China has committed to further open its capital account and liberalise the way the exchange rate is managed, including reducing intervention in the domestic currency market, which would alleviate concerns among IMF members that incorporating the currency would increase liquidity and policy risks in the SDR regime.',\n",
       " 'Russia economy shrinks 24% despite Putin positive spin Kathrin Hille and John Thornhill in Moscow April 17, 2015 5:55 pm Financial Times Russia economy contracted further in the first quarter triggering a 5 per cent slide in the rouble, a day after president Vladimir Putin sought to reassure the nation that the worst of the crisis was over. Monthly statistics published on Friday showed that consumers turned even more bearish in March despite the currency recent stabilisation, and economists estimated that gross domestic product was likely to have shrunk by between 2 and 4 per cent in the first quarter. The figures came a day after Mr Putin spent the first hour of a marathon televised callin show to reassure citizens over the state of the economy. \"Nothing has failed and everything is working,\" he . \"We have passed the peak of our problems\". Members of Mr Putin economic policy team have been talking up the economy for several weeks as the Russian currency has rebounded. \"Overall, the situation is not bad,\" Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister, told the Financial Times this week. The rouble lost more than half of its value against the dollar last  against the backdrop of intensifying international sanctions over Russia intervention in Ukraine, and plummeting oil prices. It weakened to 51.68 to the dollar on Thursday, down 3.5 per cent on the day, but still up from 68 to the dollar at its low point in December. Mr Dvorkovich  that while western sanctions were making it more difficult for Russian companies to raise external financing, they were adapting and cutting costs. The government, he , expected GDP to fall by no more than 3 per cent this  and grow between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent next . Others paint a bleaker outlook. Alexei Kudrin, the former finance minister, told the FT last weekend that he expected GDP to drop 4 per cent this  and to continue contracting in 2016. His forecast is based on the assumption that investment will drop by up to 12 per cent and real incomes by up to 6 per cent this . \"It is a fully pessimistic forecast. It is not a catastrophe. But it is a contraction and a recession,\" Mr Kudrin . chart In March, investment dropped 5.3 per cent compared with the same month last . Industrial production contracted 0.6 per cent, sustained by the food and chemical industry gaining market share after Russia restricted western imports. But the main downward pressure comes from consumers, who helped sustain growth last . In March, retail sales contracted 8.7 per cent. The official consumer sentiment index in the first quarter plummeted 14 percentage points compared with the previous quarter — its worst since the last financial crisis in early 2009. This comes despite unemployment being far lower than during the last crisis. \"Last time we started with about 7 per cent, and it went up to 9.5 per cent; this time we started with 5 per cent,\" Mr Dvorkovich . \"And we have the financial capacity to support people who need it.\" Chart Consumers\\' main concern is inflation, which soared following the rouble depreciation, and the embargo Russia imposed on western food imports last . Mr Dvorkovich argued that although inflation was \"a heavy burden, [consumers] can sustain this for a few months, until the situation is better\". This week, inflation slowed for the first time since the start of the food embargo, bringing the annualised rate to 16.8 per cent. But analysts believe it will be several more months until the economy turns a corner. \"The second quarter or the third quarter, depending on this  harvest, could be the bottom,\"  Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial, the Moscow brokerage. He estimates that GDP contracted about 2 per cent in the first quarter.',\n",
       " 'South Korea A Changing Market for Rice? 17 April 2015 TheCropSite News Desk SOUTH KOREA and US South Korea is a small, but highvalue market for the US rice industry. The US exports have averaged more than 104,000 MT of rice to Korea annually over the past six  representing about 25 per cent of the roughly 410,000 MT imported by volume, or 26 per cent of imports by value. However, a shift may be coming. While Korea continues to purchase US rice, officials are attempting to manage rice supplies that exceed domestic demand. In 2013, Korea rice harvest produced a nearly 200,000 ton surplus. In reaction, the Korean agriculture ministry is looking west to tap into China rice market. In order to boost shipments to China, the South Korean government must lift restrictions that inhibit the volume and price of rice exports. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture has just published an exporters\\' handbook containing key information about prominent buyers in crucial importing countries as a means of assisting Korea export market to countries like China. In addition, last , Korea announced that it was shifting to rice tarrification, eliminating the countryspecific quota the US and others utilized. The United States, and several other countries, have objected to Korea version of rice tariffication in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and those complaints remain outstanding, meaning that Korea current rice import regime has yet to be officially approved by the WTO. \"We\\'re active with promotion efforts in Korea because there is demand for high quality US rice, but we do have potential market access problems as a result of tariffication, which began in January,\" explained Jim Guinn, USA Rice vice president of international promotion. \"We are urging the US to engage with Korea to address our concerns, and the fact that Korea is now looking to increase exports, clearly indicate this is a challenging market. We\\'ll continue to monitor the situation.\"',\n",
       " 'Democrats\\' civil war over free trade The open infighting ramped up after a breakthrough on the historic bill was announced. By Adam Behsudi POLITICO The most  trade bill in a decade has pitted Harry Reid against President Barack Obama. Liberal Democrat Rosa DeLauro against moderate Democrat Ron Kind. Labor unions against probusiness Democrats. And Elizabeth Warren against virtually everyone who supports a landmark piece of legislation that would allow the president to close what could be the biggest freetrade deal in history. The open warring among Democrats over fasttrack trade legislation, and the party broader existential crisis on free trade, grew more pronounced Thursday as senior lawmakers announced a breakthrough on the trade bill. Many Democrats still feel the burn, 20  later, of lost manufacturing jobs from the North American Free Trade Agreement — pushed through by former President Bill Clinton — and they fear another Democratic president is on the verge of turning his back on workingclass Americans by negotiating a trade deal that would send jobs overseas. What at stake substantively is giving the president streamlined authority to negotiate the TransPacific Partnership, a 12country freetrade deal that would dwarf NAFTA. But there also much more at stake politically for a Democratic Party whose progressive wing is enjoying an upswing thanks to the aggressive populism of Warren and liberals like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who are unabashedly antifree trade deal. Obama wants to cement a legacy on global free trade, but his work negotiating with Republicans has created several factions within the Democratic Party. Take Kind and DeLauro. Both Democrats come to the fasttrack debate from opposite sides. Kind, a Wisconsin lawmaker who joined the tradefriendly New Democrat Coalition, has provided solid support for the White House, boosting its message that the TPP, which includes enhanced labor and environment protections, isn\\'t reminiscent of the trade policy of  past. DeLauro, from Connecticut, has been a central figure in the fight against the bill, forming a powerful progressive coalition of labor, environment, social justice and religious groups that argue any improvements are window dressing at best. \"The single biggest economic issue facing American families is that jobs do not pay enough to live on,\" she  following the Trade Promotion Authority bill introduction on Thursday. \"Fast tracking the TPP would make it easier for corporations to offshore Americans jobs and force our workers to compete with those in Vietnam making less than 60 cents an hour.\" While the New Dems on Thursday  they were still studying the legislation, they were encouraged by the inclusion of provisions to protect workers and renew trade preference programs. Kind has yet to issue a formal statement, but in January, the Wisconsin lawmaker talked favorably about fast track. \"You can complain about [the fasttrack bill] all you want, but if you allow a Republican Congress to amend and change [future trade deals] you\\'re going to end up in a worse position than what you started with,\" Kind . \"It doesn\\'t make sense for a Democratic member to oppose it.\" The internal Democratic wars are spilling into the presidential campaign as well, putting Hillary Clinton on the spot. Clinton has been reluctant to show her hand on the pending trade legislation, although she voiced support for the massive AsiaPacific pact that the administration is negotiating while serving as Obama secretary of state. When running against Obama for president in 2008, she instead  the U.S. needed to take a \"timeout\" on trade. Other potential Democratic candidates, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O\\'Malley, have assumed the progressive populist mantle and are already positioning themselves to Clinton left by preemptively coming out against the TPP. Unlike Clinton, Warren has been unequivocal in her opposition to fasttrack authority and the Asia trade deal, and that one of the reasons some antitrade liberals keep pushing her to get in the presidential race, though she continues to say she is not interested. Warren declared herself all in on the battle against fast track and the TPP deal at a rally on Wednesday. \"We\\'re here today to fight,\" the Massachusetts Democrat , whipping up a crowd of about 1,200 people in a park facing the Capitol Building. \"We are here to fight. Are you ready to fight?\" Most other Democrats in Congress, too, are skeptical of Obama freetrade agenda and are expected to vote against the trade promotion authority legislation, which will fast track trade deals through Congress by limiting amendments and subjecting the agreements to upordown votes. The trade promotion authority bill introduced Thursday puts Obama and others who support the measure where they were a little more than a  ago when Reid stopped the legislation dead in its tracks. The Senate Democratic leader has never liked the legislation, voting against it in 1997 and 2002. This time, however, the GOP controls the Senate. Past trade deals \"haven\\'t always lived up to their promise,\" Obama  in a statement issued Thursday, echoing a comment he made in his State of the Union address. But he asserted that he would only sign his name to an agreement that \"helps ordinary Americans get ahead.\" \"The bill put forward today would help us write those rules in a way that avoids the mistakes from our past, seize opportunities for our future, and stay true to our values,\" Obama . In the Senate, where Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, wants a vote by late April, the fasttrack trade bill will need six Democrats to support it to get to the 60vote filibusterbreaking threshold. However, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (DN.Y.) protested plans to rush to a vote. \"Not fair and not adequate on such an  issue,\" the Senate thirdranking Democrat told Chairman Orrin Hatch. \"Not fair. Not fair. And you are a fairminded man.\" In the House, Republicans want a vote before the current legislative session breaks for the Memorial Day recess, Rep. Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican,  Thursday. The tally is expected to be close. As few as 10 House Democrats, primarily from the ranks of the businessfriendly New Democrat Coalition, are firmly committed to supporting the legislation. The measure needs 218 votes to pass in the lower chamber, which means getting the yeas of anywhere from 10 to 50 Democrats, depending on how many of the 247 Republicans in the House vote against the trade bill. Estimates of Republican defections vary widely from two dozen to as many as 60. \"What I can tell you, which is good news, is a lot of members are feeling the heat,\" Sanders  Wednesday night to constituents belonging to the liberal group Democracy for America. \"Whether we can beat it in the Senate or not, I don\\'t know. I think we have a better shot frankly in the House where to the best of my knowledge the overwhelming majority of Democrats are against it,\" the Vermont independent . \"We don\\'t know how many tea party Republicans will not want to give the president this authority,\"  Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat. \"You see on some of the negotiations with Iran, they want a heavy amount of oversight they want to watch every move that he makes … if that same group applies that same standard to this trade agreement there may be some backlash with us in the House not having the ability to amend it.\" Ryan, who represents a manufacturingheavy district in the state northeast, is among those vocally opposing the bill. But he  there are still a lot of maybes out there in the caucus. \"They\\'ve been fairly quiet and I think they want to see how it plays out with fast track and they obviously want to see the agreement too,\" he . \"There a lot of unknowns out there for a Democrat to get out in front and say I\\'m definitely voting for this.\" Despite an impressive coalition aimed at defeating the deal, the number of Democrats who support the bill could grow depending on the position of leadership. But so far, there is little indication that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi or Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer will support the legislation. Pelosi has offered a consistent message that Democrats want a \"path to yes.\" She has even organized a series of briefings on the AsiaPacific trade deal to help members be able to make a more educated decision, but — based on her past record — she is not expected to support a fasttrack bill. She took a firm stance against last  TPA bill, saying it was \"unacceptable. Hoyer, who has been supportive of past trade deals, struck an unusually cautious tone about the legislation when asked about it earlier this week. \"It very controversial over here, as you well know,\" he . Hoyer didn\\'t outright oppose a fast track bill last  and  he was \"keeping his powder dry\" on the issue. The top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Sander Levin, has come out against the bill. Levin has pushed for Congress to resolve outstanding issues in the AsiaPacific pact before voting to give the president negotiating authority. The fasttrack compromise \"gives up Congressional leverage at the exact wrong time,\" the Michigan lawmaker  in a statement. \"Instead of pressing USTR to get a better agreement or signaling to our negotiating partners that Congress will only accept a strong agreement, the HatchWydenRyan TPA puts Congress in the back seat and greases the skids for an upordown vote after the fact.\"',\n",

The report, released recently in Geneva, shows that UAE ranks 16th among global exporters and is the number one market for merchandise exports in the Mena region. In imports, UAE ranks 19th and is the most  market for merchandise imports in Mena. The WTO report says UAE merchandise exports reached $359 billion (Dh1.3 trillion), which is 1.9 per cent of the total world exports. UAE imports grew by 4 per cent and it accounted for 1.4 per cent of the total world exports. Regionally, UAE accounts for 28 per cent of the Middle East merchandise exports and 33 per cent of imports during 2014. According to the report, UAE ranks 19th among global importers of services. The total value services imports to UAE is $2 billion, which constitutes 1.5 per cent of the total global imports of services. However, this rank goes up to 13 when the EU is considered as a single bloc. The UAE exports of services increased to $17 billion, ranking 25 globally, if the EU is considered a bloc. \"The UAE has become a major player in international trade,\"  Economy Minister Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri. \"Our country bolstered its position in the global trade scene and we expect it will continue to do so for the coming . The trade policy of the UAE, advanced infrastructure, strategic location and legislative environment are all factors contributing to the continuous growth of our trade sector.

       " 'Sagging global trade will throttle India ambitious export targets The Times of India & The Economic Times Blogs By Pyaralal Raghavan 19 April 2015 India ambitious plans to boost exports of goods and services to $ 900 billion by 201920 seems to have suddenly run into major hurdles with the dynamics of global trade changing substantially in recent . This is brought out in the latest global trade estimates of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which points out that the synergy between growth in global merchandize trade and global output seems to have suddenly ebbed sharply in recent .This is in sharp contrast to the global experience in the last few decades during which growth of trade has generally outstripped economic growth. In fact numbers for almost a quarter of the century between 1990 and 2014 shows that while global real GDP growth averaged around 2.5% annually during the period volume of global merchandize trade surged at double the pace at around 5%. However, this two to one relationship that existed between growth of global trade and global output has been suddenly broken down in recent . In fact figures show that the pace of expansion of global trade and global output has remained the same in the last three  up to 2014. Explanations for the new phenomenon are many and include new protectionist measures enforced by governments in response to slowing growth and adverse macroeconomic conditions.Trade experts point out that the new trend is not surprising and that at least some indicators pointed to the break in strong links between global trade and output. This is best brought about by the numbers on income elasticity of world trade, which is the ratio of world trade growth to world GDP growth, which peaked at around 2.2 sometime in the nineties, much before the global financial crisis, and fallen steadily since then to 1.4 in the more recent . Another explanation is that global trade takes some time to gain traction after an economic shock as was witnessed after the oil shocks in the midseventies and early eighties. Whatever be the actual reasons the base message is that growth of global trade has been badly hit by structural and cyclical factors and that it would be only reasonable that countries like India to bank too much on the expanding goods export to pay for the growing imports or to balance its current account. And the trends in the growth of India exports in the last few  reinforces this view. Though India goods exports have shot up by double the pace of global exports in the last decade the trends has suddenly been reversed in the recent . Thus while value of global goods exports grew at an annual average rate of 7% during the 200514 period India exports surged by an average annual rate of 14%.But the trends has suddenly been overturned both in 2012 and 2014. While growth of value of goods exported globally remained stagnant in 2012 India exports fell by 2%. In 2014 growth of value of global and India exports stagnated at around 1%. Only in 2013 did India good exports do substantially better than the global trends. The worst part is that this new phenomenon on the goods exports seems to have affected services exports too which is generally identified as the most buoyant segment of the India economy. Thus we find that though the 13% growth in India services exports was almost double that of the 7% growth in global exports the scenario has changed substantially in recent .For instance in 2012 the gap between growth of services exports from India and the global average narrowed to 5% and 3% respectfully. In 2102 the 2% growth in services exports from India was less than half the global average of 5%. And the most recent figure for 2014 shows that growth of India and global exports of services remained almost stagnant at 1%.This sudden slowdown in growth of India exports of goods and services are warning signals that India policy makers would do well to incorporate in the decisions when they embark on implementing grand strategies on boosting manufacturing or exporting skilled labour to meet global needs. This also means that global trade scenario is changing fast and it would certainly be difficult for India or any other country to emulate the Chinese export based growth model that worked well in another time and era.',\n",
       " 'Eliminate barriers to trade with India 12:00 AM, April 19, 2015 The Daily Star CPD calls for an agreement so that Bangladesh and India accept each other standardisation certification Bangladesh should sign a bilateral agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures with India so that the countries accept each other standardisation certification, the Centre for Policy Dialogue  yesterday. The call came as the South Asian economic giant has become a major market of Bangladeshi agricultural products. SPS measures deal with food safety and animal and plant health. They aim to ensure that a country consumers are being supplied with food that is safe to eat by acceptable standards while also ensuring that strict health and safety regulations are not being used as an excuse to shield domestic producers from competition. \"I think Bangladesh has a lot of opportunities to export agriproducts to India. The government can sign a bilateral agreement with India for resolving the SPS problems,\"  Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the CPD. He called for signing the agreement as the South Asian Regional Standards Organisation (SARSO), a common certification panel for the Saarc region, is yet to be fully effective though it started journey in April 2014. Of Bangladesh total exports to India, 20 percent are garments and the rest are others, especially agriproducts, he . \"We should deepen trade relations with India to exploit the trade opportunity in the agriculture sector,\" he . At the same time, the government should improve the capacity of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), Rahman . He was speaking at a seminar on \"nontariff barriers in BangladeshIndia trade: addressing SPS issues and concerns\" at Brac Centre Inn in Dhaka. Mahbubur Rahman, president of International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh, chaired the event. \"We were supposed to be the best friend of India for having commonalities in culture, lifestyle and food habit, but unfortunately we are not,\"  M Anis Ud Dowla, chairman of ACI Ltd, a local company that has business with India. He  seed export to India requires quarantine test, which is done in India, and Bangladeshi exporters need to wait for four weeks to receive certificates. \"By this time the season ends and Bangladesh cannot export seeds to India.\" He  both the governments should sit together to resolve the certification issues politically. Syed Humayun Kabir, director general of SARSO,  common standards for two items biscuit and refined sugar have been set so far for all Saarc nations. \"Thirty more items are in the process for getting common standards,\" Kabir . Sometimes trade barriers arise due to a lack of awareness of rules and regulations,  Mostafa Abid Khan, director of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute. Zillul Hye Razi, trade adviser to the European Union delegation in Bangladesh,  a lack of managerial capacity often leads to such barriers. Tanveer Islam, general manager (export) of Pran Group, which has been facing SPSrelated problems for exporting its products to India,  Bangladeshi exporters need to wait for approvals from the Central Food Laboratory (CFL) of India. India has specific packaging requirements, which is another barrier, he , adding that all food samples need to be sent to Kolkata as CFL facilities are not available near all land ports. Khaleda Akhter, senior research associate of the CPD,  bilateral trade between Bangladesh and India has been on the rise. Bangladesh exports to India increased to $456 million in fiscal 201314 from $144 million in 200405.

This was announced by the Minister of Industry and Trade, Vu Huy Hoang, at a conference held in Ha Noi on Thursday. Hoang  the FTA between Viet Nam and the EU was likely to be inked in June, while the agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan might fructify at the end of May or in June at the latest. Viet Nam and the RoK intend to sign a trade agreement on May 5. Negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement are also expected to conclude by the end of this , the minister , adding that his ministry was preparing to begin negotiations on another FTA with Israel. Speaking at the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh, who is also the Head of the Intersector Steering Committee for Economic International Integration, requested ministries and sectors involved to speed up the integration process. He also pointed out several shortcomings, including weak coordination in the steering committee and between relevant offices, ineffective communication, and a lack of activity among enterprises and localities. The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Quoc Khanh, who is also the Government delegation head and incharge of economic and trade agreement negotiations,  differences in the ministry point of view on several specific issues would hinder the negotiation process. Delegates to the conference suggested renewing communication activities by directly disseminating the effects of economic integration in each sector and on each product to local people and enterprises. Opportunities Vietnamese enterprises need to work together to seize opportunities and overcome challenges that will arise from existing and future free trade agreements, economic experts  at a conference held in HCM City yesterday. Viet Nam has signed and is negotiating several free trade agreements, including the TransPacific Partnership, EUViet Nam FTA and Viet NamKorea FTA, which will bring great opportunities for domestic firms but more challenges, according to senior economist Le Dang Doanh. The EUViet Nam FTA, which is expected to sign this , will help increase Viet Nam exports to the EU bloc by 3040 per cent. Exports of many kinds of Vietnamese goods, particularly textiles and garments, are expected to see a strong increase after the TPP is signed. \"But opportunities will not come automatically,\" he noted. Businesses must be more proactive in taking advantage of lower tariffs and take part in the value chain of companies involved in TPP, he . But the higher requirements related to product origin, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, environmental protection and others under the TPP will be challenges for local firms, according to the economist. In addition, technical barriers to trade on labels, packages, chemical residue and legality of materials will pose other challenges. Local pig, pork and beef industries, most of which have smallscale production, will find it difficult competing with other TPP countries. Regarding the ASEAN Economic Community, Doanh  it would usher in free movement of goods, services and skilled labour, as well as a freer flow of capital. The reduction of tariffs on goods among ASEAN members would enable Vietnamese firms to boost exports as well as participate in the global production chain, he . But on the other hand, they would also face fierce competition in both domestic and international markets. To become stronger, he urged local firms to join a consortium and establish production chains that involve enterprises, farmers, banks and research institutes. Firms should also focus on investing in human resources and technology, and use IT in their operations. Luong Van Tu, former head of the Viet Nam WTO negotiation team and chairman of the Viet Nam Coffee and Cocoa Association,  TPP would offer both opportunities and challenges for local firms, requiring the latter to enhance cooperation and use each other products. Many foreign investors had increased investment in Viet Nam to take advantage of changes brought from TPP, he .

       " 'Lost in Europe VAT Maze A yesterday tax stifles tomorrow online commerce. Attempts to simplify the valueadded tax for intraEU trade is only making things more complex. April 16, 2015 7:17 p.m. ET The Wall Street Journal About the only good thing in the new plan from Brussels to boost online commerce is a pledge to try to simplify valueaddedtax rules for intraEU trade. Too bad this reform remains a distant prospect. In its discussion plan for the Digital Single Market unveiled last month, the European Commission noted that \"the cost and complexity of having to deal with foreign tax rules are a major problem for [small companies],\" and it pegged annual VAT compliance costs at €80 billion. Compliance is especially burdensome for smaller firms that must cope with up to 28 different VAT regimes in the European Union. Consider a small firm in Italy selling a product to customers in France, Spain and Romania. Figuring out to whom to pay VAT is the first challenge. If the Italian firm sells only a few products outside Italy, it will pay VAT to Rome. But if its sales to another country exceed a threshold, the Italian company has to register to pay VAT in the destination country. That threshold is different everywhere. The Italian could sell products worth €100,000 in France each  before having to pay French VAT, but sales above €35,000 require payment of Spanish VAT, while in Romania the limit is 118,000 Romanian leu (€27,000). Then a business needs to determine how much VAT to pay. Standard rates range from a low of 17% in Luxembourg to a high of 27% in Hungary, and each government exempts or reduces rates on different products. If the Italian company sells books, it will owe reduced rates of 4% in Spain and 9% in Romania. It will pay a reduced rate of 5.5% for books shipped to France—but starting next , it will owe the full VAT of 20% on any books it sells in electronic form. If a German machinetool firm is lucky, its customer in Britain will be a company with its own UK VAT registration, which will pay VAT on the purchase. But if the German company stores parts on consignment in a British warehouse to be closer to the customer, who pays and how much will depend on how much \"control\" each party has over the merchandise in storage. And good luck figuring out your VAT liability if Company A in Portugal, Company B in Poland and Company C in Denmark engage in a quickfire chain transaction. Recent attempts to solve these problems have made matters worse. In January the EU introduced a \"onestop shop\" facility to allow companies selling online products such as music downloads to file a single VAT return to their own country tax authority, which would then distribute the tax payments to other governments. Brussels will start discussing a similar rule for the sale of physical goods next . But this measure eliminated smallbusiness thresholds and imposed VAT based on the residence of the buyer rather than the seller. Tens of thousands of small businesses have gotten trapped in the VAT maze for the first time as a result. One lesson is that governments are hungrier for revenue than they are for crossborder trade, which helps explain why ecommerce struggles in the EU. But this is also a broader morality tale about consumption taxes, which are often and wrongly billed as simple to administer and easy to comply with. VATs are equal to personal and corporate income taxes in their failure to keep up with increasingly mobile people, goods and capital. Europe VAT maze is only one egregious example of a yesterday tax stifling tomorrow growth.',\n",
       " 'Sagging global trade will throttle India ambitious export targets Pyaralal Raghavan 20 April 2015 The Times of India & The Economic Times Blogs India ambitious plans to boost exports of goods and services to $ 900 billion by 201920 seems to have suddenly run into major hurdles with the dynamics of global trade changing substantially in recent . This is brought out in the latest global trade estimates of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which points out that the synergy between growth in global merchandize trade and global output seems to have suddenly ebbed sharply in recent .This is in sharp contrast to the global experience in the last few decades during which growth of trade has generally outstripped economic growth. In fact numbers for almost a quarter of the century between 1990 and 2014 shows that while global real GDP growth averaged around 2.5% annually during the period volume of global merchandize trade surged at double the pace at around 5%. However, this two to one relationship that existed between growth of global trade and global output has been suddenly broken down in recent . In fact figures show that the pace of expansion of global trade and global output has remained the same in the last three  up to 2014. Explanations for the new phenomenon are many and include new protectionist measures enforced by governments in response to slowing growth and adverse macroeconomic conditions.Trade experts point out that the new trend is not surprising and that at least some indicators pointed to the break in strong links between global trade and output. This is best brought about by the numbers on income elasticity of world trade, which is the ratio of world trade growth to world GDP growth, which peaked at around 2.2 sometime in the nineties, much before the global financial crisis, and fallen steadily since then to 1.4 in the more recent . Another explanation is that global trade takes some time to gain traction after an economic shock as was witnessed after the oil shocks in the midseventies and early eighties. Whatever be the actual reasons the base message is that growth of global trade has been badly hit by structural and cyclical factors and that it would be only reasonable that countries like India to bank too much on the expanding goods export to pay for the growing imports or to balance its current account. And the trends in the growth of India exports in the last few  reinforces this view. Though India goods exports have shot up by double the pace of global exports in the last decade the trends has suddenly been reversed in the recent . Thus while value of global goods exports grew at an annual average rate of 7% during the 200514 period India exports surged by an average annual rate of 14%.But the trends has suddenly been overturned both in 2012 and 2014. While growth of value of goods exported globally remained stagnant in 2012 India exports fell by 2%. In 2014 growth of value of global and India exports stagnated at around 1%. Only in 2013 did India good exports do substantially better than the global trends. The worst part is that this new phenomenon on the goods exports seems to have affected services exports too which is generally identified as the most buoyant segment of the India economy. Thus we find that though the 13% growth in India services exports was almost double that of the 7% growth in global exports the scenario has changed substantially in recent .For instance in 2012 the gap between growth of services exports from India and the global average narrowed to 5% and 3% respectfully. In 2102 the 2% growth in services exports from India was less than half the global average of 5%. And the most recent figure for 2014 shows that growth of India and global exports of services remained almost stagnant at 1%.This sudden slowdown in growth of India exports of goods and services are warning signals that India policy makers would do well to incorporate in the decisions when they embark on implementing grand strategies on boosting manufacturing or exporting skilled labour to meet global needs. This also means that global trade scenario is changing fast and it would certainly be difficult for India or any other country to emulate the Chinese export based growth model that worked well in another time and era.

       " 'India exporters need more policy support Ritesh Kumar Singh 20 April 2015 Business Line (The Hindu) The recent foreign trade policy has some positives. However, inverted duty structure is a cause for bother Indias Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 201520 sets an ambitious target of $900 billion in merchandise and services export by 2020. Which means, exports of goods and services must grow at CAGR of over 15 per cent in the next five  to double from its current levels of $ 450 billion. The new FTP seems to be guided by the following considerations: keeping tabs on how much money goes out on account of export incentives given the fiscal constraints; WTO obligations to phase out export subsidies; linking the FTP to the Make in India initiative; and improving FTAs utilisation in trade. Thus, the number of countries covered under the new merchandise export from India scheme (MEIS) that replaces five existing incentive schemes, including FPS and FMS, has been pruned to a keep a tab on fiscal outgo. The quantum of export subsidies is lower than earlier. Reduction of export obligation by 25 per cent under the EPCG (export promotion capital goods) scheme is expected to boost indigenous production of capital goods. The introduction of online filing of documents is to reduce trade transaction cost and help manufacturing exports by increasing their cost competitiveness. Merchandise falling under the categories of handloom products, books/periodicals, leather footwear, toys and customised fashion garments, with fob values of up to Rs. 25,000/consignment and their sale finalised through ecommerce, would get the benefit of FTP. Advantages and limitations The exports from SEZs suffering from high MAT would now be eligible for incentives. Another notable positive is the introduction of transferability of duty free scrips and allowing them for payment of customs, excise duties and service tax without any conditionality. However, it would be worth examining how effective the new FTP would be in pushing Indias merchandise exports. It is very difficult to decode what forms the basis of categorising Indias export destinations into three groupings as well as allocation of MEIS rates for different commodities. What could explain the exclusion of countries such as Brazil, Bangladesh and China for export promotion with respect to top textile products? Again, increasing exports to China should have been top priority, but there is no real incentive for China in the new FTP even though it is a top export destination for cotton fibre and yarn. From a strict reading of the FTP, only direct export to Japan and the US should be eligible for MEIS. The problem is India mostly exports fabrics to Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam for conversion into garments that are ultimately shipped to Japan and the US. It is worth mentioning that some of Indias well intentioned trade policy actions (to help LDCs like Bangladesh), though outside the purview of the FTP, are hurting indigenous manufacturing. For instance, allowing duty free, quota free import of garments from Bangladesh (or Myanmar) without imposing sourcing obligations promotes the backdoor entry of Chinese textile material into India, and hurts the whole textile value chain in the country from fibre to yarn, fabrics and apparel. Sourcing blues The FTP needs to follow up with other actions like making the use of fibres, yarns and fabrics of India origin mandatory for allowing duty free imports of apparel from Bangladesh and other LDCs seeking preferential market access on nonreciprocal basis. Its not that India would be the first country to impose sourcing restrictions for allowing duty free imports of apparels. The US imposes sourcing restrictions in all its existing and proposed trade pacts. Why cant India? Because of Indias FTAs and other trade deals such as Information Technology Agreement (ITA), Indias manufacturing sector has to suffer what is called inverted duty structure, that is, high import duties on inputs/ raw materials and lower duties on finished goods. Thus, one can import an apparel item duty free in India but its basic raw materials are subject to 5 to 10 per cent import duties. The last Union Budget did attempt to address some of the cases of inverted duties, but only partially. Again, increasing the use of FTAs would require addressing nontariff barriers in partner countries. For instance, Japan, as per the terms of the IndiaJapan CEPA, allows duty free import of apparels from India only if all the material used for the manufacture of apparels are either of India or Japanese origin. India businesses should realise that the days of export subsidies are numbered because of WTO obligations. To deal with slowing demand and rising cost on a longterm basis, businesses must develop suitable global strategies for sourcing, production and trade.

A ministry statement  Egypt would also impose a 20 percent tariff on white sugar for 200 days, following a filing to the World Trade Organization last week in which it sought to safeguard domestic producers from a damaging surge in imports. The tariffs come at a critical time for Egypt steel industry, which is recovering from four  of political and economic turmoil, and for a global market struggling with low prices and overcapacity due to lacklustre demand. Egyptian steel companies have been further pressured by energy costs and availability in a country where energy shortages have hit output and profitability. The country produces six to seven million tonnes of reinforced steel a . Egypt major steelmakers had petitioned the government to impose antidumping measures on rebar and wire rod imports from China, Ukraine and Turkey after energy subsidies were cut last summer. The ministry statement  the steel tariffs would be at least 408 Egyptian pounds ($53.5) per tonne in the first , dropping annually to 175 pounds in the third . A ministry official told Reuters the tariffs on steel imports would begin on May 2 and those on sugar would start once a notice is published in the official gazette. Temporary \"safeguard tariffs\" are allowed under WTO rules if there is a sudden, unexpected and damaging surge of imports, and if the country that imposes the tariffs first seeks the views of interested parties. The ministry statement  a minimum tariff of 700 Egyptian pounds per tonne would be imposed on white sugar while the government investigates an influx of imports in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. \"This fierce attack of white sugar imports came as a result of a drop in global prices which has not happened in more than 20 ,\" the statement , adding that the surge in imports had already cost Egyptian industry about 1 billion pounds.

Why is Kyiv not fulfilling the \"Normandy four\" accords? \"Poroshenko breached virtually everything he agreed\" in Minsk, Stephen Lendman writes on thepeoplesvoice.org, and he suggest this is connected to \"orders from Washington.\" Yet the United States\\' ultimate goals have not yet been completely revealed. It continues to dictate the line of conduct not only to Ukraine but also to the European Union. The United States is not stopped either by accusations of interference in allEuropean politics or by the reputation, melting away before our eyes, of the leaders of the two leading EU states who took part in the conclusion of the Minsk agreements. It is hard to avoid the feeling that the continuation of the bloodshed in the Donets Basin [Donbas, Donbass] is needed by the United States in order to achieve something of importance to itself. Yes, access to the resources of Eurasia via the Ukrainian \"window\" and the deployment of new military bases there form part of US plans. But, recalling how shamelessly the United States pressured the EU over antiRussian sanctions and how it is \"steamrollering\" them on the issue of arms deliveries to Kyiv, you understand that they are playing for time for a good reason. America needs the protracted sanctions epic, in violation of international law, and the atmosphere of information hysteria in order to continue its unpunished economic robbery. Its ultimate goal is certainly not a bright allEuropean future for Ukrainian citizens but the conclusion of a harsh and overarching economic agreement with the EU in which Europe appears to have been assigned the role of junior partner. In addition to the NAFTA Treaty (between the United States, Mexico, and Canada) which has already been in operation for two decades, a further two major draft agreements are now being strenuously promoted with the EU on Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and on TransPacific Partnership (TTP [as published, should be TPP] with 12 states of the region. What is bad about this? Any power wants to have new markets and as many trading partners as possible. But they do not like posting any information about the agreements under preparation and it is no accident that 1 million Europeans have signed a petition against TTIP. Only under pressure from the European public (over a  after the approval of the relevant European Commission mandate) was there any success in getting even some details of the behind the scenes transAtlantic talks. A  ago the talks revealed serious differences between the sides. Now they are talking of their intention to reach agreement by the end of 2015, although it is hard to list all the areas of conflict. But the most dangerous thing is falling into the trap of new restrictions which would be very tough for the Europeans. And also a substantial reduction to the role of the WTO: It is hard to imagine \"the peaceful coexistence\" of several large trade associations which will account for a substantial proportion of world GDP. Not only in Europe and the AsiaPacific region states but also in the United States, the two projects are being subjected to considerable criticism. In the first instance justified fears are being voiced for the fate of entire segments of national economies which will go under to more powerful US sectors. In the latter instance the objections (in Congress) are of a more political nature. But should we doubt the United States\\' ability rapidly to pressure partners to make the decision it wants? For instance, for the US presidential elections which will take place in 2016. As a result of the opening of the two new zones, the WTO could be hostage to secretly developed trade and investment rules. This could lead to profound crisis. Including in political relations between countries and continents on which standards of economic relations which no one has discussed with them will be imposed as a new model. We know from history the sorry consequences to which the desire of individual powers to reallocate the planet economic wealth and to \"rework the world\" to their own ideas can lead. Yet those ambitions did not grow out of nowhere their roots were laid down back in colonial times. And if it seems to anyone that the last \"squabbles\" between the former colonial powers ended centuries ago that is not the case. Military invasions of various parts of the world are quite often dictated even now by the desire to establish control over a particular part of the globe. At one time this was called \"neocolonialism\" and now it is called \"hegemonism\" or, which sounds better, \"leadership.\" That does not change the essence. Of course it is far simpler to take away than to create something new. It is easier to steal than to earn. It is cheaper to feed an army than an entire people and with the army aid to win lands rich in other people oil, gas, and other resources. And to turn a devastated country soaked in blood into a new rawmaterial or industrial appendage. But this is medieval barbarity, whatever the rhetoric of enforced democracy or information screen accompanying it. The ever new conflicts in various parts of the world arising sometimes because of external acts of provocation show that the colonialists\\' instincts have not gone away. They are being manifested with new force in some political adventurists from Europe, while they have become the essence of its geopolitical strategy for the United States. The obedience of almost all Europe has already been achieved in military matters and much is also under control in political issues. Now it is the turn of trade and finance. From this we citizens of the European states must draw practical conclusions  for a new amalgamation of forces for a just world order based on the law. And our Ukrainian brothers must start to think about the true role assigned to their country by the transAtlantic \"director.\" After all, for that \"director\" the tragedy of their Motherland is not even a secondary role, it is a mere episode. And the number of victims is of no importance here.

       " 'Nepal: Subsidise our farmers BIJENDRA MAN SHAKYA 19 April 2015 The Katmandu Post Nepal, April 19 An abrupt rise in Nepal food imports in recent  has drawn much media attention and the publicity has aroused the interest of the general public. Food imports (cereals and live animals as defined under the harmonized system of product category of the customs) have jumped from Rs24 billion in 200910 to Rs88 billion in 201314. This represents a massive leap of 266 percent in the past five fiscal . On average, the annual growth rate was more than 30 percent in the review period. In contrast, exports of the same food category increased from Rs13 billion to Rs21 billion during the same period, an increase of only 64 percent. Exports of food items could not climb above the annual average rate of 10 percent in the last five . This simple trade data illustrates how domestic food production has been lagging behind increased domestic demand leading to a growing dependency on food imports. Ultimately, this has resulted in a massive deficit in the country food trade balance. Net food importer These indicators have revealed Nepal, despite being an agricultural economy, is turning into a net food importing country. There are two basic reasons commonly referred to behind this phenomenon. One, there has been a growing shortage of farm labourers to produce enough food in the country due to the increased outflow of our manpower to overseas countries attracted by a relatively better pay abroad. Two, the overflow of cheap and subsidized food imports in the country has outcompeted domestic production. But why the fuss as long as we can feed our people by importing cheap food from the remittance sent back by our labour force working abroad or through any other net foreign exchange incomes in the balance of payments? Yes, in the short run, there is no reason to worry about it. But in the long run, the problem of food security emerges. This is why many countries, irrespective of their economic development, subsidise farm production and protect it from external competition. Forget about some developing countries like India and Brazil which are striving hard to subsidize their farming with the view of maintaining food security. The farm subsidies provided in the world richest and industrialized countries, specifically the EU and the US, are astonishingly high. The developed countries have been accused of spending $1 billion a day in farm subsidies and outpricing the developing countries in the international market. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has estimated that farmers in the West received more than $300 billion a  which was six times the assistance provided by the rich countries to the poor countries. Subsiding subsidies The EU common agriculture policy (CAP) provides another example of farm subsidies. About half of the farm income in the EU countries comes directly from this programme. Ascribed to productionbased subsidies, European countries were  to have produced a \"lake of wine\" and a \"mountain of butter\". At the same time, the tariffs imposed on agricultural imports in the rich countries are unbearably high. They have not lived up to their promise to cut farm tariffs and provide easier market access to the farm exports of the developing countries. Instead, the rich countries have succeeded in protecting their farm sector by increasing subsides and maintaining relatively higher tariffs despite WTO negotiations to liberalize the farm sector. These persistent practices have made agriculture one of the most contentious issues in the global scenario. For a least developed country like Nepal, these international developments have provoked much thinking. While subsidies are central to food security and farm trade in most of the developing and developed countries, they are virtually nonexistent in Nepal. For many  in the past, farm subsidies were considered to be a violation of international norms as if they mattered to only a poor country like Nepal. Lack of funds with the government has also been cited for its being unable to finance subsidies. Food security Considering the current international situation, Nepal cannot go against food subsidies because it is a net food importing country. Imports of subsidised and lowpriced foods have maintained total consumer welfare. At the same time, if we are to ensure food security and promote agro exports, the country agricultural sector has to have solid government support. So the country needs a comprehensive farm subsidy programme that increases the output and lowers the unit price so that imports can be easily substituted and food security can be ensured. In the same manner, subsidies on farm exports will allow Nepali exporters to effortlessly outprice competitors in the rich country markets as Nepal enjoys dutyfree access in these countries which have high tariff walls in agriculture.

The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) foresees the creation of the world largest free trade zone by pulling the 28nation EU and the US more closely together.

Malstrom noted that issues on the negotiators\\' agenda this week included regulatory cooperation, and rules on competition, stateowned enterprises, energy, raw materials and sustainable development, among others. While the industry has by and large spoken out in favor of the proposed deal, the TTIP has also long drawn significant criticism from both sides of the Atlantic. Consumer groups lament that the freetrade deal would lead to a dilution of regulatory standards and oversight. Germany is home to some of the staunchest opponents of the pact, with studies pointing out that the majority of Germans are against TTIP. On April 18, thousands of protestors took to the streets in Europe to oppose the proposed agreement. The most controversial aspect of the pact includes clauses related to investor protection.

As the ninth round of negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) kicked off in New York, the European Commission published an indepth survey of SME attitudes to TTIP, the latest attempt by the EU to highlight the benefits of a deal facing significant public opposition in some member states. Almost 900 companies from 25 member states were surveyed. The report found trade with the US is already an  source of business, with SMEs responsible for 28 per cent of direct exports to the US from Europe, equating to approximately €77 billion. The value of exports sold by Irish SMEs to the US in 2012 was €7.3 billion, the study found. Launching the report in Brussels, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström  the EU was committed to securing an agreement that was \"ambitious, comprehensive and will maintain our highest levels of standards\". The report had also highlighted the significant challenges faced by SMEs in accessing the US market, with respondents citing regulation as one of the key barriers. \"The regulatory part of TTIP is very much a small business agenda. Big companies can deal with that. They have whole departments to deal with this, but small family companies do not have the resource to do these double testing, double inspections, and that is why it so  to unlock the economic benefits of these deals for them.\" This week negotiations in New York are expected to focus on regulation. While supporters of TTIP believe streamlining of regulatory standards between the US and the EU will significantly reduce red tape and costs, antiTTIP campaigners have warned of a fall in consumer standards. The Swedish commissioner also confirmed she would come forward with a revised proposal for an InvestorState Dispute Settlement mechanism in the coming weeks.

In a transcript of his address made available to PANA in New York, the UN chief stressed the need for identifying and tackling the root causes of high youth unemployment which he  was widespread in many countries. He  that policy measures are needed to increase formal employment and close the gender gap in labour markets in order to enhance gender equality and empowerment. Ban disclosed that the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in July, would provide a chance to devise a new international financial framework for sustainable and inclusive development. He  three outcomes should be sought in that conference, \"the first being a cohesive and holistic financing framework for sustainable development.\" \"Second, concrete deliverables, particularly in crucial areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, social needs, and support for small and mediumsized enterprises, and third, a strong followup process to ensure that no country is left behind. \"But, this followup needs to be based on technical expertise and the participation of the institutional stakeholders gathered here today,\" the secretarygeneral stated. He  that a stable, inclusive economy is necessary, but not sufficient for sustainable development, stressing the need to ensure the availability of the required resources for sustainable development at all levels, both national, international, public and private. 0 PANA AA/AR 20April2015 Panafrican News Agency',\n",
       " 'India proposal on lowincome farmers faces opposition at WTO D Ravi Kanth 21 April 2015 Geneva, April 21 The US, the European Union (EU), Canada and Australia have opposed a proposal from India and other developing countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) that seeks policy space to support lowincome farmers through a permanent solution for public stockholding programmes for food security. WTO members are required to come up with a permanent solution by the end of this . Initial positions adopted by major industrialized and a few developing countries such as Pakistan, Paraguay and Thailand indicate that such a solution is not likely to materialize,  several trade envoys familiar with a closeddoor meeting held last Friday. The chair for Doha agriculture negotiations, John Adank, convened the meeting to discuss new rules that would increase the policy space for the permanent solution for public stockholding programmes for food security. India trade envoy Anjali Prasad made a strong case as to why the policy space is needed through a permanent solution for public stockholding programmes. She  public distribution system (PDS) programmes feed hundreds of millions of people in developing and the poorest countries. India expressed concern over the repeated attempts by some countries to take the negotiations for the permanent solution backwards by raising extraneous issues. The market price support (MPS) that sustains public procurement programmes is an \"incentive\" to farmers to continue cultivation, and every member present in the room is providing MPS, India . After twoandahalf  of intense negotiations on the need for a permanent solution due to the existing structural anomalies in the WTO agreement on agriculture, the US, the EU, Canada and Australia are adopting an evasive strategy for denying a permanent solution,  a former trade envoy familiar with the negotiations. The US, for example, told the meeting on Friday that it lacks the understanding of the nature of the problem concerning public stockholding programmes for food security. Washington wants to know how the existing agreement on agriculture does not allow policy space for developing and poorest countries. It emphatically called for open markets and food security for all. The EU, which supported the US at the meeting,  it will not agree to include public stockholding programmes in the greenbox subsidies that are currently exempt from reduction commitments. Canada maintained that the purchases for public stockholding are meant to address hunger of the producers and the distribution of PDS stocks will lead to export surges and import substitution. Australia  what India and other Group of 33 (G33) countries are asking for is more policy space for tradedistorting farm support. Last , the G33 group of developing nations presented a detailed proposal on how to arrive at a permanent solution for public stockholding programmes for food security by making credible changes to the WTO agreement on agriculture. The G33 gave three options to address the problem. First, adding a new paragraph to include market price support for food security in the socalled greenbox disciplines of the agreement on agriculture that are exempted from any subsidy reduction commitments. Second, modifying the existing rules to ensure that the acquisition of food stocks by developing countries to support lowincome and resourcepoor farmers is not required to be calculated under the current method of calculating aggregate measurement of support (AMS, or tradedistorting farm subsidies). And third, modifying or amending the rules to calculate subsidies based on the socalled external reference period of 198688 prices, which was decided during the previous Uruguay Round of negotiations. The 2008 revised draft modalities prepared by the former chair for Doha agriculture negotiations, Crawford Falconer of New Zealand, had proposed the requisite changes to ensure that \"there is no requirement for difference between the acquisition price and the external reference price to be accounted for in the AMS\". Indonesia, which is the coordinator for the G33, told the US that its proposal goes \"beyond the mandate to find a \"permanent solution\" for public stockholding programmes for food security purposes. The US proposal underscored the need to review \"the efficacy and trade effects of the existing public stockholding programmes for food security policies\", \"to review the existing WTO rules and policies adopted by members and how these policies are constrained by those rules\", and finally to establish \"best practices for capacity building to implement the agreed best practices\". Criticizing the US proposal, Indonesia  the G33 \"would like to make it clear that we tabled the proposal not because we have limited capacities to adopt best practices in this area but, rather, because we need some policy space to effectively support lowincome or resource poor farmers, to fight hunger and rural poverty\".

       " 'American barriers mean Europe still waits for its ship to come in Alexandra Frean 21 April 2015 The Times \"Faced with a shortage of seagoing vessels during and after the First World War, the United States did what many countries do when their backs are to the wall — it passed protectionist legislation of truly spectacular proportions. The 1920 Jones Act requires that all goods transported by water between US ports be carried on USflagged ships, constructed in the US and owned and crewed by US citizens. In a bizarre twist, that 95old law has become a key bargaining chip in one of the world largest trade accords and it could affect the price you pay for the Florida orange juice on your breakfast table. The Jones Act has been highly effective in shielding American shipping businesses from foreign competition, which is why it is so popular with shippers and trade unions. The Transportation Institute, a Washingtonbased maritime lobby group, credits it with supporting 73,787 American jobs, plus another 425,889 from indirect and induced employment. Yet it has also produced some odd incentives, making it necessary for Florida to import coal from Colombia instead of American mines or for Maryland and Virginia to bring in road salt from Chile rather than Ohio, according to the nonprofitable Capital Research Centre. And considering that the world top ten shipbuilders are based in Japan, South Korea and China, you have to wonder how well the Jones Act mission of protecting the nation shipbuilding industry is working for America. In addition, the law is unpopular with free trade advocates, who quite rightly complain that it increases the price of goods to American consumers, particularly those living in offshore states and territories such Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam. And it is heartily disliked by John Cridland, directorgeneral of the CBI in Britain. \"Why,\" he asks, \"shouldn\\'t a British or Frenchbadged ship have the same rights as an American ship?\" He has a point. Under the Jones Act, if a British, French or Germanflagged ship bringing imports to New York from Europe wants to load up in, say, Boston for the return journey across the Atlantic, it cannot ship anything on the New YorktoBoston leg. At present, Mr Cridland is busy talking about the Jones Act to any American who will listen. He regards it as central to the potentially worldchanging negotiations taking place on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, known as TTIP, which aims to open up trade between the European Union and the United States by removing tariffs and reducing regulatory barriers. The governments in both London and Washington are pushing for completion of the TTIP, which will create a single market of 800 million consumers, boosting trade and jobs. From the EU point of view, repealing the Jones Act seems like a nobrainer. So does removing US restrictions on airline ownership (US rules restrict foreign ownership of airlines to 25 per cent, which is why Sir Richard Branson is only a minority owner of Virgin America). Europe has a long list of similar grievances with, in its opinion, simple solutions. But when Mr Cridland raises the Jones Act with American lawmakers or officials, they mostly accuse him of tilting at windmills. As the talks have proceeded, other seemingly intractable obstacles have emerged. Early on, the US Treasury voiced opposition to harmonising financial regulations, suggesting that the fate of the hardwon Dodd Frank financial reforms should \"not be handed over to trade negotiators\". There have been huge disagreements, too, on the issue of public procurement, including fears in Britain of American companies taking hold of NHS services. Nobody holds out any hope of making all car indicators orange — they are red in the US — or of banning growth hormones from American beef. Instead, the idea of harmonising regulations has been replaced with the principle of mutual recognition of each other standards. These largely theoretically debates have moved one step closer to reality, however. Last week, in an unlikely alliance between the president and free trade Republicans, senators agreed the wording of a Trade Promotion Authority bill that would give politicians the power to \"fast track\" trade deals by allowing Congress to approve or reject, but not alter, any treaty. If Congress passes this, America can start to finalise the TransPacific Partnership, an equally ambitious tree trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim countries, not including China, that is ahead of the TTIP on President Obama todo list. Despite this apparent progress, the TPP and the TTIP face huge opposition in the United States, particularly from the labour unions (who also happen to be leading backers of the Democratic Party), conservation groups and the progressive wing of Congress. Interestingly, Hillary Clinton gave a guarded response last week when a deal on the TPA bill was struck by senators, insisting that \"trade for trade sake\" should not take precedent over workers\\' rights. All of which brings us back to the Jones Act. The likelihood of America repealing it or watering it down seem, if anything, to be receding. When the subject of TTIP was first raised in the summer of 2013, governments on both sides of the Atlantic promised to do wrap it all up within 18 months. \"It was all going to be done on \\'one tank of gas\\' and it was going to be really big,\" one senior official familiar with the talks says. \"No one thinks that now. If it does happen, we may have to settle for something much less than we would have liked.\" Alexandra Frean is US Business Editor of The Times News UK & Ireland Limited',\n",
       " 'Q&A: Japan Abe Discusses Trade Deal, Deflation By WSJ Staff 21 April 2015 Dow Jones Newswires Chinese (English) In an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  Japan and the U.S. are near an agreement on a transPacific trade deal. Mr. Abe also  that while he can\\'t guarantee deflation won\\'t return, Japan isn\\'t experiencing it right now and he trusts Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda to use the right policies to reach the central bank inflation goal. Here are some of the questions and answers: Are you expecting that you will be able to announce anything that might be the basis for an agreement or any kind of effort on the [TransPacific Partnership] when you meet with [President Obama] next week? Mr. [Michael] Froman is currently in Japan, and he is negotiating with Mr. [Akira] Amari, the minister in charge. We think that an agreement between Japan and the U.S. is close, but we\\'re hoping that even more progress will be made. Of course, I think it would be good if I could reach an agreement during my meeting with the president, but when you climb a mountain, the last step is always the hardest. That means, whether we reach an agreement by the time of the meeting or not, I want to make sure we are on the same page, that the TPP is extremely beneficial for both countries fundamentally. I also want to make sure we are on the same page that we will approve the TPP with the leadership of both the U.S. and Japan. What is the last hurdle? Is the problem just cars and agriculture, or is there something else? Fundamentally, for the U.S. it cars, and for Japan it agriculture. In terms of these, both countries have their own sensitivities. I think ultimately what needs to happen is for both countries to make a decision, using political judgment, with the benefits of the TPP in mind and with the understanding that it is extremely  to make a free economic zone in the AsiaPacific region where people, things and money can freely move about in secure routes. The president, as you know, faces domestic opposition to getting [Trade Promotion Authority], or \"fast track\" authority. Obviously it would be helpful to him if he could demonstrate to Congress that there is a deal. Are you willing to help him as he tries to get that political impetus behind support for trade in the United States? About the [Trade Promotion Authority], up until now, many members of Congress, from both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the U.S., have come to Japan. I have heard from them how they consider the TPA to be . That is very reassuring to hear. But nevertheless, it does concern the relationship between Congress and the U.S. president, and for Japan and the U.S., from the perspective from which I spoke, I think it is  for both countries to make a decision in either case. Since Abenomics started two  ago, you have  yourself prime minister that the biggest aim was to end deflation, to end the deflation that gripped Japan for many long . BOJ Governor Kuroda has  that there is an extremely high risk that Japan will slip back into deflation, based on the fact that price growth recently is zero. Based on that, do you think that Abenomics has ended in failure? In these two , GPD has grown 1.5% in real terms and 3.7% in nominal terms. The jobstoapplicants ratio is at the highest in 22 , the job market is tight and wages are rising the most in 15 . This  wages look likely to rise even more than that. Of course, due to the fall in oil prices, the consumerprice index is now in the kind of situation you described in your question. But I think we succeeded in getting rid of people deflationary mindset using the policy of the three arrows, with unprecedented monetary easing at the very beginning. It true that last , as a result of raising the sales tax by 3%, consumer sentiment temporarily cooled, and that the rise in wages did not catch up with the rise in prices, including the salestax increase. However, I think the rise in wages since this April has fully outweighed the rise in prices. Deflation continued for 15 , and I can\\'t say that it ended for good, but we have created a situation where there is no longer deflation. About the sales tax, do you think it wise to determinedly go ahead with a 2% rise in two . We got higher wage rises this April than we did last . I think that should spread to small and mediumsized companies in May and June. Company profits in [fiscal] 2013 were a record Yen60 trillion, and they are on track to be even larger in [fiscal] 2014. I think we can create a situation whereby wages can likely rise again next . Honestly, I think I can make a situation where wages can even rise the  after that. In other words, I am confident that we can create a situation where we can raise the sales tax by 2% [in April 2017]. In fiscal 2015, growth is projected to be 1.5%. The [International Monetary Fund] and the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] are upgrading their forecasts, and I think that we can increase tax revenue and get the economy growing with even more efforts such as regulatory reform. With CPI growth at zero currently, Mr. [Koichi] Hamada and Mr. [Etsuro] Honda have  that even if the inflation rate doesn\\'t reach 2%, if growth continues, it okay. Do you agree? I think Mr. Hamada and Mr. Honda are talking about what the goal is. Exiting deflation and setting the 2% pricestability target is a goal of making the economy steadily and healthily grow, and for people to get wealthier  after . I think they are saying that it is simply a goal, and 2% is simply a means. About the accord between the Bank of Japan and the government on the 2% goal, the fall in oil prices was not in the forecasts two  ago. It was not a factor. In that sense, I want to recognize Mr. Kuroda efforts, and I trust him to make the right monetary policy towards the 2% goal. Dow Jones Newswires',\n",

       " 'Modernizing the WTO By Alex Manson 21 April 2015 The Wall Street Journal Asia Global trade isn\\'t what it used to be, and neither is the World Trade Organization. As the WTO marks its 20th anniversary this , it has to adapt if it wants to stay relevant. We\\'re all familiar with goods labeled \"Made in China\" or \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" but today supply chains overwhelmingly cross borders. Goods are now \"Made in the world\" trade is no longer about one country manufacturing a product and exporting it to another. Instead we have complex global supply chains with many different markets collaborating together. Emerging markets in particular are at the forefront of driving world trade. Bilateralism and multilateralism are making way for plurilateralism, where small groups of nations set up mutually beneficial trade policy based on shared interests. The world regional agreements like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are already driving new patterns of trade. Other agreements are likely to continue that trend, with groups like the East African Community demonstrating how the potential of intraAfrica trade could be greater than that between Africa and the rest of world. Corporate supply chains are also changing, with small and mediumsize enterprises collectively playing a far bigger role in global value chains previously only associated with multinational companies. One result: Tariffs, the traditional preoccupation of the WTO, are hardly the only barriers to trade that need to be identified and eliminated. Smaller companies can\\'t typically deal with the complexity of local regulations such as consumerprotection laws. The emergence of \"private standards\" market requirements set by the private sector targeting, for example, food safety or environmental impact are also an issue. Financing is equally critical: Small and midsize firms need working capital but they also rely on banks to provide trade finance in cases where exporters and importers don\\'t know each other yet require timely payments, risk mitigation or seamless transfer of information. Trade finance, where banks confirm or discount letters of credit or finance trade receivables, also requires linking financial institutions in emerging markets to the global financial system. However, as wellintended antimoneylaundering and knowyourcustomer regulations are implemented across the banking industry, we are seeing an increasing number of trade and correspondent banks exit emerging markets. Recent surveys by the Asian Development Bank and the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade suggest a correlation between compliance requirements and such retrenchment. This leads to higher costs of financing for small and midsize firms and could even cause financial exclusion in certain markets the opposite of what is needed for global trade to flourish. Even more worrying is the strong correlation between a squeeze on the availability of trade financing and a drop in output and job creation. ADB studies indicate that a 25% increase in trade finance would result in a 33% increase in production and a 22% increase in jobs, while a 25% reduction in trade finance would result in a 12% reduction in production and 9% in jobs. Such a drastic drop in trade and activity would have enormous implications for global growth. Trade agreements can play a crucial part in making sure that doesn\\'t happen. While it is difficult to predict the feasibility of broad multilateral agreements, more countries could join plurilateral agreements. The pending Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the U.S. and the European Union could be extended to more countries, such as parts of Africa. China, the central player in many global supply chains, has expressed interest in joining negotiations for the 12nation TransPacific Partnership. Such accords, once settled, could become starting points for global trade deals. Advocacy is also part of the job. Most people now understand and accept the benefits of free trade. As old barriers have come down, however, new local regulations have appeared. For the WTO to continue to boost trade, it needs to broaden its scope to address not only tariffs and trade facilitation as remains the focus in the Bali package but also the other areas that impede trade. From advising emerging regional trade blocs to prevent the formation of \"trade islands,\" to harmonizing regulations to reduce trade costs and turnaround times, the WTO can play a vital role in supporting emerging countries\\' integration into the global trade system. As for the advocacy realm, it needs to gather the broad political support necessary for preventing new barriers from emerging. Trade is changing. It time for the WTO to catch up.

       " 'Modi visits to France, Germany and Canada adapt lessons learnt from China economic miracle 21 April 2015 The Economic Times By: Manoj Joshi Being his own best publicist, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had indicated just what would be the tenor of his transatlantic tour in a tweet on March 26th: \"My France, Germany & Canada visit is centred around supporting India economic agenda & creating jobs for our youth.\" In the age of AsiaPacific, a focus on the Atlantic may appear a tad anachronistic. But Modi is, if anything, innovative when it comes to foreign policy. Note, a planned trip to the UK was postponed till after the May 2015 general elections there. At an overall level the visits complete the set of tours to advanced democracies of the world – the US, Japan, Australia and now France, Germany and Canada. They address the Modi government approach to a constituency which is at the heart of modern finance and industry – though they could well be called postindustrial cultures today. The goal is to showcase the Modi government sense of purpose and determination to drive a transformational agenda in the country, as well as to create a network of strategic allies which can be of use in dealing with India difficult neighbours, Pakistan and China. Given the economic thrust, it was not surprising that meetings with CEOs, participation in industrial fairs, visits to industrial and skilling institutions featured prominently in the agenda. The companies of countries like France, Germany and Canada set standards around the world. Travelling to China last week this writer saw control equipment, spectrometers, assay machines, DNA profiling and genomic measurement equipment built in France and Germany dotting the labs of the hightech industry zone in Xian, as well as the physical presence of small, medium and large European and North American companies so  for the Chinese economic miracle. But there are other aspects to Modi transatlantic tour as well. First, the connect with the diaspora, especially the  one in Canada. It formed part of a pattern that has been visible in Modi visits to the US and Australia, more cautiously in Fiji, and more assertively in Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Second, the visits should be seen in the context of the importance of summitry in modern international relations. Dealing directly with heads of government is a far quicker way of getting business done these days. So the quality time that François Hollande, Angela Merkel and Stephen Harper made for Modi is  in an age when leaders meet each other frequently and you tend to get lost in the crowd in  multilateral summits if you don\\'t establish a modicum of personal chemistry through bilateral contact. With the US president being given special authority to finish negotiating the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), we are probably on the verge of a new world trading environment with negative implications for India. The US and Canada are part of TPP, whose finalisation will undoubtedly give an impetus to a parallel Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between EU and the US. In such circumstances, we will need all the friends we can manage in pushing our trade and investment promotion agenda. The third aspect relates to India strategic goals. France has a permanent membership in the UN Security Council and both French and German companies play a role in India defence industry. France has been a friend in need, disinclined to use embargoes to push its foreign policy goals. There are also some common themes in the visits. One is that of energy and space technology cooperation. Both Canada and France are  nuclear technology players. Canada was the first to help India with pressurised heavy water reactors in the 1950s and 1960s and it can offer more by way of upgrading and modernising this technology. A new pact with Canada will lead to the supply of uranium for the India nuclear industry. Canada is a special case when it comes to energy, given its own innovative oil and gas industry which can help India diversify its sources of supply. Vocational education and skilling are another aspect of what advanced countries can offer India. Our current education system is at a dead end and the Modi plan for making India a global manufacturing hub rests vitally on the creation of trained manpower that can drive the Make in India dream. Germany is a leader here, but both Canada and France have their own unique systems and experiences. A new theme relates to security. Developed democracies are now facing the prospect of a new kind of terrorist threat from homegrown religious extremists. In an era where terrorists get radicalised by the internet and move effortlessly across borders, cooperation has to be both practical and efficacious. There is, as well, a great deal of expertise in countering cyber threats in all three countries. Recall, in 2009, Canadian researchers revealed the existence of the GhostNet run out of China – which had penetrated Tibetan government in exile as well as India government computers. Modi visits resemble roadshows with their attendant hype, even though they also have a larger strategic purpose. But like all roadshows there is a time for publicity, and a time to get down to work on the MoUs, agreements, promises and commitments.

       " 'Why Obama needs a key tool for trade talks the Monitor Editorial Board 20 April 2015 The Christian Science Monitor America new defense secretary, Ashton Carter, likes to joke that a freetrade pact with Asia would be \"as  to me as another aircraft carrier.\" His larger point is that economic cooperation can be a powerful peacekeeper. It is a good argument to make as Congress weighs passage of a bipartisan bill on trade. The bill would grant special authority to President Obama in negotiating trade deals, notably one now in the works with 11 other Pacific nations and another with the European Union. Any final pact could be subject to only an upordown vote in Congress. This \"take it or leave it\" restraint is crucial to achieving complex compromises in trade negotiations. The bill also sets down minimum requirements on labor rules, environmental standards, and human rights. The economic benefits or drawbacks of free trade to Americans will be hotly debated as President Obama makes a strong push for passage of the measure, known as trade promotion authority. Yet given the world history of war as a means for economic gain, lawmakers should support the expansion of trade competition as a welcome substitute for the violence of war. It is far better that nations compete with economic tools, such as trade rules, loans, credits, or even sanctions than with military weapons. It must also fight the temptation to see prosperity as a limited economic pie. As Harvard scholar Steven Pinker wrote about Europe postwar moves toward trade cooperation: \"Zerosum plunder gave way to positivesum trade. People increasingly controlled their impulses and sought to cooperate with their neighbors.\" Or look at the increasing role of economic sanctions rather than armed conflict such as those used against Russia and Iran for their military aggressiveness. The most likely trade pact to come before Congress soon is the 12 nation TransPacific Partnership. The TPP would define trade rules for 40 percent of the world economy, and that is even without China not yet included in the talks. It would also help give AsiaPacific countries a larger interest in each other security, protect smaller nations from the economic coercion of larger ones, and help cement America future in Asia. As Defense Secretary Carter put it in a recent speech: \"Some people would have you believe that China will displace America in the AsiaPacific, or that its economic growth will somehow squeeze out opportunities for young [Americans]. But I reject the zerosum thinking that China gain is our loss because there another scenario in which everyone wins. And it is a continuation of the decades of peace and stability anchored by a strong American role, in which all AsiaPacific countries continue to rise and prosper, including China.\" He adds that peace and prosperity in Asia will be the coming generation \"central strategic challenge.\" The world longheld hope for peace has relied on finding alternatives to war that allow people to both compete and cooperate, such as in cultural expression, the Olympics, or space exploration. Trade expansion may be the most potent alternative, one far better than building more aircraft carriers. A new bipartisan bill in Congress would give the president special authority to negotiate trade pacts. Such economic measures are a vital means for peaceful cooperation between nations.

       " 'EU to Propose New Rules on Banning Biotech Crops By Matthew Dalton 22 April 2015 Dow Jones Top Global Market Stories BRUSSELSThe European Union is set to propose new rules that would allow individual member states to ban the sale of genetically modified crops for nonscientific reasons, drawing waves of criticism from the bloc trading partners and the food industry on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. and South American nations fear the plan, which would apply to any biotech product sold in the EU, could wreak havoc on agricultural trade with Europe. These nations export billions of dollars of biotech crops to the 28nation bloc every , mainly for use in animal feed. European farm groups are also strongly opposed, as are U.S. biotech giants such as Monsanto Co. The expected proposal is an attempt by JeanClaude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the EU executive arm, to seek a lasting compromise on Europe regulation of biotech crops. The 28nation bloc is bitterly divided on the issue: Some nations such as the Netherlands, the U.K. and Spain support the technology, while France, Austria and others are opposed. The European Parliament and EU national governments must approve the commission proposal before it can become law. The EU trading partners are warning the proposal could run afoul of international trade rules enforced by the World Trade Organization, setting up a confrontation at the Genevabased arbiter of trade disputes. U.S. officials also worry the plan could undermine domestic support in the U.S. for reaching a deal on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, the sweeping trade deal now under negotiation with the EU. Under the plan, which officials say will be unveiled on Wednesday, the commission would promptly approve biotech crops for import after they have been deemed safe by EU scientific authorities. That has been a longstanding gripe from U.S. officials and the biotech industry: Crops that have passed scientific reviews get stuck in Europe regulatory limbo; the commission is reluctant to defy member states that oppose biotechnology by approving the crops, even though it has the legal authority to do so. But the proposal would also allow a member state to ban the use of these crops if it believes there is an \"overriding\" public interest. EU lawyers say this provision, reflecting what is essentially moral opposition to biotechnology in some EU nations, would allow bans under WTO rules, even on biotech crops that have passed safety reviews. \"We have some serious concerns on the potential outcome of such a revision\" to the biotech rules, the ambassadors to the EU from the U.S., Canada, Argentina and Brazil wrote to the commission earlier this month. \"We trust that the commission will ensure that any options under consideration are fully consistent with the EU WTO obligations.\" \"Generally, all roads lead back to the core principle of sound science,\"  Brendan McGivern, a WTO expert at the law firm White & Case in Geneva. EU scientific authorities have repeatedly found that most biotech crops are safe for the environment and for human consumption. But only one variety, a corn engineered by U.S. biotech giant Monsanto Co., is approved to be grown in Europe. The EU earlier this  finalized rules that allow individual nations to ban biotech crops from being grown in the EU, even if they are approved by the commission. Now the EU is going much further in seeking to allow national governments to restrict all uses of the crop on their territories. The EU has approved 58 biotech plants for importing into the bloc as food and animal feed. But 19 that have cleared scientific review are awaiting final approval, after the previous president of the commission, José Manuel Barroso, stopped the approval process so the commission could review Europe rules for regulating biotech crops. The commission will approve those 19 plants for import in the coming weeks as part of its proposal, EU officials . The proposal could have a significant impact on animal farmers in Europe. They rely on soybean animal feed imported from Brazil, the U.S., Argentina and Paraguay, 90% of which are biotech, the commission says.

       " 'U.S. Treasury warns Congress currency push could derail Pacific pact 22 April 2015 Reuters News * Senators plan to push for tough currency rules in trade bill * Treasury says Pacific trading partners oppose enforceable rules * Democrats push back against Republican rush to pass fast track (Adds details on legislation, reaction from senators) By Krista Hughes and Jason Lange WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) U.S. lawmakers\\' proposals to sanction countries that deliberately weaken their currencies could derail a Pacific trade pact that is a key part of the Obama administration pivot to Asia, the Treasury warned on Tuesday. The Senate could vote on a Trade Promotion Authority bill to speed deals through Congress as early as next week, when Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a joint meeting of Congress. Japan is a key partner in the 12nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), and supporters of a deal say that countries negotiating with Washington want to be sure that concessions they make will not unravel during ratification in Congress. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  consultations with other TPP countries showed they would never sign up to rules that risk constraining central banks, whose easy money policies to stimulate growth can help to weaken currencies. \"Seeking enforceable currency provisions would likely derail the conclusion of the TPP given the deep reservations held by our trading partners,\" Lew wrote in a letter to senior lawmakers. The Japanese yen and euro have fallen sharply against the dollar due to moneyprinting programs by their central banks, making companies based there more competitive in exports. An amendment drafted by Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Debbie Stabenow, to be introduced at a Senate Finance Committee debate on a package of trade bills on Wednesday, would beef up rules against currency manipulation. These currently allow the administration discretion on how to get trading partners to toe the line. Trade promotion authority, or TPA, allows Congress to set negotiating objectives for trade in exchange for a yesorno vote. That gives trading partners certainty deals will not be picked apart. \"Without strong currency enforcement, it will not have my vote,\"  Stabenow, whose state of Michigan is home to U.S. auto manufacturers worried about more competition from TPP partner Japan, such as Ford and General Motors. Republican John Thune, a member of the Senate leadership team,  it would be \"perfect timing\" for the fast track bill to go for a full Senate vote during Abe visit. \"You\\'ve got to strike while the iron is hot,\" he . But Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid  he was concerned about the rush on the legislation, which is opposed by many Democrats worried about the impact of trade deals on jobs and faces a close vote in Congress.

       " 'White House wants no currency provision in trade bill 21 April 2015 Agence France Presse US President Barack Obama administration on Tuesday came out strongly against Democratic proposals to curb currency manipulation as part of a sweeping Pacific trade pact Washington is negotiating with 11 nations. While the White House reiterated its support for a recent deal that gives President Barack Obama \"fasttrack\" authority to sign freetrade agreements without interference from Congress, some members of his party seek to attach measures that would add enforceable currency manipulation rules. Such an addition is backed by the largest US labor union organization. But in a letter to senior lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  that while the administration strongly supports steps to end currency manipulation, \"seeking enforceable currency provisions would likely derail the conclusion of the TPP (TransPacific Partnership) given the deep reservations held by our trading partners.\" \"We have a serious concern that in any trade negotiation other countries would insist that an enforceable currency provision be designed so it could be used to challenge legitimate U.S. monetary policy, an outcome we would find unacceptable,\" Lew added. Supporters of the currency provisions, particularly those whose states have a heavy automanufacturing base, argue that currency manipulation has led to the loss of millions of jobs. \"Currency manipulation is the mother of all trade barriers,\" Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell  after the deal on trade promotion authority was announced last week. Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as well as organized labor, oppose the fasttrack authority the first since 2007 that would give Congress an upordown vote on upcoming freetrade agreements without the chance to provide input on the negotiations. It still needs to pass both chambers of Congress and earn a presidential signature. Richard Trumka, head of the AFLCIO which represents 12.5 million American workers, warned Congress would \"give away\" crucial leverage on negotiating better deals for US companies and workers by approving trade promotion authority without enforceable currency provisions. \"If we eliminate currency manipulation, we have the chance to gain almost six million jobs,\" Trumka told the Senate Finance Committee, which holds a vote on the trade bill Wednesday. Democrats have expressed skepticism about the TransPacific Partnership because it would lower barriers to foreign imports and might disadvantage American workers. Many also decry the economic gamesmanship of countries like China, which has long been accused of manipulating its currency in order to boost exports. And while China is not in the TPP, Trumka says accord members Japan, Malaysia and Singapore are also seen as currency manipulators. Schumer  he was \"disappointed\" in Obama efforts to rein in Chinese currency action and suggested Congress come together to pressure Beijing through trade legislation. \"It the one point in time throughout this TPP process where Congress will be able to show to China and the world that it not business as usual,\" Schumer . mlm/sdo Agence FrancePresse',\n",
       " 'Obama makes fresh push for \\'fast track\\' authority Shawn Donnan 22 April 2015 Financial Times (FT.Com) US President Barack Obama on Tuesday stepped up his efforts to win the \"fast track\" authority he needs from Congress to conclude a major Pacific trade deal, dismissing critics within his own party as wrong. Mr Obama has made securing the TransPacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other economies one of the pillars of his secondterm economic policy. The deal would cover some 40 per cent of the global economy and be the biggest regional agreement ever negotiated by the US. But the president needs what is formally known as Trade Promotion Authority from Congress to close the deal with negotiating partners and faces a tough fight with members of his own party to get it. In an interview with MSNBC due to be broadcast Tuesday night, Mr Obama in particular took on criticisms levelled by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator leading the opposition against the trade push. She has argued that the TPP would contribute to what has been an erosion of the American middle class and give undue rights to multinational corporations to challenge the US and other governments before extrajudicial panels. \"I love Elizabeth. We\\'re allies on a whole host of issues. But she wrong on this,\" the president , according to a partial transcript released by MSNBC. The president  securing the TPP was crucial to helping boost the American economy and the politically middle class. \"I\\'ve spent the last six and half  yanking this economy out of the worst recession since the great depression,\" he . \"Every single thing I\\'ve done from the Affordable Care Act to pushing to raise the minimum wage to making sure that young people are able to go to college and get good job training to what we\\'re pushing now in terms of sick pay leave. Everything I do has been focused on \\'how do we make sure the middle class is getting a fair deal\\'.\" \"I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class,\" he . \"And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts they are wrong.\" The comments came as committees in Congress began considering a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would grant the president fasttrack authority, or TPA. Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, told a Senate finance committee hearing on Tuesday that it was vital for Congress to pass TPA. \"Without TPA, the United States will be relegated to the sidelines as other nations negotiate trade agreements without us putting American workers, farmers, and companies at a competitive disadvantage,\" he . The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. <>But Richard Trumka, the head of the AFLCIO, the country biggest trade union and traditionally an ally of the president, told senators the bill introduced last week fell short of what was needed. The consequences of getting it wrong were substantial, he argued, with the TPP and a separate negotiation with the EU potentially covering some 60 per cent of the global economy. \"If [delivering those deals is] not done right you will see the continuation of wage stagnation, you will see inequality continuing to grow . . . You will see the middle class in this country continue to be decimated,\" Mr Trumka told the hearing. Committees in both the Senate and lower House of Representatives are due to consider the fasttrack bill further on Wednesday and Thursday setting up votes in both houses of Congress by early May.

       " 'India to host firstever Global Exhibition on Services BS Reporter 21 April 2015 Business Standard In an effort to position itself as a leading services exporter, India is holding a Global Exhibition on Services (GES) for the first time which will see participation by as many as 60 countries from across the world. The GES, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on April 23 is being organized by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in association with the Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) and Confederation of India Industry (CII). \"The IT and ITeS sector has grown by leaps and bounds. But there are other areas that have to leverage their strength in trade in services. We are, hence, looking at nine to ten other sectors that have shown tremendous potential,\" minister of state (independent charge) for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters here today. Sitharaman also  that the government plans to hold it annually in the month of February from next  onwards. During the twoday event, India will be showcasing its potential in sectors such as Information Technology, telecom, tourism, healthcare, logistics, education, R&D, space and professional services among others. It will also have over 5,000 structured buyerseller meetings. According to commerce secretary Rajeev Kher, apart from foreign participation, a number of states are also participating in the GES showcasing there area of strength in services trade. As many as 39 countries, out of the 60, are going to put up stalls exhibiting their expertise in various services. Some of them are US, UK, South Korea, UAE, Hong Kong, Germany, Malaysia, Thailand and others. The states that are participating are Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Odisha among others. India has the second fastest growing services sector in the world after China. The growth of services sector GDP has been higher than that of the country overall GDP during 20002001 to 20132014. The sector contributes 57 per cent to the country GDP. India is also a leading exporter of services with a CAGR of 20.2 per cent followed by China at 16.6 per cent. India had been also pushing for greater access in the services market under the Doha round of talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, this has not seen much headway due to lack of interest on the part of the developed countries. Ironically, India is also not part of the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), which is currently being negotiated among 23 countries outside the purview of the WTO. US and the European Union are also part of TISA, the talks for which was launched in 2012. Together, these countries account for 70 per cent of world trade in services. Once concluded, it will open the floodgates of services export from across all sectors such as a banking, telecom and construction among others. Business Standard Limited (India)',\n",

According to NRF, trade supports nearly seven million retail jobs and benefits American businesses, families and workers. \"Free and open trade is an essential element of the U.S. economy and its continued expansion and prosperity,\" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay . \"International trade benefits American consumers and families with lowerpriced and morediverse goods, supports millions of American jobs, and creates new investment opportunities for American businesses and retailers, large and small, both here and abroad.\" The report, \"Trade Matters for Retailers and Families,\" was conducted by the Trade Partnership for NRF. It includes details on the number of tradesupported retail jobs in each state and the economic benefits of pending trade agreements such as the TransPacific Partnership with Pacific Rim nations and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. The report follows last week introduction of legislation that would renew Trade Promotion Authority. Under TPA, the administration would be required to consult with Congress to set negotiating objectives and priorities and require Congress to hold a straight upordown vote once agreements are finalized. \"We applaud congressional action to renew trade promotion authority,\" Shay . \"It is critical that Congress quickly consider the bill in order to advance pending trade agreements with our allies and trading partners in Asia and Europe.\" \"Tearing down trade barriers and repealing marketdistorting tariffs is in everyone economic and strategic interests,\" Shay . \"Approving trade agreements like the TPP and TTIP will not only benefit American businesses but also American consumers and workers. We hope this report helps Congress understand the positive role that international trade plays in individual states and congressional districts.\" NRF strongly supports international trade agreements that eliminate import tariffs on goods and services and open up new markets for U.S. companies. Along with seeking TPA renewal, TPP and TTIP, NRF also supports the longterm extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and retroactive renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences. NRF is the world largest retail trade association, representing discount and department stores, home goods and specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from the United States and more than 45 countries.

       " 'U.S. Democrats Want to Amend Pacific Trade Bill By Siobhan Hughes and William Mauldin 22 April 2015 The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON A bloc of congressional Democrats is bucking White House pressure to exclude concerns over currency manipulation from a bill to expedite a Pacific trade pact, widening a rift between President Barack Obama and his base that threatens the trade deal passage. The White House and Republicans have formed an unusual alliance in favor of fasttrack legislation to put the proposed 12nation trade deal to an upordown vote without amendments. But as Mr. Obama seeks to build a coalition to pass the trade bill, he faces a threat from New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and his Democratic allies. Mr. Schumer, who has long pushed for measures to crack down on China currencymanagement practices, sees the trade legislation as the last chance to take action as China rises as a big economic competitor of the U.S., with jobs tied to highend manufacturing and services in the balance. \"If not now, when?\" Mr. Schumer  in an interview. The coming trade debate over whether to give the White House fasttrack authority for the first time in 13 , he , is \"perhaps the last train to leave the station when it comes to the rapacious policies of China.\" The currency fight is turning the White House major selling point for the TransPacific Partnership deal on its head. The Obama administration portrays the pact which would include nations such as Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam as a strategic counterweight to China, which isn\\'t part of the trade deal. But if that is the aim, Mr. Schumer and others ask, why not go after the currency lever that critics say the Asian nation has long used to give its exports an edge. For , U.S. officials and lawmakers have criticized China for holding its yuan down against the dollar. But some economists say Beijing gradual appreciation of the yuan over the past decade means the value of China currency is now roughly in line with market fundamentals. Although last  saw China intervening to keep a lid on the value of the yuan amid concern a stronger currency was undermining the country exports U.S. officials say Beijing appears to have largely refrained from such intervention since then. In a letter to Senate committee leaders Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  other countries \"have made clear that they will not support the introduction of enforceable currency provisions in the context of trade agreements, and specifically, the TPP.\" Mr. Schumer currency legislation has passed the Senate previously, and he is now threatening to offer it as an amendment in a Wednesday committee vote or on the floor of the Senate. If approved, the amendment could weaken the chances for the overall fasttrack bill, which would become less palatable to fasttrack supporters, including some business groups. White House officials are seeking to head off Mr. Schumer and other lawmakers for fear that adding currency rules to the Pacific trade negotiations could sour the talks when they are close to completion. They also worry that rules restricting monetary policy, even if narrowly tailored, could backfire by restricting legitimate efforts by central banks to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and other measures. In an interview Tuesday on MSNBC, Mr. Obama pushed back against critics on the left, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), an opponent of the Pacific deal. \"I love Elizabeth. We\\'re allies on a whole host of issues,\" he . \"But she wrong on this.\" The first test will come when the Senate Finance Committee votes Wednesday on the fasttrack bill, also known as Trade Promotion Authority. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) has been working to steer Mr. Schumer away from offering the amendment by promising to hold hearings instead, but that is unlikely to satisfy Mr. Schumer. Mr. Hatch will rule Wednesday on whether an amendment from Mr. Schumer is in order. One part of the calculation: A currency provision could help win Democratic votes. \"I\\'m very comfortable including currency manipulation,\"  Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), a member of the committee. \"I\\'m one of those who trying to get to yes in moving forward with fast track, so I\\'d like to see more of those issues.\" Dow Jones & Company, Inc.',\n",

Each observation is assigned to a cluster (cluster assignment) so as to minimize the within cluster sum of squares.

Then, observations are reassigned to clusters and  centroids recalculated in an iterative process until the algorithm reaches convergence.\n",

    "The clustering plot looks great, but it pains my eyes to see overlapping labels. Having some experience with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) I knew one solution would be to use a browser based/javascript interactive. Fortunately, I recently stumbled upon [mpld3](https://mpld3.github.io/) a matplotlib wrapper for D3. Mpld3 basically let's you use matplotlib syntax to create web interactives. It has a really easy, high-level API for adding tooltips on mouse hover, which is what I am interested in.\n",

Don't worry about it too much and you actually don't need to use it, but it helped for formatting purposes when exporting to the web later. The only thing you might want to change is the x and y attr for the position of the toolbar."

    "Here is the actual creation of the interactive scatterplot. I won't go into much more detail about it since it's pretty much a straightforward copy of one of the mpld3 examples, though I use a pandas groupby to group by cluster, then iterate through the groups as I layer the scatterplot. Note that relative to doing this with raw D3, mpld3 is much simpler to integrate into your Python workflow. If you click around the rest of my website you'll see that I do love D3, but for basic interactives I will probably use mpld3 a lot going forward.\n",

    "Now that I was successfuly able to cluster and plot the documents using k-means, I wanted to try another clustering algorithm. I chose the [Ward clustering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method) because it offers hierarchical clustering. Ward clustering is an agglomerative clustering method, meaning that at each stage, the pair of clusters with minimum between-cluster distance are merged. I used the precomputed cosine distance matrix (*dist*) to calclate a linkage_matrix, which I then plot as a dendrogram. \n",

    "This section focuses on using [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) to learn yet more about the hidden structure within the top 100 film synopses. LDA is a probabilistic topic model that assumes documents are a mixture of topics and that each word in the document is attributable to the document's topics. There is quite a good high-level overview of probabilistic topic models by one of the big names in the field, David Blei, available in the [Communications of the ACM here](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2140000/2133826/p77-blei.pdf?ip=68.48.185.120&id=2133826&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&CFID=612398453&CFTOKEN=48760790&__acm__=1419436704_2d47aefe0700e44f81eb822df659a341). Incidentally, Blei was one of the authors of the seminal paper on LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my implementaiton of LDA, I use the [Gensim pacakage](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). I'm going to preprocess the synopses a bit differently here, and first I define a function to remove any proper noun."
