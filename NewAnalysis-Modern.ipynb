       "'world trade organization celebrates 20 years of helping global economy grow. GENEVA, Jan 1 (KUNA)    The World Trade Organization (world trade organization) celebrated Thursday the 20th anniversary of its foundation to be the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Over the past 20 years, this organization has, on balance, made an important contribution to the global economy and to smoother trading relations between nations, world trade organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said in a press release. 20 years ago, on 1 January 1995, the world trade organization opened its doors for business. Since then this organization, and the system of transparent, multilaterally agreed rules that it embodies, has made a major contribution to the strength and stability of the global economy, Azevedo said in a press release from the world trade organization headquarters in Geneva. He pointed that the world trade organization, over the past two decades, has helped to boost trade growth, resolve numerous trade disputes and support developing countries to integrate into the trading system. Indeed, when the global economy is more interconnected than ever, it is difficult to imagine a world without the world trade organization, he said. Azevedo added that the world trade organization has also provided a bulwark against protectionism, the value of which was made plain in the trade policy response to the 2008 crisis, which was very calm and restrained in contrast to the protectionist panic that followed previous crises. Our organization has evolved since 1995. We have welcomed 33 new members, ranging from some of world largest economies to some of the least developed. Today our 160 members account for approximately 98 per cent of global trade, he explained. Moreover, at our 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we took our first major step forward in updating multilateral trade rules. The measures agreed in Bali were a real breakthrough for the world trade organization, and they will provide a significant economic boost. In December 2014 world trade organization Members came together to recommit to implementing all aspects of the Bali package. According to Azevedo, 2015 is set to be an eventful year for the world trade organization. We will be working to implement all aspects of the Bali package and we already have a full negotiating agenda   including a deadline of July to conclude a detailed road map to tackle the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda, he said. The world trade organization will also be seeking to make progress in negotiations on trade in environmental goods and on an agreement to remove tariffs on a wide range of information technology products.

We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our reviews and looking for words that _co-occur_ (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. The formula our phrase models will use to determine whether two tokens $A$ and $B$ constitute a phrase is:\n",

       "'world trade organization celebrates 20 years of helping global economy grow. GENEVA, Jan 1 (KUNA)    The World Trade Organization (world trade organization) celebrated Thursday the 20th anniversary of its foundation to be the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Over the past 20 years, this organization has, on balance, made an important contribution to the global economy and to smoother trading relations between nations, world trade organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said in a press release. 20 years ago, on 1 January 1995, the world trade organization opened its doors for business. Since then this organization, and the system of transparent, multilaterally agreed rules that it embodies, has made a major contribution to the strength and stability of the global economy, Azevedo said in a press release from the world trade organization headquarters in Geneva. He pointed that the world trade organization, over the past two decades, has helped to boost trade growth, resolve numerous trade disputes and support developing countries to integrate into the trading system. Indeed, when the global economy is more interconnected than ever, it is difficult to imagine a world without the world trade organization, he said. Azevedo added that the world trade organization has also provided a bulwark against protectionism, the value of which was made plain in the trade policy response to the 2008 crisis, which was very calm and restrained in contrast to the protectionist panic that followed previous crises. Our organization has evolved since 1995. We have welcomed 33 new members, ranging from some of world largest economies to some of the least developed. Today our 160 members account for approximately 98 per cent of global trade, he explained. Moreover, at our 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we took our first major step forward in updating multilateral trade rules. The measures agreed in Bali were a real breakthrough for the world trade organization, and they will provide a significant economic boost. In December 2014 world trade organization Members came together to recommit to implementing all aspects of the Bali package. According to Azevedo, 2015 is set to be an eventful year for the world trade organization. We will be working to implement all aspects of the Bali package and we already have a full negotiating agenda   including a deadline of July to conclude a detailed road map to tackle the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda, he said. The world trade organization will also be seeking to make progress in negotiations on trade in environmental goods and on an agreement to remove tariffs on a wide range of information technology products.

      "world trade organization celebrates 20 years of helping global economy grow. GENEVA, Jan 1 (KUNA)    The World Trade Organization (world trade organization) celebrated Thursday the 20th anniversary of its foundation to be the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Over the past 20 years, this organization has, on balance, made an important contribution to the global economy and to smoother trading relations between nations, world trade organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said in a press release. 20 years ago, on 1 January 1995, the world trade organization opened its doors for business. Since then this organization, and the system of transparent, multilaterally agreed rules that it embodies, has made a major contribution to the strength and stability of the global economy, Azevedo said in a press release from the world trade organization headquarters in Geneva. He pointed that the world trade organization, over the past two decades, has helped to boost trade growth, resolve numerous trade disputes and support developing countries to integrate into the trading system. Indeed, when the global economy is more interconnected than ever, it is difficult to imagine a world without the world trade organization, he said. Azevedo added that the world trade organization has also provided a bulwark against protectionism, the value of which was made plain in the trade policy response to the 2008 crisis, which was very calm and restrained in contrast to the protectionist panic that followed previous crises. Our organization has evolved since 1995. We have welcomed 33 new members, ranging from some of world largest economies to some of the least developed. Today our 160 members account for approximately 98 per cent of global trade, he explained. Moreover, at our 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we took our first major step forward in updating multilateral trade rules. The measures agreed in Bali were a real breakthrough for the world trade organization, and they will provide a significant economic boost. In December 2014 world trade organization Members came together to recommit to implementing all aspects of the Bali package. According to Azevedo, 2015 is set to be an eventful year for the world trade organization. We will be working to implement all aspects of the Bali package and we already have a full negotiating agenda   including a deadline of July to conclude a detailed road map to tackle the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda, he said. The world trade organization will also be seeking to make progress in negotiations on trade in environmental goods and on an agreement to remove tariffs on a wide range of information technology products.

    "*Topic modeling* is family of techniques that can be used to describe and summarize the documents in a corpus according to a set of latent \"topics\". For this demo, we'll be using [*Latent Dirichlet Allocation*](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) or LDA, a popular approach to topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many conventional NLP applications, documents are represented a mixture of the individual tokens (words and phrases) they contain. In other words, a document is represented as a *vector* of token counts. There are two layers in this model &mdash; documents and tokens &mdash; and the size or dimensionality of the document vectors is the number of tokens in the corpus vocabulary. This approach has a number of disadvantages:\n",
    "* Document vectors tend to be large (one dimension for each token $\\Rightarrow$ lots of dimensions)\n",
    "* They also tend to be very sparse. Any given document only contains a small fraction of all tokens in the vocabulary, so most values in the document's token vector are 0.\n",
    "* The dimensions are fully indepedent from each other &mdash; there's no sense of connection between related tokens, such as _knife_ and _fork_.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA injects a third layer into this conceptual model. Documents are represented as a mixture of a pre-defined number of *topics*, and the *topics* are represented as a mixture of the individual tokens in the vocabulary. The number of topics is a model hyperparameter selected by the practitioner. LDA makes a prior assumption that the (document, topic) and (topic, token) mixtures follow [*Dirichlet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) probability distributions. This assumption encourages documents to consist mostly of a handful of topics, and topics to consist mostly of a modest set of the tokens."

    "### Wait, what am I looking at again?\n",
    "There are a lot of moving parts in the visualization. Here's a brief summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the left, there is a plot of the \"distance\" between all of the topics (labeled as the _Intertopic Distance Map_)\n",
    "  * The plot is rendered in two dimensions according a [*multidimensional scaling (MDS)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) algorithm. Topics that are generally similar should be appear close together on the plot, while *dis*similar topics should appear far apart.\n",
    "  * The relative size of a topic's circle in the plot corresponds to the relative frequency of the topic in the corpus.\n",
    "  * An individual topic may be selected for closer scrutiny by clicking on its circle, or entering its number in the \"selected topic\" box in the upper-left.\n",
    "* On the right, there is a bar chart showing top terms.\n",
    "  * When no topic is selected in the plot on the left, the bar chart shows the top-30 most \"salient\" terms in the corpus. A term's *saliency* is a measure of both how frequent the term is in the corpus and how \"distinctive\" it is in distinguishing between different topics.\n",
    "  * When a particular topic is selected, the bar chart changes to show the top-30 most \"relevant\" terms for the selected topic. The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter $\\lambda$, which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.\n",
    "    * Setting the $\\lambda$ parameter close to 1.0 (the default) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.\n",
    "    * Setting $\\lambda$ close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their \"distinctiveness\" or \"exclusivity\" within the topic &mdash; i.e., terms that occur *only* in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.\n",
    "    * Setting $\\lambda$ to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly.\n",
    "* Rolling the mouse over a term in the bar chart on the right will cause the topic circles to resize in the plot on the left, to show the strength of the relationship between the topics and the selected term.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed explanation of the pyLDAvis visualization can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LDAvis/vignettes/details.pdf). Unfortunately, though the data used by gensim and pyLDAvis are the same, they don't use the same ID numbers for topics. If you need to match up topics in gensim's `LdaMulticore` object and pyLDAvis' visualization, you have to dig through the terms manually."

    "### Analyzing our LDA model\n",
    "The interactive visualization pyLDAvis produces is helpful for both:\n",
    "1. Better understanding and interpreting individual topics, and\n",
    "1. Better understanding the relationships between the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1), you can manually select each topic to view its top most freqeuent and/or \"relevant\" terms, using different values of the $\\lambda$ parameter. This can help when you're trying to assign a human interpretable name or \"meaning\" to each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2), exploring the _Intertopic Distance Plot_ can help you learn about how topics relate to each other, including potential higher-level structure between groups of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our plot, there is a stark divide along the x-axis, with two topics far to the left and most of the remaining 48 far to the right. Inspecting the two outlier topics provides a plausible explanation: both topics contain many non-English words, while most of the rest of the topics are in English. So, one of the main attributes that distinguish the reviews in the dataset from one another is their language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding isn't entirely a surprise. In addition to English-speaking cities, the Yelp dataset includes reviews of businesses in Montreal and Karlsruhe, Germany, often written in French and German, respectively. Multiple languages isn't a problem for our demo, but for a real NLP application, you might need to ensure that the text you're processing is written in English (or is at least tagged for language) before passing it along to some downstream processing. If that were the case, the divide along the x-axis in the topic plot would immediately alert you to a potential data quality issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The y-axis separates two large groups of topics &mdash; let's call them \"super-topics\" &mdash; one in the upper-right quadrant and the other in the lower-right quadrant. These super-topics correlate reasonably well with the pattern we'd noticed while naming the topics:\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *lower*-right tends to be about *food*. It groups together the **burger & fries**, **breakfast**, **sushi**, **barbecue**, and **greek** topics, among others.\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *upper*-right tends to be about other elements of the *restaurant experience*. It groups together the **ambience & seating**, **location & time**, **family**, and **customer service** topics, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in addition to the 50 direct topics the model has learned, our analysis suggests a higher-level pattern in the data. Restaurant reviewers in the Yelp dataset talk about two main things in their reviews, in general: (1) the food, and (2) their overall restaurant experience. For this dataset, this is a very intuitive result, and we probably didn't need a sophisticated modeling technique to tell it to us. When working with datasets from other domains, though, such high-level patterns may be much less obvious from the outset &mdash; and that's where topic modeling can help."

    "### Describing text with LDA\n",
    "Beyond data exploration, one of the key uses for an LDA model is providing a compact, quantitative description of natural language text. Once an LDA model has been trained, it can be used to represent free text as a mixture of the topics the model learned from the original corpus. This mixture can be interpreted as a probability distribution across the topics, so the LDA representation of a paragraph of text might look like 50% _Topic A_, 20% _Topic B_, 20% _Topic C_, and 10% _Topic D_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an LDA model to generate a vector representation of new text, you'll need to apply any text preprocessing steps you used on the model's training corpus to the new text, too. For our model, the preprocessing steps we used include:\n",
    "1. Using spaCy to remove punctuation and lemmatize the text\n",
    "1. Applying our first-order phrase model to join word pairs\n",
    "1. Applying our second-order phrase model to join longer phrases\n",
    "1. Removing stopwords\n",
    "1. Creating a bag-of-words representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've applied these preprocessing steps to the new text, it's ready to pass directly to the model to create an LDA representation. The `lda_description(...)` function will perform all these steps for us, including printing the resulting topical description of the input text."

    "The goal of *word vector embedding models*, or *word vector models* for short, is to learn dense, numerical vector representations for each term in a corpus vocabulary. If the model is successful, the vectors it learns about each term should encode some information about the *meaning* or *concept* the term represents, and the relationship between it and other terms in the vocabulary. Word vector models are also fully unsupervised &mdash they learn all of these meanings and relationships solely by analyzing the text of the corpus, without any advance knowledge provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best-known word vector model is [word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781v3.pdf), originally proposed in 2013. The general idea of word2vec is, for a given *focus word*, to use the *context* of the word &mdash; i.e., the other words immediately before and after it &mdash; to provide hints about what the focus word might mean. To do this, word2vec uses a *sliding window* technique, where it considers snippets of text only a few tokens long at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the learning process, the model initializes random vectors for all terms in the corpus vocabulary. The model then slides the window across every snippet of text in the corpus, with each word taking turns as the focus word. Each time the model considers a new snippet, it tries to learn some information about the focus word based on the surrouding context, and it \"nudges\" the words' vector representations accordingly. One complete pass sliding the window across all of the corpus text is known as a training *epoch*. It's common to train a word2vec model for multiple passes/epochs over the corpus. Over time, the model rearranges the terms' vector representations such that terms that frequently appear in similar contexts have vector representations that are *close* to each other in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into word2vec's machine learning process, see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v4.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec has a number of user-defined hyperparameters, including:\n",
    "- The dimensionality of the vectors. Typical choices include a few dozen to several hundred.\n",
    "- The width of the sliding window, in tokens. Five is a common default choice, but narrower and wider windows are possible.\n",
    "- The number of training epochs.\n",
    "\n",

It offers a [highly-optimized](https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-in-python-part-two-optimizing/), [parallelized](https://rare-technologies.com/parallelizing-word2vec-in-python/) implementation of the word2vec algorithm with its [Word2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) class."
